  "/wiki/1924_Cuba_hurricane": "The 1924 Cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale ( SSHS ) , and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on Cuba at Category 5 intensity , the other being Hurricane Irma in 2017 - both are also tied for the strongest Cuban landfall in terms of maximum sustained winds . The hurricane formed on October 14 in the western Caribbean , slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward . By October 16 , the storm attained hurricane status to the east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop . On October 18 , the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and , on the next day , reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph ( 270 km/h ) . Shortly thereafter , it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity , becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country . Later the hurricane weakened greatly , striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km/h ) in a sparsely populated region . While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status , and after accelerating east-northeastward , it was absorbed by a cold front on October 23 , to the south of Bermuda . Across the western Caribbean Sea , the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds . Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage , with two small towns nearly destroyed . About 90 people were killed in the country , all in Pinar del R\u00edo Province . Later , the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida , which caused flooding and crop damage . Damage was light in the state , and there were no casualties",
  "/wiki/1924_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1924 Atlantic hurricane season featured the earliest known Category 5 hurricane - a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds exceeding 155 mph ( 250 km/h ) . The first system , Tropical Storm One , was first detected in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 18 . The final system , an unnumbered tropical depression , dissipated on November 24 . These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic . Of the 13 tropical cyclones of the season , six existed simultaneously . The season was average with 11 tropical storms , three of which strengthened into hurricanes . Further , two of those three intensified into major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale . The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Ten , nicknamed the 1924 Cuba hurricane . It struck western Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane , before weakening and making landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane . Severe damage and 90 fatalities were collectively reported at both locations . Another system , Hurricane Four , brought strong winds and flooding to the Leeward Islands . The storm left 59 deaths , 30 of which were on Montserrat alone",
  "/wiki/1932_Cuba_hurricane": "The 1932 Cuba hurricane , known also as the Hurricane of Santa Cruz del Sur or the 1932 Camag\u00fcey hurricane , was the deadliest and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in Cuban history . It is the only Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded in November , as well as the strongest November hurricane on record in the Atlantic Basin . The cyclone had a path through the Caribbean Sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the Atlantic hurricane season . The storm 's strong winds , storm surge , and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern Cuba , where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century . Though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on Cuba , significant effects were also felt in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas , with lesser effects felt elsewhere . The tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the Lesser Antilles on October 30 , and tracked westward into the Caribbean Sea , reaching tropical storm strength the next day . Moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the Caribbean , the storm reached hurricane strength on November 2 before a period of rapid intensification ensued . On November 6 , the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph ( 280 km/h ) . The storm weakened to Category 4 intensity while recurving northeast , moving ashore Cuba 's Camag\u00fcey Province on November 9 with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km/h ) . After traversing the island , the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central Bahamas Islands and near Bermuda . On November 13 , the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day . As an intensifying hurricane in the southern Caribbean Sea , the storm moved near the Netherlands Antilles and Colombia , causing widespread effects",
  "/wiki/1932_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1932 Atlantic hurricane season was the period during 1932 in which tropical cyclones formed in the Atlantic Basin . It was a relatively active season , with fifteen known storms , six hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . [ nb 1 ] Two storms attained Category 5 intensity , the first known occurrence in which multiple Category 5 hurricanes formed in the same year . The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm One on May 5 , and ended with the dissipation of Hurricane Fourteen , also known as the 1932 Cuba hurricane , on November 14 . Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes , especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration , may have remained undetected . Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s , historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable . The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project discovered four new tropical cyclones , all of which were tropical storms , that occurred during the year . These storms were later added to the HURDAT database . In total , the season resulted in at least 3,384 fatalities and at least $ 77.706 million in damages . [ nb 2 ] A strong hurricane struck Freeport , Texas in mid-August , severely affecting a large swath of the coast . A Category 5 hurricane , the first of the season , devastated areas of The Bahamas , especially the Abaco Islands . Another strong Category 4 hurricane struck Puerto Rico in late September , leaving catastrophic damage and causing $ 30 million in damages",
  "/wiki/1935_Labor_Day_hurricane": "The Great Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 ( formally known as Hurricane Three ) was the most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall on record in terms of pressure , and tied with Hurricane Dorian in 2019 for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane by maximum sustained winds , with winds of 185 mph ( 295 km/h ) at landfall . It was also the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record until Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 . The fourth tropical cyclone , third tropical storm , second hurricane , and second major hurricane of the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season , the Labor Day hurricane was one of four Category 5 hurricanes on record to strike the contiguous United States , along with Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . In addition , it was the third most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure , behind Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 , and Hurricane Wilma in 2005 . The hurricane intensified rapidly , passing near Long Key on the evening of Monday , September 2 . The region was swept by a massive storm surge as the eye passed over the area . The waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean ; however , gale-force winds and high seas persisted into Tuesday , preventing rescue efforts . The storm continued northwestward along the Florida west coast , weakening before its second landfall near Cedar Key , Florida , on September 4 . The compact and intense hurricane caused catastrophic damage in the upper Florida Keys , as a storm surge of approximately 18 to 20 feet ( 5.5 to 6.1 m ) swept over the low-lying islands . The hurricane 's strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between Tavernier and Marathon . The town of Islamorada was obliterated . Portions of the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway were severely damaged or destroyed",
  "/wiki/1935_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1935 Atlantic hurricane season ran from June 1 through November 30 , 1935 . The 1935 season featured below average activity , but it was eventful . A Category 1 hurricane in the Caribbean killed an estimated 2,150 people in the Greater Antilles and Central America . A Category 3 storm hit central Cuba and grazed Miami . An extratropical hurricane hit Newfoundland . The third tropical cyclone of the season struck the Florida Keys in southern Florida as a Category 5 hurricane ; it remains the strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States or anywhere in the Atlantic basin , tied with Dorian of 2019 . A rare November hurricane also affected the Miami - Fort Lauderdale area . The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 106 units , ranking it as a near-normal year . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACE . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km/h ) , which is tropical storm strength",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Janet": "Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record . Janet was also the first named storm to have 1,000 deaths and the first Category 5 named storm to be retired . The eleventh tropical storm , ninth hurricane , and fourth major hurricane of the year , [ nb 1 ] Janet formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21 . Moving westward across the Caribbean Sea , Janet fluctuated in intensity , but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph ( 282 km/h ) . The intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal , Mexico on September 28 . After weakening over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , it moved into the Bay of Campeche , where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29 . Janet quickly weakened over Mexico 's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30 . In its developmental stages , Janet caused $ 7.8 million in damage to the Lesser Antilles and 189 deaths in the Grenadines and Barbados . [ nb 2 ] While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea , a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost , with all eleven crew members believed to be perished . This remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane . A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , Janet caused severe devastation in areas of Quintana Roo and British Honduras . Only five buildings in Chetumal , Mexico remained intact after the storm , and an estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo",

The fifth tropical cyclone , named storm , and hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , Esther developed from an area of disturbed weather hundreds of miles west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on September 10 . Moving northwestward , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September 11 , before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day . Early on September 13 , Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane . The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in a west-northwestward direction . Late on September 17 , Esther strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph ( 260 km/h ) on September 18 . The storm curved north-northeastward on September 19 , while offshore of North Carolina . Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category 3 intensity on September 21 .

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Hattie": "Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , reaching a peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane . The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season , Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27 . Moving generally northward , the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day . Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph ( 270 km/h ) . It weakened to Category 4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31 . The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America , dissipating on November 1 . Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean , where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island . It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba , prompting evacuations on the island . While turning west , Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to 11.5 in ( 290 mm ) on Grand Cayman . The country of Belize , at the time known as British Honduras , sustained the worst damage from the hurricane . [ nb 1 ] The former capital , Belize City , was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge . The territory governor estimated that 70 % of the buildings in the city had been damaged , leaving more than 10,000 people homeless",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Camille": "Hurricane Camille was the second most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the United States . The most intense storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season , Camille originated as a tropical depression on August 14 , south of Cuba , from a long-tracked tropical wave . Located in a favorable environment for strengthening , the storm quickly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane before striking the western part of Cuba on August 15 . Emerging into the Gulf of Mexico , Camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards the Louisiana-Mississippi region . Despite weakening slightly on August 17 , the hurricane quickly re-intensified back into a Category 5 hurricane before it made landfall a half-hour before midnight in Bay St. Louis , Mississippi . At peak intensity , the hurricane had a minimum pressure of 900 mbar ( 26.58 inHg ) . This was the second-lowest pressure recorded for a U.S. landfall , and is one of just four hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S at Category 5 status . Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall . As Camille pushed inland , it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the Ohio Valley . Once it emerged offshore , Camille was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm , before it became extratropical on August 22 . Camille was subsequently absorbed by a frontal storm over the North Atlantic on the same day . Camille caused tremendous damage in its wake , and produced a peak official storm surge of 24 feet ( 7.3 m )",

The hurricane season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 . The season had the highest number of systems reach hurricane status - twelve - in a single season , until that record was surpassed in 2005 . The season was above-average despite an El Ni\u00f1o , which typically suppresses activity in the Atlantic Ocean , while increasing tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific Ocean . Activity began with a series of five tropical depressions , the first of which developed on May 29 . The third system in that series , Tropical Depression Seven , caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Jamaica in early June . The final in the series formed on July 25 , the same day that Tropical Storm Anna developed . Neither the former nor latter caused significant impact on land . Later in the season , Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine caused severe local flooding in the Florida Panhandle and southwestern Georgia in September . Hurricane Blanche was a small and short-lived tropical cyclone in mid-August that resulted in minimal effects . The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Camille , which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on August 17 and devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States upon striking Mississippi the next day . Strong winds and storm surge heights especially impacted Mississippi and Louisiana",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Allen": "Hurricane Allen was a rare and extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that struck the Caribbean , eastern and northern Mexico , and southern Texas in August 1980 . The first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season , it was the fifth most intense Atlantic Hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure , behind Hurricane Rita , the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Gilbert , and Hurricane Wilma . It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on three separate occasions , and spent more time as a Category 5 than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes . Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190 mph ( 305 km/h ) , [ nb 1 ] thus making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed . Until Hurricane Patricia in 2015 , these were also the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere . Throughout its life , Allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to north-westerly course through the tropical Atlantic Ocean , Caribbean Sea , and Gulf of Mexico before making its final landfall near the United States-Mexico border . At peak strength , it passed near Haiti , causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage . After crossing the Gulf of Mexico , Allen weakened as it struck the lower Texas coast , causing high winds , a significant storm surge , and heavy rainfall , which caused damage to southern Texas . Overall , Allen killed at least 269 people and left $ 2.57 billion in damages ( 1980 US dollars ) , mostly within the United States and Haiti . Because of its impact , the name Allen was retired from the six-year revolving list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and the name was replaced by Andrew . The name Andrew was subsequently retired after the 1992 season 's Hurricane Andrew . The remnants of the storm precipitated the end of the heat wave of 1980 in places like Dallas/Fort Worth , Texas , which had recorded 69 days of 100 \u00b0F ( 38 \u00b0C ) heat",

It was a powerful Cape Verde hurricane that formed during the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season , originating from a tropical wave on September 16 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean . After remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days , Gloria intensified into a hurricane on September 22 north of the Lesser Antilles . During that time , the storm had moved generally westward , although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge . Gloria quickly intensified on September 24 , and the next day reached peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km/h ) . The hurricane weakened before striking the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 27 . Later that day , Gloria made two subsequent landfalls on Long Island and across the coastline of western Connecticut , before becoming extratropical on September 28 over New England . The remnants moved through Atlantic Canada , eventually dissipating on October 2 . Before Gloria made landfall , the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the East Coast of the United States from South Carolina to Maine . Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated , and the hurricane was described as the storm of the century . In general , Gloria 's strongest winds remained east of the center , which largely spared locations from North Carolina to New Jersey , and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge . Hurricane-force winds and gusts affected much of the path , which knocked down trees and power lines",

  "/wiki/1995_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1995 Atlantic hurricane season is the third-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record , tied with 1887 , 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 , and only behind the 1933 and the 2005 season . It is also considered to be the start of an ongoing era of high-activity tropical cyclone formation . The season produced twenty-one tropical cyclones , nineteen named storms , as well as eleven hurricanes and five major hurricanes . [ nb 1 ] The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin . The first tropical cyclone , Hurricane Allison , developed on June 2 , while the season 's final storm , Hurricane Tanya , transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 1 . The very active Atlantic hurricane activity in 1995 was due to La Ni\u00f1a conditions , that influenced a very inactive Pacific hurricane season . There were four particularly destructive hurricanes during the season , including Luis , Marilyn , Opal and Roxanne . Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn both caused catastrophic damage in the Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands . The former storm was the first hurricane to affect those regions since Hurricane Hugo , while the latter was the most devastating cyclone on those islands since Hugo in 1989 . Opal , the strongest and most intense storm of the season , caused devastation along portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States . Roxanne , a rare late-season major hurricane , [ nb 2 ] caused significant damage when it made landfall in Quintana Roo . Additionally , Erin produced moderate damage in Florida",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Mitch": "Hurricane Mitch is the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record , causing over 11,000 fatalities in Central America in 1998 , including approximately 7,000 in Honduras and 3,800 in Nicaragua due to catastrophic flooding from the slow motion of the storm . It was the deadliest hurricane in Central American history , surpassing Hurricane Fifi-Orlene , which killed slightly fewer people there in 1974 . The thirteenth named storm , ninth hurricane , and third major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season , Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22 , and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions , it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category 5 status , the highest possible rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale . After drifting southwestward and weakening , the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal hurricane . Mitch drifted through Central America , regenerated in the Bay of Campeche , and ultimately struck Florida as a strong tropical storm . It then became extratropical and accelerated northeastward across the North Atlantic , before dissipating on November 9 . At the time , Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October , though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season . In addition , Mitch is the eighth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record . Being the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in over 200 years , Mitch caused catastrophic impacts across its path , but the most disastrous impacts came from Honduras , which suffered over half of the total deaths . The President of Honduras estimated that Mitch set back 50 years of economic development . The storm wrecked about 35,000 houses and damaged another 50,000 , leaving up to 1.5 million people homeless , or about 20 percent of the country 's population . Mitch directly caused $ 2.005 billion in damage , [ nb 1 ] with an additional $ 1.8 billion in indirect costs",
  "/wiki/1998_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1998 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most disastrous Atlantic hurricane seasons on record , featuring the highest number of storm-related fatalities in over 218 years and one of the costliest ever at the time . The season had above average activity , due to the dissipation of the El Ni\u00f1o event and transitioned to La Ni\u00f1a conditions . It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean . The first tropical cyclone , Tropical Storm Alex , developed on July 27 , and the season 's final storm , Hurricane Nicole , became extratropical on December 1 . Several storms made landfall or directly affected land . Hurricane Bonnie made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane in late August , killing five people and causing about $ 1 billion in damage . Hurricane Earl caused $ 79 million in damage and three deaths after making landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane . The most notable storms were Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Mitch . Georges devastated Saint Kitts and Nevis , Puerto-Rico and the Dominican Republic as a major Category 3 storm . Mitch , the strongest storm of the season , was later tied with 2007 's Hurricane Dean for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded . Georges peaked as an intense Category 4 hurricane that moved through many of the Caribbean Islands before making landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi , causing significant damage and at least 600 confirmed deaths while Mitch was a very powerful and destructive late-season Category 5 hurricane that affected much of Central America before making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm . The significant amount of rainfall that Mitch produced across Central America caused significant damage and killed at least 11,000 people , making the system the second deadliest hurricane in recorded history , behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Isabel": "Hurricane Isabel was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Mitch , and the deadliest , costliest , and most intense hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . The ninth named storm , fifth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the season , Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 , in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . It moved northwestward , and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters , it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph ( 270 km/h ) on September 11 . After fluctuating in intensity for four days , during which it displayed annular characteristics , Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina , with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km/h ) on September 18 . Isabel quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on the next day . On September 20 , the extratropical remnants of Isabel were absorbed into another system over Eastern Canada . In North Carolina , the storm surge from Isabel washed out a portion of Hatteras Island to form what was unofficially known as Isabel Inlet . Damage was greatest along the Outer Banks , where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed . The worst of the effects of Isabel occurred in Virginia , especially in the Hampton Roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as Richmond and Baltimore . Virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane . About 64 % of the damage and 69 % of the deaths occurred in North Carolina and Virginia . Electric service was disrupted in areas of Virginia for several days , some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks , and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage",
  "/wiki/2003_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season - the first such occurrence since the 1954 season . The season produced 21 tropical cyclones , of which 16 developed into named storms ; seven cyclones attained hurricane status , of which three reached major hurricane status . With sixteen storms , the season was tied for the sixth-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record . The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isabel , which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; Isabel later struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane , causing $ 5.5 billion in damage ( 2003 USD ) and a total of 51 deaths across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States . The season began with Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20 , prior to the official start of the season ; the bounds of the season are from June 1 to November 30 , which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . In early September , Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane , where it was the worst hurricane since 1926 ; on the island it caused four deaths and $ 300 million in damage ( 2003 USD ) . Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia , particularly Halifax , as a Category 2 hurricane , the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893 . Additionally , Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico , respectively , as minimal hurricanes",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan": "Hurricane Ivan was a large , long-lived , Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread damage in the Caribbean and United States . The cyclone was the ninth named storm , the sixth hurricane and the fourth major hurricane of the active 2004 Atlantic hurricane season . Ivan formed in early September , and reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale ( SSHS ) . Ivan caused catastrophic damage in Grenada as a strong Category 3 storm , heavy damage in Jamaica as a strong Category 4 storm , and then severe damage in Grand Cayman , Cayman Islands , and the western tip of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane . After peaking in strength , the hurricane moved north-northwest across the Gulf of Mexico to strike Pensacola/Milton , Florida and Alabama as a strong Category 3 storm , causing significant damage . Ivan dropped heavy rain on the Southeastern United States as it progressed northeastward and eastward through the Eastern United States , becoming an extratropical cyclone on September 18 . The remnant low of the storm moved into the western subtropical Atlantic and regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 22 , which then moved across Florida and the Gulf of Mexico , and then into Louisiana and Texas , causing minimal damage . Ivan degenerated into a remnant low on September 24 , before dissipating on the next day . Ivan caused an estimated US $ 26.1 billion ( equivalent to $ 35 billion in 2019 ) in damage along its path , of which $ 20.5 billion occurred in the United States",
  "/wiki/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was a very deadly , destructive , and hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season , with over 3,200 deaths and more than $ 61 billion ( 2004 USD ) in damage . More than half of the 16 tropical cyclones brushed or struck the United States . Due to the development of a Modoki El Ni\u00f1o - a rare type of El Ni\u00f1o in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific - activity was above average . The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30 , though the season 's last storm , Otto , dissipated on December 3 , extending the season beyond its traditional boundaries . The first storm , Alex , developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on July 31 , one of the latest dates on record to see the formation of the first system in an Atlantic hurricane season . It brushed the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic , causing one death and $ 7.5 million ( 2004 USD ) in damage . [ nb 1 ] Several storms caused only minor damage , including tropical storms Bonnie , Earl , Hermine , and Matthew . In addition , hurricanes Danielle , Karl , and Lisa , Tropical Depression Ten , Subtropical Storm Nicole and Tropical Storm Otto had no effect on land while tropical cyclones . There are four notable storms : Hurricane Charley , that made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) , causing $ 16 billion in damage in the United States alone . Later in August , Hurricane Frances struck the Bahamas and Florida , causing at least 49 deaths and $ 10.1 billion in damage . The costliest and most intense storm was Hurricane Ivan . It was a Category 5 hurricane that devastated multiple countries adjacent to the Caribbean Sea , before entering the Gulf of Mexico and causing catastrophic damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States , especially in the states of Alabama and Florida",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina": "Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record , tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 , causing $ 125 billion in damage , particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas , and over 1,200 deaths . The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States , behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . Katrina originated on August 23 , 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80 % of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 . The emergency response from federal , state and local governments was widely criticized , resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass",
  "/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history , shattering numerous records . The impact of the season was widespread and catastrophic . Its storms caused an estimated total of 3,960 deaths and approximately $ 180.7 billion ( 2005 USD ) in damage , [ nb 1 ] making it the second costliest season on record , surpassed only by the 2017 season . Of the storms that made landfall , five of the season 's seven major hurricanes - Dennis , Emily , Katrina , Rita , and Wilma - were responsible for the majority of the destruction . Stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane . The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucat\u00e1n and the U.S. states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes ; Cuba , the Bahamas , Haiti , Mississippi , Texas , Alabama , and Tamaulipas were each struck once and brushed by at least one more . The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the United States ' Gulf Coast , where a 30-foot ( 9.1 m ) storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused severe flooding that destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline ; subsequent levee failures in New Orleans , Louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city . Furthermore , Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across Central America , with Guatemala being hardest-hit . The 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical storms and cyclones in the Atlantic than in the West Pacific ; on average , the latter experiences 26 tropical storms per year while the Atlantic only averages 12 . This event was repeated in the 2010 season ; however , the 2010 typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year , while the 2005 typhoon season featured near-average activity . The season officially began on June 1 , 2005 , and lasted until November 30 , although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity . A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed , of which a record fifteen became hurricanes",

Part of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , which included three of the top ten most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded ( along with # 1 Wilma and # 7 Katrina ) , Rita was the seventeenth named storm , tenth hurricane , and fifth major hurricane of the 2005 season . Rita formed near The Bahamas from a tropical wave on September 18 , 2005 that originally developed off the coast of West Africa . It moved westward , and after passing through the Florida Straits , Rita entered an environment of abnormally warm waters . Moving west-northwest , it rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 180 mph ( 285 km/h ) , achieving Category 5 status on September 21st . However , it weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before making landfall in Johnson 's Bayou , Louisiana , between Sabine Pass , Texas and Holly Beach , Louisiana , with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km/h ) . Rapidly weakening over land , Rita degenerated into a large low-pressure area over the lower Mississippi Valley by September 26th . In Louisiana , Rita 's storm surge inundated low-lying communities along the entire coast , worsening effects caused by Hurricane Katrina less than a month prior , such as topping the hurriedly-repaired Katrina-damaged levees at New Orleans . Parishes in Southwest Louisiana and counties in Southeast Texas where Rita made landfall suffered from severe to catastrophic flooding and wind damage . According to an October 25 , 2005 Disaster Center report , 4,526 single-family dwellings were destroyed in Orange and Jefferson counties located in Southeast Texas . Major damage was sustained by 14,256 additional single-family dwellings , and another 26,211 single-family dwellings received minor damage . Mobile homes and apartments also sustained significant damage or total destruction",

Part of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , which included three of the ten most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever ( along with # 4 Rita and # 7 Katrina ) , Wilma was the twenty-second storm , thirteenth hurricane , sixth major hurricane , fourth Category 5 hurricane , and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season . A tropical depression formed in the Caribbean Sea near Jamaica on October 15 , headed westward , and intensified into a tropical storm two days later , which abruptly turned southward and was named Wilma . Wilma continued to strengthen , and eventually became a hurricane on October 18 . Shortly thereafter , explosive intensification occurred , and in only 24 hours , Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 mph ( 298 km/h ) . Wilma 's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane , and winds had decreased to 150 mph ( 240 km/h ) before it reached the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on October 20 and 21 . After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n , Wilma emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane . As it began accelerating to the northeast , gradual re-intensification occurred , and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24 . Shortly thereafter , Wilma made landfall in Cape Romano , Florida with winds of 120 mph ( 190 km/h ) . As Wilma was crossing Florida , it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane , but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean . The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time , before weakening while accelerating northeastward . By October 26 , Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of Nova Scotia",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Dean": "Hurricane Dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season . It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005 , tying for seventh overall . Additionally , it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall . A Cape Verde hurricane that formed on August 13 , 2007 , Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean . It strengthened into a major hurricane , [ nb 1 ] reaching Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20 . The storm made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August 21 at peak intensity . It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened , but still remained a hurricane . It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22 . Dean drifted to the northwest , weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States . Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure , only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region , and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds . The hurricane 's intense winds , waves , rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45 deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US $ 1.66 billion . First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles , Dean 's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops , particularly those of Martinique and Jamaica",

Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007 , it was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane , a feat that would not be matched until ten years later . It produced 17 tropical cyclones , 15 tropical storms , six hurricanes , and two major hurricanes . It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean , although as shown by Subtropical Storm Andrea and Tropical Storm Olga in early May and early December , respectively , the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year . The first system , Subtropical Storm Andrea , developed on May 9 , while the last storm , Tropical Storm Olga , dissipated on December 13 . The most intense hurricane , Dean , is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall . The season was one of only seven on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category 5 hurricane . It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane , Felix , and an eastern Pacific hurricane , Henriette , made landfall on the same day . September had a record-tying eight storms , although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low . Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix , none of the storms in the season exceeded Category 1 intensity . Pre-season forecasts by Colorado State University called for 14 named storms and 7 hurricanes , of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) later issued its initial forecast , which predicted 13 to 17 named storms , 7 to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Irma": "Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in September 2017 . Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record , followed by Maria two weeks later . At the time , it was considered as the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region , outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian just two years later . The ninth named storm , fourth hurricane , second major hurricane , [ nb 1 ] and first Category 5 hurricane of the 2017 season , Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime , particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys . It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005 , the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year , and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004 . The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane . Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30 . Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale by late on August 31 . However , the storm 's intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days , due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles . On September 4 , Irma resumed intensifying , becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day . Early on September 6 , Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180 mph ( 285 km/h ) and a minimum pressure of 914 hPa ( 27.0 inHg ) .

Most of the season 's damage was due to hurricanes Harvey , Irma , and Maria . Another notable hurricane , Nate , was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history . The names Harvey , Irma , Maria , and Nate were retired following the season due to the number of deaths and amount of damage they caused . Collectively , the tropical cyclones were responsible for at least 3,364 deaths - the most fatalities in a single season since 2005 . The season also had the highest accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) since 2005 , with a record three hurricanes each generating an ACE of over 40 : Irma , Jose , and Maria . This season is also one of only seven years on record to feature multiple Category 5 hurricanes and the only season other than 2007 with two hurricanes making landfall at that intensity . It also became the second consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane , with Hurricane Matthew reaching such strength in the previous season . All ten of the season 's hurricanes occurred in a row - the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era , and tied for the highest number of consecutive hurricanes ever observed in the Atlantic basin . The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30 . These dates historically describe the period of year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin and are adopted by convention"
