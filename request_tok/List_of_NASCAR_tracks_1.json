The 2005 race marked the first time that NASCAR had run a Busch Series race on a road course since 2001 , and at one time the Mexico City race was one of three road races on the Busch/Nationwide circuit ( joining races at Watkins Glen and Montreal ) . Much attention was directed towards this race , as it was the first NASCAR points-paying race outside the United States since 1952 . The only recent international races for NASCAR had been those at the Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi ( 1996-1998 ) in Japan , but the races were non-points-paying exhibition races .

The Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez track is a very popular track for open-wheel racing such as Formula One and Champ Car , however the course needed some work to make it suitable for stock cars . The most notable difference was a chicane on the pit straight , and also the addition of a link to eliminate Curva H\u00e9ctor Rebaque , instead adding a long , curve between the track 's short circuit curve and Ese del Lago . This move was made because of the heavy braking of the heavier cars . Unlike the Champ Car race , however , the cars do not use the chicane at Peraltada .
