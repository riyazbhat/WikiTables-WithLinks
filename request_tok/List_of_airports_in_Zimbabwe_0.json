  "/wiki/Provinces_of_Zimbabwe": "Provinces are constituent political entities of Zimbabwe . Zimbabwe currently has ten provinces , two of which are cities with provincial status . Zimbabwe is a unitary state , and its provinces exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate . Provinces are divided into districts , which are divided into wards . The Constitution of Zimbabwe delineates provincial governance and powers . After constitutional amendments in 1988 , provinces were administered by a governor directly appointed by the President of Zimbabwe . Since the 2013 constitutional changes , there are technically no longer provincial governors , though in practice they remain in place as Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs . The 2013 Constitution also calls for the devolution of governmental powers and responsibilities where appropriate , though Zimbabwean opposition parties argue that the central government has yet to comply . With the establishment of Company rule in Rhodesia in the 1890s , the country was divided into two provinces : Matabeleland in the west and Mashonaland in the east . Under British colonial rule as Southern Rhodesia , the colony was divided into five provinces . Later , the Rhodesian government expanded the number of provinces to seven : Manicaland , Matabeleland North and South , Mashonaland North and South , Midlands , and Victoria ( today Masvingo ) . In the 1980s , Mashonaland North and South became three provinces , and the capital , Harare , was made a province .",
