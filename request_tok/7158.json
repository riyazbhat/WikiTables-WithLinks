He was an early advocate and developer of Lema\u00eetre 's Big Bang theory . He discovered a theoretical explanation of alpha decay via quantum tunneling , invented the first mathematical model of the atomic nucleus , the liquid drop model , and worked on radioactive decay , star formation , stellar nucleosynthesis and Big Bang nucleosynthesis ( which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis ) , and molecular genetics . In his middle and late career , Gamow directed much of his attention to teaching and wrote popular books on science , including One Two Three .

It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group , both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain . Consequently , its IUPAC systematic name is 2-aminopropanoic acid , and it is classified as a nonpolar , aliphatic \u03b1-amino acid . Under biological conditions , it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated ( as \u2212NH3+ ) and its carboxyl group deprotonated ( as \u2212CO2\u2212 ) . It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesised metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet . It is encoded by all codons starting with GC ( GCU , GCC , GCA , and GCG ) . The L-isomer of alanine ( left-handed ) is the one that is incorporated into proteins . L-Alanine is second only to leucine in rate of occurrence , accounting for 7.8 % of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins . The right-handed form , D-alanine , occurs in polypeptides in some bacterial cell walls:131 and in some peptide antibiotics , and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte .",

Throughout his life , Teller was known both for his scientific ability and for his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality . Teller was born in Hungary in 1908 , and emigrated to the United States in the 1930s , one of the many so-called Martians , a group of prominent Hungarian scientist emigr\u00e9s . He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics , spectroscopy ( in particular the Jahn-Teller and Renner-Teller effects ) , and surface physics . His extension of Enrico Fermi 's theory of beta decay , in the form of Gamow-Teller transitions , provided an important stepping stone in its application , while the Jahn-Teller effect and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET ) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry . Teller also made contributions to Thomas-Fermi theory , the precursor of density functional theory , a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules . In 1953 , along with Nicholas Metropolis , Arianna Rosenbluth , Marshall Rosenbluth , and his wife Augusta Teller , Teller co-authored a paper that is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics . Teller was an early member of the Manhattan Project , charged with developing the first atomic bomb , and proposed the solid pit implosion design which was successful . He made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well , but these were deferred until after World War II . He did not sign the Szilard petition , which sought to have the bombs detonated as a demonstration , but not on a city , but later agreed that Szilard was right , and the bombs should not have been dropped on a defenceless civilian population .

  "/wiki/Max_Delbr\u00fcck": "Max Ludwig Henning Delbr\u00fcck ( September 4 , 1906 - March 9 , 1981 ) , a German-American biophysicist , helped launch the molecular biology research program in the late 1930s . He stimulated physical scientists ' interest into biology , especially as to basic research to physically explain genes , mysterious at the time . Formed in 1945 and led by Delbr\u00fcck along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey , the Phage Group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of genetics . The three shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses . He was the first physicist to predict what is now called Delbr\u00fcck scattering .",
  "/wiki/Tryptophan": "Tryptophan ( symbol Trp or W ) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins . Tryptophan contains an \u03b1-amino group , an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group , and a side chain indole , making it a non-polar aromatic amino acid . It is essential in humans , meaning the body can not synthesize it ; it must be obtained from the diet . Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin , the hormone melatonin and vitamin B3 . It is encoded by the codon UGG . Like other amino acids , tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated ( -NH3+ ; pKa = 9.39 ) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( -COO\u2212 ; pKa = 2.38 ) .",
  "/wiki/Francis_Crick": "Francis Harry Compton Crick OM FRS ( 8 June 1916 - 28 July 2004 ) was a British molecular biologist , biophysicist , and neuroscientist . In 1953 , he co-authored with James Watson the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule . Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins , he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material . The results were based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin , Raymond Gosling and Wilkins . Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA . He is widely known for the use of the term central dogma to summarize the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids ( DNA or RNA ) to proteins , it can not flow back to nucleic acids . In other words , the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible . During the remainder of his career , he held the post of J.W . Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California . His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness . He remained in this post until his death ; he was editing a manuscript on his death bed , a scientist until the bitter end according to Christof Koch .",
  "/wiki/Tyrosine": "Tyrosine ( symbol Tyr or Y ) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins . It is a non-essential amino acid with a polar side group . The word tyrosine is from the Greek tyr\u00f3s , meaning cheese , as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese . It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain . While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid , it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine . It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA .",
  "/wiki/Sydney_Brenner": "Sydney Brenner CH FRS FMedSci MAE ( 13 January 1927 - 5 April 2019 ) was a South African biologist . In 2002 , he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and Sir John E. Sulston . Brenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code , and other areas of molecular biology while working in the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , England . He established the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology , and founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley , California , United States .",
  "/wiki/Valine": "Valine ( symbol Val or V ) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins . It contains an \u03b1-amino group ( which is in the protonated \u2212NH3+ form under biological conditions ) , an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group ( which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological conditions ) , and a side chain isopropyl group , making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid . It is essential in humans , meaning the body can not synthesize it : it must be obtained from the diet . Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein , such as meats , dairy products , soy products , beans and legumes . It is encoded by all codons starting with GU ( GUU , GUC , GUA , and GUG ) . Like leucine and isoleucine , valine is a branched-chain amino acid . In sickle-cell disease , a single glutamic acid in \u03b2-globin is replaced with valine . Because valine is hydrophobic , whereas glutamic acid is hydrophilic , this change makes the hemoglobin prone to abnormal aggregation ."
