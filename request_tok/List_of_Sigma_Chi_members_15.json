  "/wiki/Major_General": "Major general ( abbreviated MG , maj. gen. and similar ) is a military rank used in many countries . It is derived from the older rank of sergeant major general . The disappearance of the sergeant in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general while a major outranks a lieutenant . In the Commonwealth and the United States , it is a division commander 's rank subordinate to the rank of lieutenant general and senior to the ranks of brigadier and brigadier general . In the Commonwealth , major general is equivalent to the navy rank of rear admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air vice-marshal . In some countries , including much of Eastern Europe , major general is the lowest of the general officer ranks , with no brigadier-grade rank",

The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a brigadier general , or simply a brigadier , would command a brigade in the field . The rank name g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade ( which translates as brigade general ) was first used in the French revolutionary armies . In the first quarter of the 20th century , British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment , or as an honorary appointment on retirement ; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier , which was not classed as a general officer . Some armies , such as Taiwan and Japan , use major general as the equivalent of brigadier general ( See also Japan & Taiwan for details. ) . Some of these armies then use the rank of colonel general to make four general-officer ranks . [ citation needed ] Mexico uses the ranks of both General brigadier and General de brigada",

  "/wiki/Raid_at_Cabanatuan": "The Raid at Cabanatuan ( Filipino : Pagsalakay sa Cabanatuan ) , also known as The Great Raid ( Filipino : Ang Dakilang Pagsalakay ) , was a rescue of Allied prisoners of war ( POWs ) and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City , Philippines . On January 30 , 1945 , during World War II , United States Army Rangers , Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas liberated more than 500 from the POW camp . After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the Battle of Bataan , many were sent to the Cabanatuan prison camp after the Bataan Death March . The Japanese shifted most of the prisoners to other areas , leaving just over 500 American and other Allied POWs and civilians in the prison . Facing brutal conditions including disease , torture , and malnourishment , the prisoners feared they would be executed by their captors before the arrival of General Douglas MacArthur and his American forces returning to Luzon . In late January 1945 , a plan was developed by Sixth Army leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners . A group of over 100 Rangers and Scouts and 200 guerrillas traveled 30 miles ( 48 km ) behind Japanese lines to reach the camp . In a nighttime raid , under the cover of darkness and with distraction by a P-61 Black Widow night fighter , the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp . Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack ; the Americans suffered minimal casualties . The Rangers , Scouts , and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines . The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities , which sparked a rush of resolve for the war against Japan . The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur , and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima": "The Battle of Iwo Jima ( 19 February - 26 March 1945 ) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps and Navy landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II . The American invasion , designated Operation Detachment , had the goal of capturing the entire island , including the three Japanese-controlled airfields ( including the South Field and the Central Field ) , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands . This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II . After the heavy losses incurred in the battle , the strategic value of the island became controversial . It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base . However , Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips , which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s . The IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions , and 18 km ( 11 mi ) of tunnels . The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery , and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle . Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although , uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles , American total casualties ( dead and wounded ) exceeded those of the Japanese . Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle , only 216 were taken prisoner , some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled . The majority of the remainder were killed in action , although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards , eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later . Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides , the American victory was assured from the start"
