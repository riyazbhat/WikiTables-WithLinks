  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Strong_safety": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) .
