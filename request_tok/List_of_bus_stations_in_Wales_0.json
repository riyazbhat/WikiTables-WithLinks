Distinctively , Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it , mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole - one of the closest main rivers is the Severn , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of the city centre . Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy .

It extends from the Anglo-Scottish border in the north to near the River Trent in the south , although precise definitions of its southern extent vary . Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions : the North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Humber . These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331 km2 ( 14,414 sq mi ) . Northern England contains much of England 's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanisation , including the conurbations of Greater Manchester , Merseyside , Teesside , Tyneside , Wearside , and South and West Yorkshire . The region has been controlled by many groups , from the Brigantes , the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain , to the Romans , to Anglo-Saxons and Danes . After the Norman conquest in 1066 , the Harrying of the North brought destruction . The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until the personal union of England and Scotland under the Stuarts , with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times . Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England , and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval , from trade unionism to Manchester Capitalism . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving , shipbuilding , steel-making and mining . The deindustrialisation that followed in the second half of the 20th century hit Northern England hard , and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England . Urban renewal projects and the transition to a service economy have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England , but a definite North-South divide remains both in the economy and the culture of England .",

  "/wiki/Llantwit_Major": "Llantwit Major ( Welsh : Llanilltud Fawr ) is a town and community in Wales . Situated on the Bristol Channel coast , it is one of four towns in the Vale of Glamorgan , with the third largest population ( 13,366 in 2001 ) after Barry and Penarth , and ahead of Cowbridge . Llantwit Major is 4 1\u20442 miles ( 7.2 km ) from Cowbridge , 9 miles ( 14 km ) from Bridgend , 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Barry , and 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Cardiff . Llanilltud Fawr is derived from the name of Saint Illtud , who came to the area from Brittany , Gaul . He founded the monastery of Illtud and the college attached to it , Cor Tewdws , which would grow into one of the most esteemed Christian colleges of the times . At its peak it attracted over 2000 students , including princes and numerous eminent clergymen , some now revered as saints . Destroyed by the Vikings in 987 , the monastery was rebuilt in 1111 and continued to be a centre of learning governed by Tewkesbury Abbey until it closed in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries . The 13th-century St Illtyd 's Church , built near the ancient monastery , is a Grade I listed building and one of the oldest parish churches in Wales . In the 20th century , the modern town developed rapidly to accommodate Royal Air Force personnel from the St Athan base . The medieval cobbled streets and buildings of the 15th and 16th centuries remain . Colhugh Beach is a popular surfing venue and has the remnants of an Iron Age fort and some of the finest examples of Jurassic Period fossils in Wales . The pebble beach and its clifftops are protected by the Glamorgan Heritage Coast , which stretches for 14 miles ( 23 km ) from Gileston to the east to Southerndown and Newton Point to the west ."
