  "/wiki/Tangled": "Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Loosely based on the German fairy tale Rapunzel in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm , it is the 50th Disney animated feature film . Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore , Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy , the film tells the story of a lost , young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower . Against her mother 's wishes , she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen . Before the film 's release , its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally . Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $ 260 million , which , if accurate , would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time . The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting . Composer Alan Menken , who had worked on prior Disney animated features , returned to score Tangled . Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14 , 2010 , and went into general release on November 24 . The film earned $ 591 million in worldwide box office revenue , $ 200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada . The film was nominated for a number of awards , including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards . The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29 , 2011 ; a short film , Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017 .",
