  "/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota": "Saint Paul ( abbreviated St. Paul ) is the capital and second-most populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota . As of 2018 , the city 's estimated population was 307,695 . Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County , the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota . The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River , and adjoins Minneapolis , the state 's largest city . Known as the Twin Cities , the two form the core of Minneapolis-Saint Paul , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States , with about 3.6 million residents . Founded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center , the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 . The Dakota name for Saint Paul is Imnizaska . Regionally , the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center , home of the Minnesota Wild , and for the Science Museum of Minnesota . As a business hub of the Upper Midwest , it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab . Saint Paul , along with its twin city , Minneapolis , is known for its high literacy rate . The settlement originally began at present-day Lambert 's Landing , but was known as Pig 's Eye after Pierre Pig 's Eye Parrant established a popular tavern there . When Lucien Galtier , the first Catholic pastor of the region , established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul ( shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul ) , he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name , as Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated , this monosyllable is short , sounds good , it is understood by all Christian denominations .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The parish was founded in 1887 by Archbishop John Ireland , who wanted to serve German-speaking immigrants who were settling in the Frogtown neighborhood of St. Paul to find work with the Great Northern Railway . The first building was designed by George Bergmann , a St. Paul architect who was also a parishioner . The current building was begun under the direction of Reverend James Trobec , who later became the third bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Cloud . Two competing designs were submitted by architects Hermann Kretz and George Ries , and the design by Ries was selected . Ries modeled his design after Stift Schl\u00e4gl , a Praemonstratensian monastery in Northern Austria near Aigen im M\u00fchlkreis . The Baroque architecture style was familiar to immigrants who came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and southern Germany . It is also influenced by Beaux-Arts ideals of balance and symmetry . Construction began in 1897 , when the basement was built . The basement was used for services while funds were raised to build the full structure . In 1909 , after around $ 200,000 was raised , work on the structure resumed , to be completed in 1912 .",

The term is used to describe architecture and architectural sculptures which display important aspects of Baroque style , but are not of the original Baroque period . Elements of the Baroque architectural tradition were an essential part of the curriculum of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris , the pre-eminent school of architecture in the second half of the 19th century , and are integral to the Beaux-Arts architecture it engendered both in France and abroad . An ebullient sense of European imperialism encouraged an official architecture to reflect it in Britain and France , and in Germany and Italy the Baroque Revival expressed pride in the new power of the unified state .",
  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom .

In English it is also known as the Modern Style ( not to be confused with Modernism and Modern architecture ) . The style was most popular between 1890 and 1910 . It was a reaction against the academic art , eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration . It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers . Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement , often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines , and the use of modern materials , particularly iron , glass , ceramics and later concrete , to create unusual forms and larger open spaces . One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts ( especially painting and sculpture ) and applied arts . It was most widely used in interior design , graphic arts , furniture , glass art , textiles , ceramics , jewelry and metal work . The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians , such as French architect Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc ( 1814-1879 ) and British art critic John Ruskin ( 1819-1900 ) . In Britain , it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement . German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) that would unify the architecture , furnishings , and art in the interior in a common style , to uplift and inspire the residents . The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s , in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar , Henry van de Velde , and especially Victor Horta , whose H\u00f4tel Tassel was completed in 1893 .",
  "/wiki/Reinforced-concrete": "Reinforced concrete ( RC ) ( also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC ) is a composite material in which concrete 's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility . The reinforcement is usually , though not necessarily , steel reinforcing bars ( rebar ) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets . Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure . Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel , polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not . Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed ( concrete in compression , reinforcement in tension ) , so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads . In the United States , the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning . For a strong , ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least :",

The first Polish settlers arrived at Walter Raleigh 's failed Roanoke Colony in 1585 . In 1608 Polish settlers came to the Virginia Colony as skilled craftsmen . Two early Polish visitors , Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko , led armies in the Revolutionary War and are remembered as national heroes . Overall , around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States , between 1820 and 1914 , chiefly after national insurgencies and famine . They included former Polish citizens of Roman Catholic , Protestant , Jewish or other minority descent . Exact immigration figures are unknown . Many immigrants were classified as Russian , German or Austrian by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were under Prussian , Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control . Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

It is 58 feet ( 18 m ) wide and consists of a single oblique span of 70 feet 6 inches ( 21.49 m ) that was built with the arch courses running parallel to the abutments , leading to a weaker structure than other skew arch construction methods , known as a false skew arch . It was designed in 1888 by Andreas W. Munster of the Saint Paul Engineer 's Office and is now restricted to pedestrian traffic .",
  "/wiki/Skew_arch": "A skew arch ( also known as an oblique arch ) is a method of construction that enables an arch bridge to span an obstacle at some angle other than a right angle . This results in the faces of the arch not being perpendicular to its abutments and its plan view being a parallelogram , rather than the rectangle that is the plan view of a regular , or square arch . In the case of a masonry skew arch , the construction requires precise stonecutting , as the cuts do not form right angles , but once the principles were fully understood in the early 19th century , it became considerably easier and cheaper to build a skew arch of brick . The problem of building skew arch masonry bridges was addressed by a number of early civil engineers and mathematicians , including Giovanni Barbara ( 1726 ) , William Chapman ( 1787 ) , Benjamin Outram ( 1798 ) , Peter Nicholson ( 1828 ) , George Stephenson ( 1830 ) , Edward Sang ( 1835 ) , Charles Fox ( 1836 ) , George W.
