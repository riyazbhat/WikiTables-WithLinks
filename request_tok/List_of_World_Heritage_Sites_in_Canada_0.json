  "/wiki/World_Heritage_Site": "A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area , selected by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) for having cultural , historical , scientific or other form of significance , which is legally protected by international treaties . The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity . To be selected , a World Heritage Site must be an already-classified landmark , unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance ( such as an ancient ruin or historical structure , building , city , complex , desert , forest , island , lake , monument , mountain , or wilderness area ) . It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity , and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet . The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity , which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing , unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access , or threat from local administrative negligence . Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones . The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee , composed of 21 states parties that are elected by their General Assembly . The programme catalogues , names , and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity . Under certain conditions , listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund . The programme began with the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World 's Cultural and Natural Heritage , which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972 . Since then , 193 state parties have ratified the convention , making it one of the most widely recognised international agreements and the world 's most popular cultural programme . In 1978 the city of Quito earned the distinction of being the first city in the world to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .",
  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",

Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",

Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier is Jason Kenney as of April 30 , 2019 . Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta .

With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies .

  "/wiki/Rocky_Mountains": "The Rocky Mountains , also known as the Rockies , are a major mountain range located in western North America . The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 km ( 1,900 mi ) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia , in western Canada , to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States . The northern terminus is near the Liard River , while the southernmost point is near Albuquerque , adjacent the Sandia-Manzano Mountains . Located within the North American Cordillera , the Rockies are distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges , Cascade Range , and the Sierra Nevada , which all lie farther to the west . The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny , in which a number of plates began sliding underneath the North American plate . The angle of subduction was shallow , resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America . Since then , further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys . At the end of the last ice age , humans began inhabiting the mountain range . After Europeans , such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie , and Americans , such as the Lewis and Clark expedition , began exploring the range , minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains , although the range itself never experienced a dense population . Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains , 78 ( including the 30 highest ) are located in Colorado , ten in Wyoming , six in New Mexico , and three in Montana . Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range , and they are popular tourist destinations , especially for hiking , camping , mountaineering , fishing , hunting , mountain biking , skiing , and snowboarding .",

It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era . The name is derived from the Latin creta . It is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide . The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas . These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles , ammonites and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land . During this time , new groups of mammals and birds , as well as flowering plants , appeared . The Cretaceous ( along with the Mesozoic ) ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , a large mass extinction in which many groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , pterosaurs and large marine reptiles died out . The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ( K-Pg boundary ) , a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction which lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras .",

  "/wiki/American_bison": "The American bison or simply bison ( Bison bison ) , also commonly known as the American buffalo or simply buffalo , is a North American species of bison that once roamed North America in vast herds . Its historical range , by 9000 BCE , is described as the great bison belt , a tract of rich grassland that ran from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico , east to the Atlantic Seaboard ( nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas ) as far north as New York and south to Georgia and , according to some sources , down to Florida , with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750 . It nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle . With a population in excess of 60 million in the late 18th century , the species was down to 541 animals by 1889 . Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century , with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 animals today , largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves . Two subspecies or ecotypes have been described : the plains bison ( B. b. bison ) , smaller in size and with a more rounded hump , and the wood bison ( B. b. athabascae ) - the larger of the two and having a taller , square hump . Furthermore , the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains ( B. b. montanae ) and a southern plains ( B. b. bison ) subspecies , bringing the total to three . However , this is generally not supported . The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world , surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild yak . Among extant land animals in North America , the bison is the heaviest and the longest , and the second tallest after the moose . Spanning back many centuries , Native American tribes have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison . It is the national mammal of the United States .",

The name Carboniferous means coal-bearing and derives from the Latin words carb\u014d ( coal ) and fer\u014d ( I bear , I carry ) , and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 . Based on a study of the British rock succession , it was the first of the modern 'system ' names to be employed , and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time . The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods , the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian . Terrestrial animal life was well established by the Carboniferous period . Amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates , of which one branch would eventually evolve into amniotes , the first solely terrestrial vertebrates . Arthropods were also very common , and many ( such as Meganeura ) were much larger than those of today . Vast swaths of forest covered the land , which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous stratigraphy evident today . The atmospheric content of oxygen also reached its highest levels in geological history during the period , 35% compared with 21% today , allowing terrestrial invertebrates to evolve to great size . The later half of the period experienced glaciations , low sea level , and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea . A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event , the Carboniferous rainforest collapse , occurred at the end of the period , caused by climate change .",

The Taimyr herd of migrating Siberian tundra reindeer ( R. t. sibiricus ) in Russia is the largest wild reindeer herd in the world , varying between 400,000 and 1,000,000 . What was once the second largest herd is the migratory boreal woodland caribou ( R. t. caribou ) George River herd in Canada , with former variations between 28,000 and 385,000 . As of January 2018 , there are fewer than 9,000 animals estimated to be left in the George River herd , as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . The New York Times reported in April 2018 of the disappearance of the only herd of southern mountain caribou in the lower 48 states , with an expert calling it functionally extinct after the herd 's size dwindled to a mere three animals . Rangifer varies in size and colour from the smallest , the Svalbard reindeer , to the largest , the boreal woodland caribou . The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska through Yukon , the Northwest Territories and Nunavut into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains . The barren-ground caribou , Porcupine caribou , and Peary caribou live in the tundra , while the shy boreal woodland caribou prefer the boreal forest . The Porcupine caribou and the barren-ground caribou form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga . The migrations of Porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any mammal .",

  "/wiki/Acadian": "The Acadians ( French : Acadiens , IPA : [ akadj\u025b\u0303 ] ) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries , many of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region . [ a ] The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada 's Maritime provinces ( Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and Prince Edward Island ) , as well as part of Quebec , and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River . Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France . It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada ( modern-day Quebec ) . As a result , the Acadians and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois developed two distinct histories and cultures . The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France , but especially northern and central regions such as \u00cele-de-France , Normandy , Brittany , Poitou and Aquitaine . During the French and Indian War ( the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War ) , British colonial officers suspected that Acadians were aligned with France , after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beaus\u00e9jour . Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War , the British , together with New England legislators and militia , carried out the Great Expulsion ( Le Grand D\u00e9rangement ) of the Acadians during the 1755-1764 period . They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region . Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning . The result was what one historian described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada . Most Acadians were deported to various British American colonies , where many were forced into servitude or marginal lifestyles .",
  "/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Acadians": "The Expulsion of the Acadians , also known as the Great Upheaval , the Great Expulsion , the Great Deportation and Le Grand D\u00e9rangement , was the forced removal by the British of the Acadian people from the present-day Canadian Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island and northern Maine - parts of an area also known as Acadia . [ b ] The Expulsion ( 1755-1764 ) occurred during the French and Indian War ( the North American theatre of the Seven Years ' War ) [ c ] and was part of the British military campaign against New France . The British first deported Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies , and after 1758 , transported additional Acadians to Britain and France . In all , of the 14,100 Acadians in the region , approximately 11,500 Acadians were deported . [ d ] A census of 1764 indicates that 2,600 Acadians remained in the colony , presumably having eluded capture . During the War of the Spanish Succession , the British captured Port Royal , the capital of the colony , in a siege . The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , which concluded the conflict , ceded the colony to Great Britain while allowing the Acadians to keep their lands . Over the next forty-five years , however , the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain . During the same period , some also participated in various military operations against the British , and maintained supply lines to the French fortresses of Louisbourg and Fort Beaus\u00e9jour . As a result , the British sought to eliminate any future military threat posed by the Acadians and to permanently cut the supply lines they provided to Louisbourg by removing them from the area . Without making distinctions between the Acadians who had been neutral and those who had resisted the occupation of Acadia , the British governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council ordered them to be expelled . [ e ] In the first wave of the expulsion , Acadians were deported to other British North American colonies .",

The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .

These reservoirs are referred to as slack water levels , often just called levels . A canal is also known as a navigation when it parallels a river and shares part of its waters and drainage basin , and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its stretches of slack water levels while staying in its valley . In contrast , a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge , generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation . Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and other water ways crossing far below . Canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination such as a city where water is needed . The Roman Empire 's aqueducts were such water supply canals .",
