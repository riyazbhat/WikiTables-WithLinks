  "/wiki/Armour_Heights_Field": "Armour Heights Field was home to a Royal Flying Corps airfield in Toronto , Ontario , Canada during World War I , and was one of three in the area . Many RFC ( later , Royal Air Force ) pilots trained in Canada due to space availability . The airfield was opened in July 1917 , but closed in 1919 as the war had ended . It was later developed as a residential development and remains as such today . In 1917 , an airfield was constructed near the site of the present Avenue Road and Route 401 interchange , and early the following year , the School of Special Flying opened . Student pilots received instruction on the basics of flight , aerial reconnaissance and aerial combat . However , the school had a short life as it closed around the time the Armistice was signed , on November 11 , 1918 . The airfield had six hangars and a smaller structure housing offices . In 1919 , Bishop-Barker Airplanes Limited , founded by World War I Royal Flying Corps veterans William Billy Bishop and William Barker , took over the aerodrome . This business venture was also short-lived , closing in 1921 , and one of Canada 's busiest airfields at the time was simply abandoned . The site is now the Canadian Forces College , which teaches the Command and Staff courses to officers of all three service branches . The only remnant of the Royal Flying Corps days is the stone building currently housing the Armour Heights Officers Mess , a Tudor-Revival home built in 1914 by George and Moorhouse Architects for Colonel Frederick Burton Robins ( 1866-1948 ) , Honorary Colonel of the Toronto Scottish Regiment and real estate developer .",

It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .

  "/wiki/Burger_King": "Burger King ( BK ) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants . Headquartered in the unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County , Florida , the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King , a Jacksonville , Florida-based restaurant chain . After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954 , its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company and renamed it Burger King . Over the next half-century , the company changed hands four times , with its third set of owners , a partnership of TPG Capital , Bain Capital , and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners , taking it public in 2002 . In late-2010 , 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company , in a deal valued at US $ 3.26 billion . The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes . 3G , along with partner Berkshire Hathaway , eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons , under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International . The 1970s were the Golden Age of the company 's advertising , but beginning in the early-1980s Burger King advertising began losing focus . A series of less successful advertising campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades . In 2003 , Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky ( CP+B ) , which completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character nicknamed The King , accompanied by a new online presence . While highly successful , some of CP+B 's commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity . Burger King 's new owner , 3G Capital , later terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen , to begin a new product-oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting .",
