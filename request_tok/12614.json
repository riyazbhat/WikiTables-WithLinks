Since his retirement , Piquet has been ranked among the greatest Formula One drivers in various motorsport polls . Piquet had a brief career in tennis before losing interest in the sport and subsequently took up karting and hid his identity to prevent his father discovering his hobby . He became the Brazilian national karting champion in 1971-72 and won the Formula Vee championship in 1976 .

Founded in 1960 by two Australians , driver Jack Brabham and designer Ron Tauranac , the team won four Drivers ' and two Constructors ' World Championships in its 30-year Formula One history . Jack Brabham 's 1966 FIA Drivers ' Championship remains the only such achievement using a car bearing the driver 's own name . In the 1960s , Brabham was the world 's largest manufacturer of open-wheel racing cars for sale to customer teams ; by 1970 it had built more than 500 cars . During this period , teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three . Brabham cars also competed in the Indianapolis 500 and in Formula 5000 racing . In the 1970s and 1980s , Brabham introduced such innovations as in-race refuelling , carbon brakes , and hydropneumatic suspension . Its unique Gordon Murray-designed fan car won its only race before being withdrawn . The team won two more Formula One Drivers ' Championships in the 1980s with Brazilian Nelson Piquet . He won his first championship in 1981 in the ground effect BT49-Ford , and became the first to win a Drivers ' Championship with a turbocharged car , in 1983 .

  "/wiki/BMW_in_Formula_One": "BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers ' Championship in 1950 . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s ( often under Formula Two regulations ) , before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s . This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race d\u00e9but in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright . The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009 , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team . Two podium finishes in the first year were followed by a solid third in the Constructors ' Championship in 2007 ( which became second when McLaren was disqualified ) .",

The brand has competed in motor racing as both a constructor and engine supplier sporadically between 1950 and 1987 , and later as a commercial partner since 2015 . The company 's works drivers won the first two World Drivers ' Championships in the pre-war Alfetta : Nino Farina in 1950 ; and Juan Manuel Fangio in 1951 . Following these successes Alfa Romeo withdrew from Formula One . During the 1960s , although the company had no official presence in the top tier of motorsport a number of Formula One teams used independently developed Alfa Romeo engines to power their cars . In the early 1970s , Alfa provided Formula One support for their works driver Andrea de Adamich , supplying adapted versions of their 3-litre V8 engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33/3 sports car to power Adamich 's McLaren ( 1970 ) and March ( 1971 ) entries . None of these engine combinations scored championship points . In the mid-1970s , Alfa engineer Carlo Chiti designed a flat-12 engine to replace the T33 V8 , which achieved some success in taking the 1975 World Sportscar Championship . Bernie Ecclestone , then owner of the Brabham Formula One team , persuaded Alfa Romeo to supply this engine free for the 1976 Formula One season . Although the Brabham-Alfa Romeo 's first season was relatively modest , during the 1977 and 1978 World Championships their cars took 14 podium finishes , including two race victories for Niki Lauda . The company 's sporting department , Autodelta , returned as the works team in 1979 .",
