Architecturally , Rice Stadium is an example of modern architecture , with simple lines and an unadorned , functional design . The lower seating bowl is located below the surrounding ground level .

It is still recognized in many circles as the best stadium in Texas for watching a football game . Entrances and aisles were strategically placed so that the entire stadium could be emptied of spectators in nine minutes . In 2006 , Rice University upgraded the facility by switching from AstroTurf to FieldTurf and adding a modern scoreboard above the north concourse . Seating in the upper deck is in poor condition , which led the university to move home games for which large crowds were expected to nearby NRG Stadium .
