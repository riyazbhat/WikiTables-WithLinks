  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted .",
  "/wiki/Foot_(length)": "The foot ( pl . feet ; abbreviation : ft ; symbol : \u2032 , the prime symbol ) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement . Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959 , one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly . In customary and imperial units , the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard . Historically the foot was a part of many local systems of units , including the Greek , Roman , Chinese , French , and English systems . It varied in length from country to country , from city to city , and sometimes from trade to trade . Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally , but not always , subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits . The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot ( a customary unit of length ) in preference to the meter in its commercial , engineering , and standards activities . The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom ; road signs must use imperial units ( however , distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards , not feet ) , while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height . The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement . The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world . The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 ( UK ) , 14 ( US male ) , 15.5 ( US female ) or 47 ( EU sizing ) .",
  "/wiki/Cities_of_Japan": "A city ( \u5e02 , shi ) is a local administrative unit in Japan . Cities are ranked on the same level as towns ( \u753a , machi ) and villages ( \u6751 , mura ) , with the difference that they are not a component of districts ( \u90e1 , gun ) . Like other contemporary administrative units , they are defined by the Local Autonomy Law of 1947 .",

  "/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo": "Special wards ( \u7279\u5225\u533a , tokubetsu-ku ) are a special form of municipalities in Japan under the 1947 Local Autonomy Law . They are city-level wards : primary subdivisions of a prefecture with municipal autonomy largely comparable to other forms of municipalities . Although the autonomy law today allows for special wards to be established in other prefectures , to date , they only exist in the Tokyo Metropolis which consists of 23 special wards and 39 other , ordinary municipalities ( cities , towns and villages ) . The Special wards of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u7279\u5225\u533a , T\u014dky\u014d tokubetsu-ku ) occupy the land that was Tokyo City in its 1936 borders before it was abolished under the T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet in 1943 to become directly ruled by the prefectural government , then renamed to Metropolitan . During the Occupation of Japan , municipal autonomy was restored to former Tokyo City by the establishment of special wards , each with directly elected mayor and assembly , as in any other city , town or village in Tokyo and the rest of the country . Minority , mostly leftist calls for a restoration of Tokyo City ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02\u5fa9\u6d3b , T\u014dky\u014d-shi fukkatsu ) were not answered . The question of whether special wards actually are municipalities with full local autonomy rights at all remained a political and legal issue for decades . In Japanese , they are collectively also known as Wards area of Tokyo Metropolis ( \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u533a\u90e8 , T\u014dky\u014d-to kubu ) , former Tokyo City ( \u65e7\u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , ky\u016b-T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) , or less formally the 23 wards ( 23\u533a , nij\u016bsan-ku ) or just Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac , T\u014dky\u014d ) if the context makes obvious that this does n't refer to the whole prefecture . Today , all wards refer to themselves as a city in English , but the Japanese designation of special ward ( tokubetsu-ku ) remains unchanged . They are a group of 23 municipalities ; there is no associated single government body separate from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government which governs all 62 municipalities of Tokyo , not only the special wards .",

In 794 , Kyoto ( then known as Heian-ky\u014d ) was chosen as the new seat of Japan 's imperial court . The Emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869 , when the court relocated to Tokyo . The city was devastated during the \u014cnin War in the 15th century and went into an extended period of decline , but gradually revived under the Tokugawa shogunate ( 1600-1868 ) and flourished as a major city in Japan . The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889 . The city was spared from large-scale destruction during World War II and as a result , its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved . Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and a major tourist destination . It is home to numerous Buddhist temples , Shinto shrines , palaces and gardens , many of which are listed collectively by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace , Kiyomizu-dera , Kinkaku-ji , Ginkaku-ji and the Katsura Imperial Villa .

  "/wiki/Hotel_New_Otani_Tokyo": "Construction of the hotel was requested by the Japanese government in the early 1960s , in order to fill a perceived shortage of hotel space for foreign visitors to the upcoming 1964 Summer Olympics . Yonetaro Otani , a former sumo wrestler who founded and ran a small steel company , agreed to build the hotel on a site he owned . It had formerly been the site of the Fushimi-no-miya family residence in the Kioicho district of Tokyo ( and before that , the residence of samurai lord Kat\u014d Kiyomasa ) . The 1,085-room hotel was built in seventeen months using a number of techniques that were revolutionary in Japan at the time , such as curtain walls and prefabricated unit bathrooms . The 400-year-old garden on the site was retained as part of the hotel . The hotel was first announced under a management contract with Sheraton Hotels as the Otani-Sheraton Hotel . However , by the time of its completion , the arrangement was no longer in place , [ a ] and the hotel opened as The New Otani on 1 September 1964 , to coincide with the Olympics the following month . The New Otani was the tallest building in Tokyo from 1964 until 1968 , when the Kasumigaseki Building was completed . It took on an iconic status during this period , particularly for its unique revolving restaurant on the highest floor . During this time , the building was a filming location for the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice , where it appeared as the headquarters of Osato Chemical & Engineering Co Ltd , the Japanese front for Ernst Stavro Blofeld 's SPECTRE organization .
