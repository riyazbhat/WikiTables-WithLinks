They include landscapes , still lifes , portraits and self-portraits , and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic , impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art . He was not commercially successful , and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty . Born into an upper-middle-class family , Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious , quiet , and thoughtful . As a young man he worked as an art dealer , often travelling , but became depressed after he was transferred to London .

In 1886 , he moved to Paris , where he met members of the avant-garde , including \u00c9mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin , who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility .
