  "/wiki/Olympic_medal_table": "The Olympic medal table is a method of sorting the medal placements of countries in the modern-day Olympics and Paralympics . The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) does not officially recognize a ranking of participating countries at the Olympic Games . Nevertheless , the IOC does publish medal tallies for information purposes , showing the total number of Olympic medals earned by athletes representing each country 's respective National Olympic Committee . The convention used by the IOC is to sort by the number of gold medals the athletes from a country have earned . In the event of a tie in the number of gold medals , the number of silver medals is taken into consideration , and then the number of bronze medals . If two countries have an equal number of gold , silver , and bronze medals , they are ordered in the table alphabetically by their IOC country code .",

The lead-up to these games prominently emphasized the return of the Paralympic movement to its spiritual birthplace : in 1948 , the British village of Stoke Mandeville first hosted the Stoke Mandeville Games , an athletics event for disabled British veterans of the Second World War held to coincide with the opening of the Summer Olympics in London .

Organizers expected the Games to be the first Paralympics to achieve mass-market appeal , fuelled by continued enthusiasm from the British public following the country 's successful performance at the Summer Olympics , awareness of the United Kingdom 's role in the history of the Paralympics , public attention surrounding South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius ( who had recently become the first double amputee to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes ) , a major marketing campaign instituted by the Games ' local broadcaster , and growing media coverage of Paralympic sport .
