Formerly known as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition , [ a ] it is informally known in many Catholic countries as the Holy Office ( Latin : Sanctum Officium ) , and between 1908 and 1965 was officially known as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office . Founded by Pope Paul III in 1542 , the congregation 's sole objective is to spread sound Catholic doctrine and defend those points of Christian tradition which seem in danger because of new and unacceptable doctrines . Its headquarters are at the Palace of the Holy Office , just outside Vatican City . The congregation employs an advisory board including cardinals , bishops , priests , lay theologians , and canon lawyers . The current Prefect is Cardinal Luis Ladaria Ferrer , who was appointed by Pope Francis for a five-year term beginning July 2017 . Pope Francis has planned a reorganization of the Curia that will alter the role of this Congregation . A final draft of his apostolic constitution on the Roman Curia , titled Praedicate Evangelium ( Preach the Gospel ) , has been submitted for comment to national bishops conferences and a variety of other bodies . However , it has also been agreed that changes to the Congregation will only reform Catholic missions and not affect Catholic doctrine .",

It was founded by Pope Gregory XV in 1622 to arrange missionary work on behalf of the various religious institutions , and in 1627 Pope Urban VIII established within it a training college for missionaries , the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide . When Pope Paul VI reorganized and adjusted the tasks of the Roman Curia with the publication of Regimini Ecclesiae Universae 15 August 1967 , the name of the congregation was changed to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples .

The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .
