  "/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario": "Kingston is a city in Eastern Ontario , Canada . It is on the eastern end of Lake Ontario , at the beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River ( south end of the Rideau Canal ) . The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 . Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Picturesque": "Picturesque is an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin in Observations on the River Wye , and Several Parts of South Wales , etc . Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty ; made in the Summer of the Year 1770 , a practical book which instructed Englands leisured travellers to examine the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty . Picturesque , along with the aesthetic and cultural strands of Gothic and Celticism , was a part of the emerging Romantic sensibility of the 18th century . The term picturesque needs to be understood in relationship to two other aesthetic ideals : the beautiful and the sublime . By the last third of the 18th century , Enlightenment and rationalist ideas about aesthetics were being challenged by looking at the experiences of beauty and sublimity as non-rational . Aesthetic experience was not just a rational decision - one did not look at a pleasing curved form and decide it was beautiful ; rather it came naturally as a matter of basic human instinct . Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire , while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation . Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime , showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealized states . As Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands : The mountains are ecstatic [ \u2026 ] . None but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror .

  "/wiki/John_A._Macdonald": "Sir John Alexander Macdonald [ a ] ( 11 January 1815 [ b ] - 6 June 1891 ) was the first prime minister of Canada ( 1867-1873 , 1878-1891 ) . The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation , he had a political career which spanned almost half a century . Macdonald was born in Scotland ; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada ( today in eastern Ontario ) . As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston , which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada . By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 . Macdonald 's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion , using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party , promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy , and completing the railway . He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa .",

Her role in Confederation is recognized by the celebration of Victoria Day in Canada . Four other individuals have been labelled as Fathers of Confederation . Hewitt Bernard , who was the recording secretary at the Charlottetown Conference , is considered by some to be a Father of Confederation . The leaders most responsible for bringing three specific provinces into Confederation after 1867 are also referred to as Fathers of Confederation . The provisional government established by Louis Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation in 1870 . The leadership of Amor De Cosmos was instrumental both in bringing democracy to British Columbia and in bringing the province into Confederation in 1871 . The province of Newfoundland entered the Canadian Confederation in 1949 under the leadership of Joey Smallwood , who was then referred to as the only living Father of Confederation .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Canada": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League , and later as the Iroquois Confederacy , and to the English as the Five Nations , comprising the Mohawk , Onondaga , Oneida , Cayuga , and Seneca . After 1722 , they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy , as they were also Iroquoian-speaking , and became known as the Six Nations . The Iroquois have absorbed many other individuals from various peoples into their tribes as a result of warfare , adoption of captives , and by offering shelter to displaced peoples .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Tholobate": "In architecture , a tholobate ( from Greek : \u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 , romanized : tholobates , lit . 'dome pedestal ' ) or drum is the upright part of a building on which a dome is raised . It is generally in the shape of a cylinder or a polygonal prism . In the earlier Byzantine churches , the dome rested direct on the pendentives and the windows were pierced in the dome itself ; in later examples , between the pendentive and the dome an intervening circular wall was built , in which the windows were pierced , and this is the type which was universally employed by the architects of the Renaissance , of whose works the best-known example is St. Peter 's Basilica at Rome . Other examples of churches of this type are St Paul 's Cathedral in London , and the churches of the Les Invalides , the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce , and the Sorbonne in Paris . Secular buildings may also have a tholobate ; the United States Capitol 's dome in Washington , D.C. , is set on a drum , as are numerous American state capitols built on designs inspired by the federal capitol in Washington .

  "/wiki/Dome": "A dome ( from Latin : domus ) is an architectural element that resembles the hollow upper half of a sphere . The precise definition has been a matter of controversy . There are also a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them . A dome can rest upon a rotunda or drum , and can be supported by columns or piers that transition to the dome through squinches or pendentives . A lantern may cover an oculus and may itself have another dome . Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory and they have been constructed from mud , snow , stone , wood , brick , concrete , metal , glass , and plastic over the centuries . The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary , celestial , and governmental traditions that have likewise developed over time . Domes have been found from early Mesopotamia , which may explain the form 's spread . They are found in Persian , Hellenistic , Roman , and Chinese architecture in the Ancient world , as well as among a number of contemporary indigenous building traditions . Dome structures were popular in Byzantine and medieval Islamic architecture , and there are numerous examples from Western Europe in the Middle Ages . The Renaissance architectural style spread from Italy in the Early modern period . Advancements in mathematics , materials , and production techniques since that time resulted in new dome types .",
  "/wiki/Province_of_Canada": "The Province of Canada ( or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas ) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867 . Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton , 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837-1838 . The Act of Union 1840 , passed on 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841 , merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses , a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber . In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837-1838 , unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors . Firstly , Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues , and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements . Secondly , unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats , despite the larger population of Lower Canada . Although Durham 's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for responsible government ( a government accountable to an independent local legislature ) , only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841 . For the first seven years , the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the Queen 's Ministers . Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine-Baldwin ministry in 1849 , when Governor General James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party , effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role . The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867 , when it was divided into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada , while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada ( which had included Labrador until 1809 , when Labrador was transferred to the British colony of Newfoundland ) . Upper Canada was primarily English-speaking , whereas Lower Canada was primarily French-speaking .",

The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate , while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war . The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft , missile boat and fast attack craft . In modern terms , a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons , although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons , which might instead be considered a small frigate . The word corvette is first found in Middle French , a diminutive of the Dutch word corf , meaning a small ship , from the Latin corbis , meaning basket . The rank corvette captain , equivalent in many navies to lieutenant commander , derives from the name of this type of ship . The rank is the most junior of three captain ranks in several European ( e.g. , France , Spain , Italy , Croatia ) and South American ( e.g. , Argentina , Chile ) navies , because a corvette , as the smallest class of rated warship , was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a captain rank .",

The Tower was built in response to the Oregon Crisis , which was a tense dispute over the border between British North America and the United States in the 1840s . The Tower is one of five components of the Kingston Fortifications that defended Kingston Harbour , the Naval Dockyard , military supply depot and the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal . Murney Tower complements the fortifications of Fort Henry , Ontario , Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island , Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada .

Alexander Mackenzie was a foreman on the construction of the Carthcart Tower and later went on to become Canada 's second prime minister 1873-1878 . It was his work crew whose boat capsized while returning from Cedar Island , drowning 17 men . Hamilton Cove was subsequently renamed Deadman 's Bay . Built in 1848 , this limestone tower is 11 m high and 16.5 m in diameter . It is surrounded by a shallow ditch and by a glacis extending to the shorelines on three sides . The guns of Cathcart Tower covered the eastern approaches of Kingston Harbour . The towers ' construction was prompted by a dispute between Great Britain and the United States over the boundary between British Columbia and Oregon that threatened to lead to war ( see Oregon crisis ) .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy_Dockyard": "Royal Navy Dockyards ( more usually termed Royal Dockyards ) were state-owned harbour facilities where ships of the Royal Navy were built , based , repaired and refitted . Throughout its history , the Royal Navy has made extensive use of private shipyards , both at home and abroad ; but at the same time ( from the reign of Henry VII up until the 1990s ) it also had a policy of establishing and maintaining its own dockyard facilities . Portsmouth was the first ( dating from the late 15th century ) ; it was followed by Deptford , Woolwich , Chatham and others . By the 18th century , Britain had a string of these state-owned naval dockyards , located not just around the country but across the world ; each yard was sited close to a safe harbour or anchorage used by the fleet . Most Royal Dockyards had a dual function , providing for both ship building and ship maintenance ( most yards provided for both but some specialised in one or the other ) . Over time , they accrued additional on-site facilities for the support , training and accommodation of naval personnel . For centuries , in this way , the name and concept of a Royal Dockyard was largely synonymous with that of a naval base . In the early 1970s , following the appointment of civilian Dockyard General Managers with cross-departmental authority , and a separation of powers between them and the Dockyard Superintendent ( commanding officer ) , the term 'Naval Base ' began to gain currency as an official designation for the latter 's domain . 'Royal Dockyard ' remained an official designation of the associated shipbuilding/maintenance facilities until 1997 , when the last remaining Royal Dockyards ( Devonport and Rosyth ) were fully privatised .",

  "/wiki/Prison": "A prison , [ a ] also known as a correctional facility , jail , [ b ] gaol ( dated , British and Australian English [ c ] ) , penitentiary ( American English ) , detention center ( or centre if outside the US ) , correctional center , [ d ] ( American English ) or remand center , is a facility in which inmates ( or prisoners ) are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state . Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system : people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment . In simplest terms , a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed . Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes . Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice . In times of war , prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps . In American English , the terms prison and jail have separate definitions , though this is not always followed in casual speech . A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time , such as many years , and is operated by a state or federal government . A jail holds people for shorter periods of time ( e.g . for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and is usually operated by a local government . Outside of North America , prison and jail have the same meaning . Slang terms for a prison include : the pokey , the slammer , the cage , the can , the clink , the joint , the calaboose , the hoosegow , crowbar hotel and the big house .",
  "/wiki/Martello_tower": "Martello towers , sometimes known simply as Martellos , are small defensive forts that were built across the British Empire during the 19th century , from the time of the French Revolutionary Wars onwards . Most were coastal forts . They stand up to 40 feet ( 12 m ) high ( with two floors ) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15-25 men . Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire , while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece , mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse , and hence fire , over a complete 360\u00b0 circle . A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence . The Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century , but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful rifled artillery . Many have survived to the present day , often preserved as historic monuments . In the second half of the 19th century , during the premiership of Lord Palmerston , there was another spate of tower and fort building . The Palmerston Forts are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_architecture": "Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century . Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria ( 1837-1901 ) , called the Victorian era , during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction . However , many elements of what is typically termed Victorian architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria 's reign . The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles . The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch . Within this naming and classification scheme , it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture , and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture .",
  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/Slack_water": "Slack water is a short period in a body of tidal water when the water is completely unstressed , and there is no movement either way in the tidal stream , and which occurs before the direction of the tidal stream reverses . Slack water can be estimated using a tidal atlas or the tidal diamond information on a nautical chart . The time of slack water , particularly in constricted waters , does not occur at high and low water , and in certain areas , such as Primera Angostura , the ebb may run for up to three hours after the water level has started to rise , and the flood may run for three hours after the water has started to fall . Thornton Lecky , writing in 1884 , illustrates the phenomenon with an inland basin of infinite size , connected to the sea by a narrow mouth . Since the level of the basin is always at mean sea level , the flood in the mouth starts at half tide , and its velocity is at its greatest at the time of high water , with the strongest ebb occurring conversely at low water .",

Shoals are also known as sandbanks , sandbars , or gravelbars . Two or more shoals that are either separated by shared troughs or interconnected by past or present sedimentary and hydrographic processes are referred to as a shoal complex . The term shoal is also used in a number of ways that can be either similar or quite different from how it is used in the geologic , geomorphic , and oceanographic literature . Sometimes , this term refers to either any relatively shallow place in a stream , lake , sea , or other body of water ; a rocky area on the sea floor within an area mapped for navigation purposes ; a growth of vegetation on the bottom of a deep lake that occurs at any depth ; and as a verb for the process of proceeding from a greater to a lesser depth of water ."
