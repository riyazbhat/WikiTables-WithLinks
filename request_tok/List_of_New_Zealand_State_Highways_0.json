The inter-island rail ferry service began in August 1962 by the New Zealand Railways Department ( NZR ) . The service primarily provided a RORO rail link between its North and South Island networks , allowing NZR to compete directly with coastal shipping companies for inter-island freight . It also provided the first RORO road link between the two islands , which saw the Wellington to Picton ferries compete with , and then completely replace , the Union Company 's Wellington-Lyttelton ferry service . Today , the Interislander service is still well patronised despite competition on the Wellington-Picton sea route with Bluebridge and from airlines , carrying around one million passengers and 230,000 vehicles per year on 5,500 sailings .

The river flows roughly along the course of an active geologic fault , which continues to the south to become the main instrument responsible for the uplift of the South Island 's Southern Alps . For this reason , the land rises abruptly to the west of the river ; to the east two floodplains have developed . The higher of these is between 15 and 22 km from the mouth of the river . Beyond this , the river is briefly confined by a steep-sided gorge near Taita , before the land opens up into a long triangular plain close to the outflow into Wellington Harbour . The lower valley contains the city of Lower Hutt , administered by Hutt City Council , while the adjacent , larger but less populous city of Upper Hutt has its centre on the smaller plain above the Taita Gorge . The valley forms a major dormitory suburban area for Wellington , and is a location for manufacturing and heavy industry , educational and recreational facilities , and the region 's motor camps . Petone , on the Wellington Harbour shoreline , was proposed as the initial site for the settlement of Wellington by the New Zealand Company . However , as the chosen site was soon seen to be prone to river flooding , early settlement was relocated to Wellington . A small settlement remained at the Petone site as the whole valley was believed to be well suited as farm land .

Like several New Zealand urban areas , it was officially designated a city until an administrative reorganisation in 1989 , and is now run by a District Council . Although the city was called Wanganui from 1854 , in February 2009 , the New Zealand Geographic Board recommended the spelling be changed to Whanganui . In December 2009 , the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable , Crown agencies would use the Whanganui spelling .

The city covers a land area of 395 square kilometres ( 98,000 acres ) . The city 's location was once little more than a clearing in a forest and occupied by small communities of M\u0101ori , who called it Papa-i-Oea , believed to mean How beautiful it is . In the mid-19th century , it was settled by Europeans - originally by Scandinavians and , later , British colonists . On foundation , the British settlement was bestowed the name Palmerston , in honour of Viscount Palmerston , a former British Prime Minister . The suffix North was added in 1871 to distinguish the settlement from Palmerston in the South Island . Today , the name is often informally shortened to Palmy . Early Palmerston North relied on public works and sawmilling . The west coast railway was built in 1886 , linking the town to Wellington , and Palmerston North benefited from a booming pastoral farming industry .",
