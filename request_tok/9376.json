  "/wiki/Command_responsibility": "Command responsibility , sometimes referred to as the Yamashita standard or the Medina standard , and also known as superior responsibility , is the legal doctrine of hierarchical accountability for war crimes . The term may also be used more broadly to refer to the duty to supervise subordinates , and liability for the failure to do so , both in government , military law , and with regard to corporations and trusts . The doctrine of command responsibility was established by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 , partly based on the American Lieber code , a war manual for the Union forces signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 , and was applied for the first time by the German Supreme Court at the Leipzig War Crimes Trials after World War I , in the 1921 trial of Emil M\u00fcller . The United States incorporated the mentioned 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on command responsibility into United States federal law through the precedent set by the United States Supreme Court ( called the Yamashita standard ) in the case of Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita . He was prosecuted in 1945 for atrocities committed by troops under his command in the Philippines , in the Pacific Theater during World War II . Yamashita was charged with unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes . Furthermore , the so-called Medina standard clarified the U.S. law to clearly also encompass U.S. officers , so that those as well as foreign officers such as General Yamashita can be prosecuted in the United States . The Medina standard is based upon the 1971 prosecution of U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in connection with the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War . It holds that a U.S. commanding officer , being aware of a human rights violation or a war crime , will be held criminally liable if he does not take action . However , Medina was acquitted of all charges .",

The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government . An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 Iraqis were killed in the first three to four years of conflict . US troops were officially withdrawn in 2009 but are still fighting in Iraq , most of them having been redeployed following the spread of the Syrian Civil War and the territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . Many former soldiers are employed by defence contractors and private military companies . The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition ; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue . The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration 's War on Terror , following the September 11 attacks . In October 2002 , Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq should he choose to . The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003 , when the U.S. , joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies , launched a shock and awe bombing campaign . Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S.-led forces swept through the country . The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government ; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later . The power vacuum following Saddam 's demise and the mismanagement of the Coalition Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis , as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972 . Westmoreland adopted a strategy of attrition against the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army , attempting to drain them of manpower and supplies . He also made use of the United States ' edge in artillery and air power , both in tactical confrontations and in relentless strategic bombing of North Vietnam . Many of the battles in Vietnam were technically United States victories , with the United States Army in control of the field afterward ; holding territory gained this way proved difficult , however .

By the time he was re-assigned as Army Chief of Staff , United States military forces in Vietnam had reached a peak of 535,000 personnel . Westmoreland 's strategy was ultimately politically unsuccessful . Growing United States casualties and the draft undermined United States support for the war , while large-scale casualties among non-combatants weakened South Vietnamese support . This also failed to weaken North Vietnam 's will to fight , and the Government of South Vietnam - a factor largely out of Westmoreland 's control - never succeeded in establishing enough legitimacy to quell defections to the Viet Cong .",
