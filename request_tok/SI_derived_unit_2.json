  "/wiki/Square_metre": "The square metre ( international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ) or square meter ( American spelling ) is the SI derived unit of area with symbol m2 . Adding and subtracting SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples ; however , as the unit is exponentiated , the quantities grow geometrically by the corresponding power of 10 . For example , a kilometre is 103 ( a thousand ) times the length of a metre , but a square kilometre is 1032 ( 106 , a million ) times the area of a square metre , and a cubic kilometre is 1033 ( 109 , a billion ) cubic metres",
  "/wiki/Area": "Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina , in the plane . Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object . Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape , or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat . It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve ( a one-dimensional concept ) or the volume of a solid ( a three-dimensional concept ) . The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size . In the International System of Units ( SI ) , the standard unit of area is the square metre ( written as m2 ) , which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long . A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares . In mathematics , the unit square is defined to have area one , and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number . There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles , rectangles , and circles . Using these formulas , the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles . For shapes with curved boundary , calculus is usually required to compute the area . Indeed , the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus",
  "/wiki/Cubic_metre": "The cubic metre ( in Commonwealth English and international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ) or cubic meter ( in American English ) is the SI derived unit of volume . Its SI symbol is m3 . It is the volume of a cube with edges one metre in length . An alternative name , which allowed a different usage with metric prefixes , was the st\u00e8re , still sometimes used for dry measure ( for instance , in reference to wood ) . Another alternative name , no longer widely used , was the kilolitre",
  "/wiki/Volume": "Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface , for example , the space that a substance ( solid , liquid , gas , or plasma ) or shape occupies or contains . Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit , the cubic metre . The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container ; i. e. , the amount of fluid ( gas or liquid ) that the container could hold , rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces . Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes . Volumes of some simple shapes , such as regular , straight-edged , and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas . Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape 's boundary . One-dimensional figures ( such as lines ) and two-dimensional shapes ( such as squares ) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space . The volume of a solid ( whether regularly or irregularly shaped ) can be determined by fluid displacement . Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas . The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances . However , sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not additive . In differential geometry , volume is expressed by means of the volume form , and is an important global Riemannian invariant",
  "/wiki/Newton_second": "The newton second ( also newton-second , symbol N s or N\u00b7s ) is the derived SI unit of impulse . It is dimensionally equivalent to the momentum unit kilogram metre per second ( kg\u00b7m/s ) . One newton second corresponds to a one-newton force applied for one second",
  "/wiki/Momentum": "In Newtonian mechanics , linear momentum , translational momentum , or simply momentum ( pl . momenta ) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object . It is a vector quantity , possessing a magnitude and a direction . If m is an object 's mass and v is its velocity ( also a vector quantity ) , then the objects momentum is : p = m v . { \\displaystyle \\mathbf { p } =m\\mathbf { v } . } In SI units , momentum is measured in kilogram meters per second ( kg\u22c5m/s ) . Newton 's second law of motion states that a body 's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it . Momentum depends on the frame of reference , but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity , meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces , its total linear momentum does not change . Momentum is also conserved in special relativity ( with a modified formula ) and , in a modified form , in electrodynamics , quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and general relativity . It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time : translational symmetry . Advanced formulations of classical mechanics , Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics , allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints . In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized momentum , and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above",
  "/wiki/Impulse_(physics)": "In classical mechanics , impulse ( symbolized by J or Imp ) is the integral of a force , F , over the time interval , t , for which it acts . Since force is a vector quantity , impulse is also a vector quantity . Impulse applied to an object produces an equivalent vector change in its linear momentum , also in the same direction . The SI unit of impulse is the newton second ( N\u22c5s ) , and the dimensionally equivalent unit of momentum is the kilogram meter per second ( kg\u22c5m/s ) . The corresponding English engineering units are the pound-second ( lbf\u22c5s ) and the slug-foot per second ( slug\u22c5ft/s ) . A resultant force causes acceleration and a change in the velocity of the body for as long as it acts . A resultant force applied over a longer time therefore produces a bigger change in linear momentum than the same force applied briefly : the change in momentum is equal to the product of the average force and duration . Conversely , a small force applied for a long time produces the same change in momentum - the same impulse - as a larger force applied briefly",
  "/wiki/Angular_momentum": "In physics , angular momentum ( rarely , moment of momentum or rotational momentum ) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum . It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity - the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant . In three dimensions , the angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r \u00d7 p , the cross product of the particle 's position vector r ( relative to some origin ) and its momentum vector ; the latter is p = mv in Newtonian mechanics . This definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids , or physical fields . Unlike momentum , angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen , since the particle 's position is measured from it . Just like for angular velocity , there are two special types of angular momentum : the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum . The spin angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its centre of mass coordinate . The orbital angular momentum of an object about a chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about the origin . The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta . The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital angular velocity vector \u03c9 of the particle , where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin . However , the spin angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity \u03a9 , making the constant of proportionality a second-rank tensor rather than a scalar . Angular momentum is additive ; the total angular momentum of any composite system is the ( pseudo ) vector sum of the angular momenta of its constituent parts",
  "/wiki/Newton_metre": "The newton metre ( also newton-metre , symbol N\u22c5m , N m ) is a unit of torque ( also called moment ) in the SI system . One newton metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long . The nonstandard symbol Nm occurs in some fields . It is also used less commonly as a unit of work , or energy , in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy , the joule . In this usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement in the direction of the force , and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque . This usage is generally discouraged , since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque or a quantity of energy . However , since torque represents energy transferred or expended per angle of revolution , one newton metre of torque is equivalent to one joule per radian . Newton metres and joules are dimensionally equivalent in the sense that they have the same expression in SI base units :",
  "/wiki/Torque": "Torque , moment , moment of force , rotational force or turning effect is the rotational equivalent of linear force . The concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers . Just as a linear force is a push or a pull , a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object . Another definition of torque is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of force from the axis of rotation . The symbol for torque is typically \u03c4 { \\displaystyle { \\boldsymbol { \\tau } } } , the lowercase Greek letter tau . When being referred to as moment of force , it is commonly denoted by M. In three dimensions , the torque is a pseudovector ; for point particles , it is given by the cross product of the position vector ( distance vector ) and the force vector . The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three quantities : the force applied , the lever arm vector connecting the origin to the point of force application , and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors .

As the reciprocal of length , common units used for this measurement include the reciprocal metre or inverse metre ( symbol : m\u22121 ) , the reciprocal centimetre or inverse centimetre ( symbol : cm\u22121 ) , and , in optics , the dioptre . Quantities measured in reciprocal length include :",
  "/wiki/Wavenumber": "In the physical sciences , the wavenumber ( also wave number or repetency ) is the spatial frequency of a wave , measured in cycles per unit distance or radians per unit distance . Whereas temporal frequency can be thought of as the number of waves per unit time , wavenumber is the number of waves per unit distance . In multidimensional systems , the wavenumber is the magnitude of the wave vector . The space of wave vectors is called reciprocal space . Wave numbers and wave vectors play an essential role in optics and the physics of wave scattering , such as X-ray diffraction , neutron diffraction , and elementary particle physics . For quantum mechanical waves , the wavenumber multiplied by the reduced Planck 's constant is the canonical momentum . Wavenumber can be used to specify quantities other than spatial frequency . In optical spectroscopy , it is often used as a unit of temporal frequency assuming a certain speed of light",
  "/wiki/Optical_power": "Optical power ( also referred to as dioptric power , refractive power , focusing power , or convergence power ) is the degree to which a lens , mirror , or other optical system converges or diverges light . It is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length of the device : P = 1/f . High optical power corresponds to short focal length . The SI unit for optical power is the inverse metre ( m\u22121 ) , which is commonly called the dioptre . Converging lenses have positive optical power , while diverging lenses have negative power . When a lens is immersed in a refractive medium , its optical power and focal length change . For two or more thin lenses close together , the optical power of the combined lenses is approximately equal to the sum of the optical powers of each lens : P = P1 + P2 . Similarly , the optical power of a single lens is roughly equal to the sum of the powers of each surface . These approximations are commonly used in optometry . An eye that has too much or too little refractive power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error . A myopic eye has too much power so light is focused in front of the retina . Conversely , a hyperopic eye has too little power so when the eye is relaxed , light is focused behind the retina",
  "/wiki/Curvature": "In mathematics , curvature is any of several strongly related concepts in geometry . Intuitively , the curvature is the amount by which a curve deviates from being a straight line , or a surface deviates from being a plane . For curves , the canonical example is that of a circle , which has a curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius . Smaller circles bend more sharply , and hence have higher curvature . The curvature at a point of a differentiable curve , is the curvature of its osculating circle , that is the circle that best approximates the curve near this point . The curvature of a straight line is zero . The curvature of a curve at a point is normally a scalar quantity , that is , it is expressed by a single real number . For surfaces ( and , more generally for higher-dimensional manifolds ) , that are embedded in a Euclidean space , the concept of curvature is more complex , as depending on the choice of a direction on the surface or manifold . This leads to the concepts of maximal curvature , minimal curvature , and mean curvature . For Riemannian manifolds ( of dimension at least two ) that are not necessarily embedded in a Euclidean space , one can define the curvature intrinsically , that is without referring to an external space . See Curvature of Riemannian manifolds for the definition , which is done in terms of lengths of curves traced on the manifold , and expressed , using linear algebra , by the Riemann curvature tensor",

The spatial frequency is a measure of how often sinusoidal components ( as determined by the Fourier transform ) of the structure repeat per unit of distance . The SI unit of spatial frequency is cycles per meter . In image-processing applications , spatial frequency is often expressed in units of cycles per millimeter or equivalently line pairs per millimeter . In wave mechanics , the spatial frequency is commonly denoted by \u03be { \\displaystyle \\xi } or sometimes \u03bd { \\displaystyle \\nu } , although the latter is also used to represent temporal frequency .

  "/wiki/Specific_energy": "Specific energy or massic energy is energy per unit mass .

It may also be used for the kinetic energy or potential energy of a body . Specific energy is an intensive property , whereas energy and mass are extensive properties . The SI unit for specific energy is the joule per kilogram ( J/kg ) . Other units still in use in some contexts are the kilocalorie per gram ( Cal/g or kcal/g ) , mostly in food-related topics , watt hours per kilogram in the field of batteries , and the Imperial unit BTU per pound ( Btu/lb ) , in some engineering and applied technical fields .

  "/wiki/Energy_density": "Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or region of space per unit volume . Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit mass , though the accurate term for this is specific energy . Often only the useful or extractable energy is measured , which is to say that inaccessible energy ( such as rest mass energy ) is ignored . In cosmological and other general relativistic contexts , however , the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the stress-energy tensor and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph . Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as pressure , and in many circumstances is a synonym : for example , the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as ( and behaves as ) a physical pressure , and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume . In short , pressure is a measure of the enthalpy per unit volume of a system . A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached",
  "/wiki/Surface_tension": "Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces to shrink into the minimum surface area possible . Surface tension allows insects ( e.g . water striders ) , usually denser than water , to float and slide on a water surface . At liquid-air interfaces , surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other ( due to cohesion ) than to the molecules in the air ( due to adhesion ) . The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane . Thus , the surface comes under tension from the imbalanced forces , which is probably where the term surface tension came from . Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules to each other through a web of hydrogen bonds , water has a higher surface tension ( 72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 \u00b0C ) than most other liquids . Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity . Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length , or of energy per unit area . The two are equivalent , but when referring to energy per unit of area , it is common to use the term surface energy , which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids . In materials science , surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface energy",

  "/wiki/Diffusion": "Diffusion is the net movement of anything ( for example , atom , ions , molecules ) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration . Diffusion is driven by a gradient in concentration . The concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields , including physics ( particle diffusion ) , chemistry , biology , sociology , economics , and finance ( diffusion of people , ideas , and price values ) . The central idea of diffusion , however , is common to all of these : an object ( for example , atom , idea , etc . ) undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object . A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity , for example , concentration , pressure , or temperature with the change in another variable , usually distance . A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient , a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient , and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient . The word diffusion derives from the Latin word , diffundere , which means to spread out . A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle random walk , and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion . Bulk motion , or bulk flow , is the characteristic of advection . The term convection is used to describe the combination of both transport phenomena .
