  "/wiki/Information_technology": "Information technology ( IT ) is the use of computers to store , retrieve , transmit , and manipulate data or information . IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies . IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ( ICT ) . An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs . The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones . Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology , including computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , and e-commerce . [ a ] Based on the storage and processing technologies employed , it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development : pre-mechanical ( 3000 BC - 1450 AD ) , mechanical ( 1450-1840 ) , electromechanical ( 1840-1940 ) , and electronic ( 1940-present ) . This article focuses on the most recent period ( electronic ) .",

  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",
  "/wiki/Uranium": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable ; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 % of uranium on Earth ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite . In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739-99.2752 % ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198-0.7202 % ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050-0.0059 % ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

Financial services companies are present in all economically developed geographic locations and tend to cluster in local , national , regional and international financial centers such as London , New York City , and Tokyo .",
  "/wiki/Debentures": "In corporate finance , a debenture is a medium- to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money , at a fixed rate of interest . The legal term debenture originally referred to a document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it , but in some countries the term is now used interchangeably with bond , loan stock or note . A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing the fact that the company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest . Although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company 's capital structure , it does not become share capital . Senior debentures get paid before subordinate debentures , and there are varying rates of risk and payoff for these categories . Debentures are freely transferable by the debenture holder . Debenture holders have no rights to vote in the company 's general meetings of shareholders , but they may have separate meetings or votes e.g . on changes to the rights attached to the debentures . The interest paid to them is a charge against profit in the company 's financial statements . The term debenture is more descriptive than definitive . An exact and all-encompassing definition for a debenture has proved elusive . The English commercial judge , Lord Lindley , notably remarked in one case : Now , what the correct meaning of debenture is I do not know .",

  "/wiki/Trade": "Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another , often in exchange for money . Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market . An early form of trade , barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services . [ need quotation to verify ] Barter involves trading things without the use of money . When either bartering party started to involve precious metals , these gained symbolic as well as practical importance . [ citation needed ] Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange , such as money . As a result , buying can be separated from selling , or earning . The invention of money ( and later of credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade . Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade . In one modern view , trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production , but use their output in trades for other products and needs . Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage ( perceived or real ) in the production of some trade-able commodity - including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere . For example : different regions ' sizes may encourage mass production .",
  "/wiki/Fashion": "Fashion is a popular aesthetic expression at a certain time and in a certain context , especially in clothing , footwear , lifestyle , accessories , makeup , hairstyle and body proportions . Whereas a trend often connotes a very specific aesthetic expression , and often lasting shorter than a season , fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections . Style is an expression that lasts over many seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers , symbols , class and culture ( ex . Baroque , Rococo , etc. ) . According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu , fashion connotes the latest fashion , the latest difference . Even though they are often used together , the term fashion differs from clothes and costume , where the first describes the material and technical garment , whereas the second has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear . Fashion instead describes the social and temporal system that activates dress as a social signifier in a certain time and context . Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the current intensity of the qualitative moment , to the temporal aspect the Greek called kairos , whereas clothes belong to the quantitative , to what the Greek called chronos . Exclusive brands aspire for the label haute couture , but the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris . With increasing mass-production of consumer commodities at cheaper prices , and with global reach , sustainability has become an urgent issue amongst politicians , brands and consumers .",
  "/wiki/Jewelry": "Jewellery or jewelry ( American English ; see spelling differences ) consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment , such as brooches , rings , necklaces , earrings , pendants , bracelets , and cufflinks . Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes . From a western perspective , the term is restricted to durable ornaments , excluding flowers for example . For many centuries metal , often combined with gemstones , has been the normal material for jewellery , but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used . It is one of the oldest type of archaeological artefact - with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery . The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived ; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times , while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle , important in other cultures , are much less common . Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials . Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral , precious metals , beads , and shells have been widely used , and enamel has often been important . In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol , for its material properties , its patterns , or for meaningful symbols . Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part , from hairpins to toe rings , and even genital jewellery . The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes , and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures , but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery ; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture . The word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel , which was anglicised from the Old French jouel , and beyond that , to the Latin word jocale , meaning plaything .",

  "/wiki/Apparel": "Clothing ( also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is items worn on the body . Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together . The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies . The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing . In most parts of the world , not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .",
  "/wiki/Retail": "Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit . Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain . The term retailer is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals , who are end-users , rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale , corporate or government clientele . Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products . Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods , including necessities such as food and clothing ; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity . Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing : it does not always result in a purchase . Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history , dating back to antiquity . Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers . Over the centuries , retail shops were transformed from little more than rude booths to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era . Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store , the market to be served , the optimal product assortment , customer service , supporting services and the store 's overall market positioning . Once the strategic retail plan is in place , retailers devise the retail mix which includes product , price , place , promotion , personnel , and presentation . In the digital age , an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels , including both bricks and mortar and online retailing .",
