It lies in the South Caucasus on the eastern coast of the Black Sea , south of the Greater Caucasus mountains in northwestern Georgia . It covers 8,660 square kilometres ( 3,340 sq mi ) and has a population of around 240,000 . Its capital is Sukhumi . The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Georgia-Russia relations . The polity is recognised as a state by Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru and Syria . While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia , the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia legally part of Georgia , whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia . The region had autonomy within Soviet Georgia at the time when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s . Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz - the region 's titular ethnicity - and Georgians - the largest single ethnic group at that time - culminated in the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia which resulted in Georgia 's loss of control of most of Abkhazia , the de facto independence of Abkhazia , and the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia . Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations , the dispute remains unresolved . The long-term presence of a United Nations Observer Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force failed to prevent the flare-up of violence on several occasions . In August 2008 , Abkhaz and Russian forces fought a war against Georgian forces , which led to the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia , the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement , and the termination of the UN mission .",

In a broader sense , one can view the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict as part of a geopolitical conflict in the Caucasus region , intensified at the end of the 20th century with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The conflict , one of the bloodiest in the post-Soviet area , remains unresolved . The Georgian government has offered substantial autonomy to Abkhazia several times . However , both the Abkhaz government and the opposition in Abkhazia refuse any form of union with Georgia . Abkhaz regard their independence as the result of a war of liberation from Georgia , while Georgians believe that historically Abkhazia has always formed part of Georgia . Georgians formed the single largest ethnic group in pre-war Abkhazia , with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989 but as of 2014 [ update ] most Georgians left in Abkhazia want to remain independent of Georgia . During the war the Abkhaz separatist side carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign which resulted in the expulsion of up to 250,000 ethnic Georgians and in the killing of from 4,000 to 15,000 . The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) conventions of Lisbon , Budapest and Istanbul have officially recognized the ethnic cleansing of Georgians , which UN General Assembly Resolution GA/10708 also mentions . The UN Security Council has passed a series of resolutions in which it appeals for a cease-fire .",

  "/wiki/Cyprus_dispute": "The Cyprus dispute , also known as the Cyprus conflict , Cyprus issue , or Cyprus problem , is an ongoing dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots . Initially , with the occupation of the island by the British Empire from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and subsequent annexation in 1914 , the Cyprus dispute was identified as the conflict between the people of Cyprus and the British Crown regarding the Cypriots ' demand for self-determination . The British administration shifted the dispute from a colonial dispute to an ethnic dispute between the Turkish and Greek islanders . The international complications of the dispute stretch beyond the boundaries of the island of Cyprus itself and involve the guarantor powers under the Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement ( Turkey , Greece , and the United Kingdom ) , the United Nations and the European Union , along with ( unofficially ) the United States . It entered its current phase in the aftermath of the 1974 Turkish military invasion and occupation of the northern third of Cyprus . Only Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , while there is broad recognition that the ongoing military presence constitutes occupation of territories that belong to the Republic of Cyprus . According to the European Court of Human Rights , the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be considered a puppet state under effective Turkish control . Although the Republic of Cyprus is recognized by the international community as the sole legitimate state , the north is under the de facto administration of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , on which the Turkish Armed Forces are stationed . The 1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat , initiated by the Greek military junta , was followed five days later by Turkey 's invasion , leading to the occupation of the northern part of the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus . In 1983 , the Turkish Cypriot community unilaterally declared independence , forming the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , a sovereign entity that lacks international recognition with the exception of Turkey , with which Northern Cyprus enjoys full diplomatic relations , in violation of Resolution 550 , adopted on 11 May 1984 by the United Nations Security Council . As a result of the two communities and the guarantor countries committing themselves to finding a peaceful solution to the dispute , the United Nations maintains a buffer zone ( known as the Green Line ) to avoid any further intercommunal tensions and hostilities .

Recognised only by Turkey , Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus . Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay , Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point , the Kokkina exclave in the west . Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina . A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia , the island 's largest city and capital of both sides . A coup d'\u00e9tat in 1974 , performed as part of an attempt to annex the island to Greece , prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . This resulted in the eviction of much of the north 's Greek Cypriot population , the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south , and the partitioning of the island , leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983 . Due to its lack of recognition , Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic , political and military support . Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful . The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus .

As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

The capital city is Chi\u0219in\u0103u . Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812 , when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire ( to which Moldavia was a vassal state ) and became known as Bessarabia . In 1856 , southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia , which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania , but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878 . During the 1917 Russian Revolution , Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic , known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic . In February 1918 , the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly . The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia , which in 1924 established , within the Ukrainian SSR , a Moldavian autonomous republic ( MASSR ) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia . In 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union , leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Moldavian SSR ) , which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR ( east of the Dniester River ) .

Its capital is Tiraspol . Transnistria has been recognised only by three other mostly non-recognised states : Abkhazia , Artsakh , and South Ossetia . Transnistria is designated by the Republic of Moldova as the Transnistria autonomous territorial unit with special legal status ( Romanian : Unitatea teritorial\u0103 autonom\u0103 cu statut juridic special Transnistria ) , or St\u00eenga Nistrului ( Left Bank of the Dniester ) . After the dissolution of the USSR , tensions between Moldova and the breakaway Transnistrian territory escalated into a military conflict that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a ceasefire in July of the same year . As part of that agreement , a three-party ( Russia , Moldova , Transnistria ) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the demilitarised zone , comprising twenty localities on both sides of the river . Although the ceasefire has held , the territory 's political status remains unresolved : Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent semi-presidential republic with its own government , parliament , military , police , postal system , currency and vehicle registration . Its authorities have adopted a constitution , flag , national anthem and coat of arms . It is the only country still using the hammer and sickle on its flag , despite not being a communist state . After a 2005 agreement between Moldova and Ukraine , all Transnistrian companies that seek to export goods through the Ukrainian border must be registered with the Moldovan authorities . This agreement was implemented after the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine ( EUBAM ) took force in 2005 .

The region was the core of the Serbian medieval state , which has also been the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century , when its status was upgraded to a patriarchate . Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire from the 15th to the early 20th century .",
  "/wiki/2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence": "The 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence was adopted on 17 February 2008 by the Assembly of Kosovo . In a meeting attended by 109 of the total 120 members , the assembly unanimously declared Kosovo to be independent from Serbia , while all 11 representatives of the Serb minority boycotted the proceedings . This minority was found to be common in the northern District of Mitrovica , bordering Serbia . It was the second declaration of independence by Kosovo 's Albanian-majority political institutions ; the first was proclaimed on 7 September 1990 . The legality of the declaration has been disputed . Serbia sought international validation and support for its stance that the declaration was illegal , and in October 2008 requested an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice . The Court determined that the declaration did not violate international law . As a result of the ICJ decision , a joint Serbia-EU resolution was passed in the United Nations General Assembly which called for an EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia to promote cooperation , achieve progress on the path to the European Union and improve the lives of the people . The dialogue resulted in the 2013 Brussels deal between Serbia and Kosovo which abolished all of the Republic of Serbia 's institutions in Kosovo . Dejan Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 is the official representative of Serbia to Kosovo . Valdet Sadiku is the official representative of Kosovo to Serbia .",

The territory was previously an autonomous province of Serbia during Socialist Yugoslavia ( 1946-1990 ) , and acquired its current status in 1990 . The province was governed as part of Serbia until the Kosovo War ( 1998-99 ) , when it became a United Nations ( UN ) protectorate in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , but still internationally recognized as part of Serbia . The control was then transferred to the UN administration of UNMIK . In 2008 , Kosovo authorities unilaterally declared independence , which is recognized by 98 UN members , but not by Serbia which still regards it as its province .",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members . Juche , an ideology of national self-reliance , was introduced into the constitution in 1972 .",

  "/wiki/Sixty-Four_Villages_East_of_the_Heilongjiang_River": "In the summer of 1857 , the Russian Empire offered monetary compensation to China 's Qing dynasty government if they would remove the native inhabitants from the area ; however , their offer was rebuffed . The following year , in the 1858 Treaty of Aigun , the Qing ceded the north bank of the Amur to Russia . However , Qing subjects residing north of the Amur River were permitted to retain their domiciles in perpetuity under the authority of the Manchu government . The earliest known Russian estimate ( 1859 ) gives the population of Qing subjects in the Trans-Zeya District as 3,000 , without breakdown by ethnicity ; the next one ( 1870 ) gives it as 10,646 , including 5,400 ( Han ) Chinese , 4,500 Manchus and 1,000 Daurs . The estimates published between the late 1870s and early 1890s varied between 12,000 and 16,000 , peaking in 1894 , at 16,102 ( including 9,119 Han Chinese , 5,783 Manchus , and 1,200 Daurs ) . After that , reported numbers went down ( 7,000 to 7,500 residents reported each year from 1895 to 1899 ) ; by that time , however , the Trans-Zeya villagers constituted only a minority of the Chinese present in the region . For example , besides the Trans-Zeya villagers , in 1898 statistics reported 12,199 Chinese otkhodniki ( migrant workers ) and 5,400 Chinese miners in the Amur Oblast as it existed at the time , as well as 4,008 Chinese urban residents in Blagoveshchensk and probably elsewhere . During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 , Qing forces attempted to blockade Russian boat traffic on the Amur near Aigun , starting from 16 July , and attacked Blagoveshchensk along with Chinese Honghuzi bandits . In response to these attacks the military governor of the Amur region , Lieutenant-General Konstantin Nikolaevich Gribskii , ordered the expulsion of all Qing subjects who remained north of the river . This included the residents of the villages , and Chinese traders and workers who lived in Blagoveshchensk proper , where they numbered anywhere between one-sixth and one-half of the local population of 30,000 . They were taken by the local police and driven into the river to be drowned . Those who could swim were shot by the Russian forces ."
