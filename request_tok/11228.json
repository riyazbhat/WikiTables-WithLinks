  "/wiki/Rent_(musical)": "Rent is a rock musical with music , lyrics , and book by Jonathan Larson , loosely based on Giacomo Puccini 's opera La Boh\u00e8me . It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in Lower Manhattan 's East Village in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City , under the shadow of HIV/AIDS . The musical was first seen in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1993 . This same Off-Broadway theatre was also the musical 's initial home following its official 1996 opening . The show 's creator , Jonathan Larson , died suddenly of an aortic dissection , believed to have been caused by undiagnosed Marfan syndrome , the night before the Off-Broadway premiere . The musical moved to Broadway 's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29 , 1996 . On Broadway , Rent gained critical acclaim and won several awards , including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Musical . The Broadway production closed on September 7 , 2008 , after 12 years , making it one of the longest-running shows on Broadway . The production grossed over $ 280 million . The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions . In 2005 , it was adapted into a motion picture featuring most of the original cast members .",
  "/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet": "Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families . It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays . Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers . Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity . The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 . Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris . Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 . The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality , however , and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare 's original . Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill . The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops . Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play . Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical , and opera venues .",
  "/wiki/Romeo": "Romeo Montague is the main protagonist of William Shakespeare 's tragedy , The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet . The son of Lord Montague and his wife , Lady Montague , he secretly loves and marries Juliet , a member of the rival House of Capulet , through a priest named Friar Laurence . Forced into exile after slaying Juliet 's cousin , Tybalt , in a duel , Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet 's death . The character 's origins can be traced as far back as Pyramus , who appears in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , but the first modern incarnation of Romeo is Mariotto in the 33rd of Masuccio Salernitano 's Il Novellino ( 1476 ) . This story was reworked in 1524 by Luigi da Porto as Giulietta e Romeo ( published posthumously in 1531 ) . Da Porto named the character Romeo Montecchi and his storyline is near-identical to Shakespeare 's adaptation . Since no 16th-century direct English translation of Giulietta e Romeo is known , Shakespeare 's main source is thought to be Arthur Brooke 's English verse translation of a French translation of a 1554 adaptation by Matteo Bandello . Although both Salernitano and da Porto claimed that their stories had historical basis , there is little evidence that this is the case . Romeo , an only child like Juliet , is one of the most important characters of the play , and has a consistent presence throughout it . His role as an idealistic lover has led the word Romeo to become a synonym for a passionate male lover in various languages . Although often treated as such , it is not clear that Montague is a surname in the modern sense .",

  "/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald": "Lee Harvey Oswald ( October 18 , 1939 - November 24 , 1963 ) was an American Marxist and former U.S. Marine who assassinated United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 . Oswald was honorably released from active duty in the Marine Corps into the reserve and defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959 . He lived in Minsk until June 1962 , when he returned to the United States with his Russian wife , Marina , and eventually settled in Dallas . Five government investigations [ n 1 ] concluded that Oswald shot and killed Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas . About 45 minutes after assassinating Kennedy , Oswald shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit on a local street . He then slipped into a movie theater , where he was arrested for Tippit 's murder . Oswald was eventually charged with the assassination of Kennedy ; he denied the accusations and stated that he was a patsy . Two days later , Oswald was fatally shot by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby on live television in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters . In September 1964 , the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone when he assassinated Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas School Book Depository . This conclusion , though controversial , was supported by previous investigations from the FBI , the Secret Service , and the Dallas Police Department . Despite forensic , ballistic , and eyewitness evidence supporting the official findings , public opinion polls have shown that most Americans do not believe the official version of the events . The assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories .",

Born in Salzburg , Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood . Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty . At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years .",
