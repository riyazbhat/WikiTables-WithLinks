They are also of unhewn chestnut logs , concrete chinking , brick chimneys , and asphalt shingles . The Nancy Lincoln Inn and its cabins were built to serve the many visitors who wished to visit the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln . The increase in tourism during the 1920s was due to the ease of transportation that newly paved roads for automobiles provided . Jim Howell was the original operator of the inn , from 1928 to 1946 ; his descendants have operated it ever since . The inn rented out the cabins and served food until World War II ; the cabins would once again be rented out after they were restored by their owners Carl and Sharon Howell , Jr. in 2005 , with air conditioning added . However , guests have to use an outside modern bathhouse due to a lack of indoor plumbing . In 1934 , the National Park Service in its evaluation called the inn an unacceptable adjacent commercialization , and red cedar trees were planted to obstruct the view of the inn to the memorial log cabin temple .",
