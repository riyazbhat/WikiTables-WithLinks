  "/wiki/Upper_Peninsula": "The Upper Peninsula ( UP ) , also known as Upper Michigan , is the northern of the two major peninsulas that make up the U.S. state of Michigan . The peninsula is bounded on the north by Lake Superior , on the east by the St. Marys River , and on the south by Lake Michigan , the Straits of Mackinac , and Lake Huron . Topographically , the base of the Upper Peninsula as a geologic feature lies in northeastern Wisconsin between the base of the Door Peninsula and Superior Bay ; but in political geography , because most of the peninsula is within the boundaries of Michigan , it is measured eastward from the Porcupine Mountains , from the Wisconsin-Michigan boundary along and between the Montreal and Menominee rivers . Michigan 's Upper Peninsula is bounded on land by Wisconsin to the southwest and west ; and in territorial waters by Minnesota to the west , Ontario to the west , north and east , and the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin extends into Lake Michigan east of the western Upper Peninsula . Five Michigan Upper Peninsula counties include nearby major islands : Mackinac Island , Round Island and Bois Blanc Island in Lake Huron are in Mackinac County ; Sugar Island and Neebish Island in the St. Marys River , and Drummond Island in Lake Huron are in Chippewa County ; Grand Island is in Alger County ; Summer Island is Delta County ; and Isle Royale is part of Keweenaw County . The Upper Peninsula contains 29% of the land area of Michigan but just 3% of its total population . Residents are frequently called Yoopers ( derived from UP-ers ) and have a strong regional identity . Large numbers of French Canadian , Finnish , Swedish , Cornish , and Italian immigrants came to the Upper Peninsula , especially the Keweenaw Peninsula , to work in the area 's mines and lumber industry .

Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line , he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle-class Americans could afford . In doing so , Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century . His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry . As the owner of the Ford Motor Company , he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world . He is credited with Fordism : mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers . Ford had a global vision , with consumerism as the key to peace . His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations , including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents . Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to control the company permanently . Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I , and for promoting antisemitic content , including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent and the book The International Jew , having an alleged influence on the development of Nazism and Adolf Hitler .",

  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",
