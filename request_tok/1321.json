  "/wiki/Blast_furnace": "A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals , generally pig iron , but also others such as lead or copper . Blast refers to the combustion air being forced or supplied above atmospheric pressure . In a blast furnace , fuel ( coke ) , ores , and flux ( limestone ) are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace , while a hot blast of air ( sometimes with oxygen enrichment ) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres , so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward . The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom , and waste gases ( flue gas ) exiting from the top of the furnace . The downward flow of the ore along with the flux in contact with an upflow of hot , carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process . In contrast , air furnaces ( such as reverberatory furnaces ) are naturally aspirated , usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue . According to this broad definition , bloomeries for iron , blowing houses for tin , and smelt mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces . However , the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron , an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel , and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting .",

A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians .
