  "/wiki/NWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship": "The NWA World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship created by the National Wrestling Alliance . From 1948 to 1982 , the NWA allowed member promotions to create their own territorial version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship without oversight from the board of directors . The first of these NWA World Tag Team Championships was created in 1950 in the San Francisco territory , which while billed as a World title was essentially restricted to the specific NWA territory . In 1957 as many as 13 versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship were confirmed to be in existence . In 1982 Big Time Wrestling , based in Los Angeles , closed and abandoned their version of the championship . This meant that only the Jim Crockett Promotions ' NWA World Tag Team Championship was active , but still being controlled by JCP , not the NWA board of directors . In 1991 that championship was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship . In 1992 the NWA board of directors decided to sanction one world-level NWA World Tag Team Championship , working with WCW to hold a tournament to determine the inaugural officially recognized , NWA World Tag Team Championship . In 1993 , the NWA and WCW severed their relationship and the NWA took with it the tag team championship . The NWA would briefly allow the World Wrestling Federation to control the championship in 1998 but by 1999 that collaboration ended . In 2002 the NWA gave control of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the newly formed NWA Total Nonstop Action ( NWA-TNA ) promotion .

The group operated a territory system which sanctioned various championships , recognized one world champion , participated in talent exchanges , and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions .

It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the World Wrestling Federation 's national expansion . In September 1993 , the largest remaining member promotion , World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , left the NWA for the second and final time . The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions , with NWA : Total Nonstop Action ( NWA : TNA ) given exclusivity over its World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships from June 2002 to May 2007 .

In 1999 , Giant Baba died and the promotion was ran by Motoko Baba . Misawa was named President but left in 2000 after disagreements with Motoko . Misawa created Pro Wrestling NOAH and every single native wrestler besides Masanobu Fuchi and Toshiaki Kawada left All Japan .
