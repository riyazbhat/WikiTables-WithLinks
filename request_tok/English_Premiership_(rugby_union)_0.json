ACL was owned jointly by Coventry City Council and the Higgs Charity . The stadium hosted its first football match in August 2005 . The official opening was performed by Dame Kelly Holmes and sports minister Richard Caborn on 24 February 2007 , by which time the arena had already hosted a sell-out England U21 football match against Germany as well as a full season of Coventry City matches .
