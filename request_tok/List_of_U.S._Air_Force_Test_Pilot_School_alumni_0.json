Astronaut Jim McDivitt 's crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit , became the crew for the Apollo 9 mission , and Borman 's crew were moved to the Apollo 8 mission .

The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program , after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff . During the launch of STS-107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches , causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . Before re-entry , NASA managers had limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . After the disaster , Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years , as they had been after the Challenger disaster . Construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was put on hold ; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Space Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121 . NASA ultimately made several technical and organizational changes , including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle 's thermal protection system had endured the ascent , and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found . Except for one final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry",

He was a test pilot and major general in the US Air Force Reserves . Selected as part of NASA 's third group of fourteen astronauts in 1963 , Collins flew in space twice . His first spaceflight was on Gemini 10 in 1966 , in which he and Command Pilot John Young performed orbital rendezvous with two different spacecraft and undertook two extravehicular activities ( EVAs , also known as spacewalks ) . On the 1969 Apollo 11 mission he became one of 24 people to fly to the Moon , which he orbited thirty times .

After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 .
