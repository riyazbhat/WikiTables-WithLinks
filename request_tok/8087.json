  "/wiki/Whitehall": "Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster , Central London , which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea . It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square . The street is recognised as the centre of the Government of the United Kingdom and is lined with numerous departments and ministries , including the Ministry of Defence , Horse Guards and the Cabinet Office . Consequently , the name 'Whitehall ' is used as a metonym for the British civil service and government , and as the geographic name for the surrounding area . The name was taken from the Palace of Whitehall that was the residence of Kings Henry VIII through to William III , before its destruction by fire in 1698 ; only the Banqueting House survived . Whitehall was originally a wide road that led to the front of the palace ; the route to the south was widened in the 18th century following the destruction of the palace . As well as government buildings , the street is known for its memorial statues and monuments , including Britain 's primary war memorial , the Cenotaph . The Whitehall Theatre , now the Trafalgar Studios , has been popular for farce comedies since the mid-20th century .",
  "/wiki/Buckingham_Palace": "Buckingham Palace ( UK : /\u02c8b\u028ck\u026a\u014b\u0259m/ ) is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom . [ a ] Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality . It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning . Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen 's House . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 . The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East Front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection . The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House .",
  "/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament": "The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords , the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) . Part of the New Palace 's area of 3.24 hectares ( 8 acres ) was reclaimed from the River Thames , which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long ( 980 ft ) fa\u00e7ade , called the River Front . Augustus Pugin , a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style , assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace .",

Many sites commonly associated with London are in the borough , including St James 's Palace , Buckingham Palace , the Palace of Westminster ( Houses of Parliament ) and 10 Downing Street . The borough is divided into a number of localities including the ancient political district of Westminster ; the shopping areas around Oxford Street , Regent Street , Piccadilly and Bond Street ; and the night-time entertainment district of Soho . Much of the borough is residential , and in 2008 it was estimated to have a population of 236,000 . The local government body is Westminster City Council . A study in 2017 by Trust for London and The New Policy Institute found that Westminster has the third-highest pay inequality of the 32 London boroughs .

The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry . The building of both bridges was problematic , with both the first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects . The original bridge , the first iron bridge over the Thames , was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879 . The second bridge , which took eight years to build , was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane . In 1963 it was proposed to replace the bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops , office space , hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river , but the plans were abandoned because of costs . With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade , the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907 .
