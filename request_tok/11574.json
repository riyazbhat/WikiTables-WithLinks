  "/wiki/Cibeles": "Cybele ( /\u02c8s\u026ab\u0259li/ SIB-\u0259-lee ; Phrygian : Matar Kubileya/Kubeleya Kubileya/Kubeleya Mother , perhaps Mountain Mother ; Lydian Kuvava ; Greek : \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 Kybele , \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ae\u03b2\u03b7 Kybebe , \u039a\u03cd\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Kybelis ) is an Anatolian mother goddess ; she may have a possible forerunner in the earliest neolithic at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck , where statues of plump women , sometimes sitting , have been found in excavations . She is Phrygia 's only known goddess , and was probably its national deity . Her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies around the 6th century BC . In Greece , Cybele met with a mixed reception . She was partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess Gaia , her possibly Minoan equivalent Rhea , and the harvest-mother goddess Demeter . Some city-states , notably Athens , evoked her as a protector , but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign , exotic mystery-goddess who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music , wine , and a disorderly , ecstatic following . Uniquely in Greek religion , she had a eunuch mendicant priesthood . Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine Phrygian castrate shepherd-consort Attis , who was probably a Greek invention . In Greece , Cybele is associated with mountains , town and city walls , fertile nature , and wild animals , especially lions . In Rome , Cybele was known as Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) . The Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline oracle recommended her conscription as a key religious ally in Rome 's second war against Carthage . Roman mythographers reinvented her as a Trojan goddess , and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas .",
