  "/wiki/SSRI": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) are a class of drugs that are typically used as antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders . SSRIs function by increasing the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption ( reuptake ) into the presynaptic cell , increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor . They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters , with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters . SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries . The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression has been disputed and may be outweighed by side effects .",

  "/wiki/Serotonin\u2013norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor": "Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) are a class of antidepressant drugs that treat major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , anxiety disorders , obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , social phobia , attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , chronic neuropathic pain , fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , and menopausal symptoms . SNRIs are monoamine reuptake inhibitors ; specifically , they inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine . These neurotransmitters are thought to play an important role in mood regulation . SNRIs can be contrasted with the more widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , which act upon serotonin only . The human serotonin transporter ( SERT ) and norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) are membrane transport proteins that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic nerve terminal . Dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake can offer advantages over other antidepressant drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms . They can be especially useful in concomitant chronic or neuropathic pain . SNRIs , along with SSRIs and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( NRIs ) , are second-generation antidepressants . Over the past two decades , second-generation antidepressants have simply replaced first-generation antidepressants , such as tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , as the drugs of choice for the treatment of MDD due to their improved tolerability and safety profile .",

Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries . Common side effects include dry mouth , trouble sleeping , agitation , and headaches .

It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe . Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant .
