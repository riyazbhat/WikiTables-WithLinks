  "/wiki/2012_Summer_Paralympics": "The 2012 Summer Paralympics , the 14th Summer Paralympic Games , and also more generally known as the London 2012 Paralympic Games , were a major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) , that took place in London , United Kingdom from 29 August to 9 September 2012 . These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the United Kingdom after the 2012 Summer Olympics , and until the date the largest Paralympics ever : 4,302 athletes from 164 National Paralympic Committees participated , with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics for the first time ever . The lead-up to these games prominently emphasized the return of the Paralympic movement to its spiritual birthplace : in 1948 , the British village of Stoke Mandeville first hosted the Stoke Mandeville Games , an athletics event for disabled British veterans of the Second World War held to coincide with the opening of the Summer Olympics in London . They were the first-ever organized sporting event for disabled athletes and served as a precursor to the modern Paralympic Games . Stoke Mandeville also co-hosted the 1984 Summer Paralympics with Long Island , New York , after its original host , the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , pulled out due to financial issues . Organizers expected the Games to be the first Paralympics to achieve mass-market appeal , fuelled by continued enthusiasm from the British public following the country 's successful performance at the Summer Olympics , awareness of the United Kingdom 's role in the history of the Paralympics , public attention surrounding South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius ( who had recently become the first double amputee to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes ) , a major marketing campaign instituted by the Games ' local broadcaster , and growing media coverage of Paralympic sport . The games ultimately met these expectations , breaking records for ticket sales , heightening the profile of the Paralympics in relation to the Olympics , and prompting IPC president Philip Craven to declare them the greatest Paralympic Games ever . A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games ; for the first time since their suspension after the 2000 Paralympics , events for the intellectually disabled were also held in selected sports . For the third Summer Paralympics in a row , China won the most medals overall , with a total of 231 ( 95 of them being gold ) , followed by Russia and Great Britain .",

The Games marked the first time a Latin American and South American city hosted the event , the second Southern Hemisphere city and nation , the first one being the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney , and also the first time a Lusophone ( Portuguese-speaking ) country hosted the event . These Games saw the introduction of two new sports to the Paralympic program : canoeing and the paratriathlon . The lead-up to these Paralympics were met with financial shortcomings attributed to tepid sponsor interest and ticket sales , which resulted in cuts to volunteer staffing and transport , the re-location of events and the partial deconstruction of the Deodoro venue cluster . However , ticket sales began to increase as the Games drew nearer , and over 2 million tickets were sold in total - overtaking Beijing 2008 as the second-most-attended Paralympic Games on record . The Russian doping scandal also affected these Paralympics ; unlike the Olympics , which selectively allowed Russian athletes to participate , the entire Russian team was banned from the Paralympics . A team of two refugee athletes also participated in Rio , hosted by the Greek and American Paralympic Committees . For the fourth consecutive Summer Paralympics , China topped the medal table , winning 107 gold medals , while Georgia , Kazakhstan , Malaysia , Uzbekistan , and Vietnam won their first ever Paralympic gold medals .
