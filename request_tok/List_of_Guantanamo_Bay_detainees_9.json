  "/wiki/Mamdouh_Habib": "Mamdouh Habib is an Egyptian and Australian citizen with dual nationality , best known for having been held for more than three years by the United States as an enemy combatant , by both the CIA and military authorities . He was sent by extraordinary rendition from Pakistan to Egypt after arrest , in violation of international law . He was held the longest at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as an enemy combatant . Finally released without charges in January 2005 , Habib struggled to have his account of his experiences believed , as he alleged he had been tortured by the CIA , Egyptians , and US military , at times with Australian intelligence officers present . For some time , each of the governments denied his allegations , but they have gradually been confirmed . Arrested after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 during a trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan , Habib was interrogated there by Pakistani and United States CIA agents before being shipped by extraordinary rendition to Egypt , where he was held for six months and interrogated more under torture . The CIA transferred him back to a black site in Afghanistan for more torture and interrogation , then to US military custody . In 2002 Habib was transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp . He continued to be held without charges and suffered coercive interrogation . The United States accused Habib of having had knowledge of the 11 September 2001 attacks , training the hijackers , staying at an al-Qaeda safe house in Afghanistan , conducting surveillance , helping to transfer chemical weapons , and planning to hijack the aircraft used in the 11 September attacks . He confessed to many acts under torture . But , there was no evidence to support these claims .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

He admits to being Osama bin Laden 's personal driver and said he needed the money . He was originally charged by a military tribunal with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism , but the process of military tribunals was challenged in a case that went to the US Supreme Court . In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld ( 2006 ) , the Court ruled that the military commissions as set up by the United States Department of Defense were flawed and unconstitutional . DOD continued to hold Hamdan as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo . After passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , Hamdan was tried on revised charges beginning July 21 , 2008 , the first of the detainees to be tried under the new system . He was found guilty of providing material support to al Qaeda , but was acquitted by the jury of terrorism conspiracy charges . He was sentenced to five-and-a-half years of imprisonment by the military jury , which credited him for his detention as having already served five years of the sentence . A Pentagon spokesman noted then that DOD might still classify Hamdan as an enemy combatant after he completed his sentence , and detain him indefinitely . In November 2008 , the U.S. transferred Hamdan to Yemen to serve out the remaining month of his sentence . He was released by the government there on January 8 , 2009 , permitting him to live with his family in Sana . On October 16 , 2012 , Hamdan 's entire conviction was overturned on appeal in the US Court of Appeals in Washington , DC , and he was acquitted of all charges .",

Critics of his imprisonment claimed his civil rights were violated and that he was denied due process of law under the U.S. Constitution . They said his imprisonment without formal charges and denial of right to counsel was illegal . On June 28 , 2004 , in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , the United States Supreme Court upheld the U.S. government 's ability to detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant , but granted him some due process rights and the ability to contest his enemy combatant status .

The purpose of the Board is to review whether the detainees still represent a threat . American President George W. Bush initially called the detainees illegal combatants . But , without a formal announcement of the policy change , the Bush Presidency changed their description to enemy combatant . From July 2004 through March 2005 , military authorities conducted a one-time Combatant Status Review Tribunal for each detainee , to confirm whether they had been properly been classified as an enemy combatant . The Combatant Status Reviews were criticized by human rights workers because the detainees were not entitled to legal counsel , and did not know what allegations they had to defend themselves against , and the detainees had no presumption of innocence . The ARB was created in an attempt to mitigate the harsh results of potentially indefinite detention by allowing an annual review to determine whether the enemy combatant should still be detained . The Combatant Status Reviews determined that 38 detainees were not illegal combatants after all . They determined that the rest of the detainees had been correctly classified as enemy combatants during their original , secret , classifications . The first set of Administrative Reviews took place between December 14 , 2004 and December 23 , 2005 . The Boards met to consider the cases of al 463 eligible detainees . They recommended the release of 14 detainees , and the repatriation of 120 detainees to the custody of the authorities in their home countries ."
