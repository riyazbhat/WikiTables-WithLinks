  "/wiki/Hudson's_Bay_Company": "The Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ; French : Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson ) is a Canadian retail business group . A fur trading business for much of its existence , HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada and the United States . The company sold most of its European operations by August 2019 and its remaining stores , in the Netherlands , were closed by the end of 2019 . HBC owns the Saks stores in the US ; most other US operations were sold by mid-2019 and the last remaining stores ( Lord & Taylor chain ) were sold prior to the end of 2019 . The company 's namesake business division is Hudson 's Bay , commonly referred to as The Bay ( La Baie in French ) . After incorporation by English royal charter in 1670 , the company functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America for nearly 200 years until the HBC sold the land it owned ( the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin , known as Rupert 's Land ) to Canada in 1869 as part of The Deed of Surrender , authorised by the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 . During its peak , the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English- and later British-controlled North America . By the mid-19th century , the company evolved into a mercantile business selling a wide variety of products from furs to fine homeware in a small number of sales shops ( as opposed to trading posts ) across Canada . These shops were the first step towards the department stores the company owns today . In 2008 , HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners , which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor . From 2008 to 2012 , the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC , Hudson 's Bay Trading Company , which was dissolved in early 2012 . HBC 's head office is currently located in Brampton , Ontario",
  "/wiki/James_Charles_Stuart_Strange": "James Charles Stuart Strange ( August 8 , 1753 - October 6 , 1840 ) was a British officer of the East India Company , one of the first maritime fur traders , a banker , and a member of parliament",
  "/wiki/East_India_Company": "The East India Company ( EIC ) , also known as the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) , East India Trading Company ( EITC ) , or the British East India Company , and informally known as John Company , Company Bahadur , or simply The Company , was an English and later British joint-stock company . It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region , initially with Mughal India and the East Indies , and later with Qing China . The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent , colonised parts of Southeast Asia , and colonised Hong Kong after a war with Qing China . Originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies , the company rose to account for half of the world 's trade , particularly in basic commodities including cotton , silk , indigo dye , salt , spices , saltpetre , tea , and opium . The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India . In his speech to the House of Commons in July 1833 , Lord Macaulay explained that since the beginning , the East India company had always been involved in both trade and politics , just as its French and Dutch counterparts had been . The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600 , coming relatively late to trade in the Indies . Before them the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia had traded there for much of the 16th century and the first of half a dozen Dutch Companies sailed to trade there from 1595 . These Dutch companies amalgamated in March 1602 into the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , which introduced the first permanent joint stock from 1612 ( meaning investment into shares did not need to be returned , but could be traded on a stock exchange ) . By contrast , wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the EIC 's shares . Initially the government owned no shares and had only indirect control until 1657 when permanent joint stock was established . During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India",

  "/wiki/Ship_breaking": "Ship-breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for either a source of parts , which can be sold for re-use , or for the extraction of raw materials , chiefly scrap . It may also be known as ship dismantling , ship cracking , or ship recycling . Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before corrosion , metal fatigue and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate . Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship , especially steel , to be recycled and made into new products . This lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process . Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused . While ship-breaking is sustainable , there are concerns about the use of poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation . It is also labour-intensive , and considered one of the world 's most dangerous industries . In 2012 , roughly 1,250 ocean ships were broken down , and their average age was 26 years . In 2013 , the world total of demolished ships amounted to 29,052,000 tonnes , 92 % of which were demolished in Asia . As of January 2020 , India has the largest global share at 30 % ; followed by Bangladesh , China and Pakistan . Alang , India currently has the world 's largest ship graveyard , followed by Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard in Bangladesh and Gadani in Pakistan",

The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent .

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom",

Chilcotin was the largest of the company 's three sternwheelers and was intended to run as competition against the BC Express Company 's new luxury sternwheeler , BX . Chilcotin had main , promenade and Texas decks , hot and cold running water and stateroom accommodation for fifty . She was built at Soda Creek in late 1909 and early 1910 , downstream from where the BC Express Company were building BX . A friendly rivalry quickly developed between the two construction camps and as soon as Chilcotin 's builders learned that BX was going to be 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) wider than Chilcotin , they teased the workers from the other camp , saying that BX would never fit through the narrow channels of the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons and called her the White Elephant . This rumor spread far past the town of Soda Creek and soon the employees of the BC Express Company found themselves being consoled by their friends and associates for having built a dud . However , BX proved to be a far superior craft and Chilcotin , was never much competition to her",
