  "/wiki/Presiding_Patriarch": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , the Presiding Patriarch ( also called Presiding Evangelist , Patriarch over the Church , Patriarch of the Church , or Patriarch to the Church ) is a church-wide leadership office within the priesthood . Among the duties of the Presiding Patriarch are to preside in council meetings , ordain other patriarchs , and administer patriarchal blessings . Originally , the office of Presiding Patriarch was one of the highest and most important offices of the church 's priesthood . The role was equated by Joseph Smith with Biblical patriarchs from Adam to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and it was expected that the office would descend through lineal succession from father to son . This precedent was set when Hyrum Smith , Joseph 's brother , became the second Presiding Patriarch because he was the eldest surviving son of the first Presiding Patriarch , Joseph Smith , Sr . When the office was given to Hyrum , he was given keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth , even the Church of the Latter Day Saints . Thus , some have argued that Presiding Patriarch is an office of the Patriarchal Priesthood . However , the existence and meaning of the Patriarchal Priesthood is controversial and uncertain .",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Smith": "Joseph Smith Jr. ( December 23 , 1805 - June 27 , 1844 ) was an American religious leader and founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement . When he was 24 , Smith published the Book of Mormon . By the time of his death , 14 years later , he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents . Smith was born in Sharon , Vermont . By 1817 , he had moved with his family to the burned-over district of western New York ; an area of intense religious revivalism during the Second Great Awakening . Smith said he experienced a series of visions , including one in 1820 during which he saw two personages ( presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ ) , and another in 1823 in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization . In 1830 , Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon . The same year he organized the Church of Christ , calling it a restoration of the early Christian church . Members of the church were later called Latter Day Saints or Mormons , and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . In 1831 , Smith and his followers moved west , planning to build a communalistic American Zion . They first gathered in Kirtland , Ohio and established an outpost in Independence , Missouri which was intended to be Zion 's center place . During the 1830s , Smith sent out missionaries , published revelations , and supervised construction of the Kirtland Temple .",
  "/wiki/President_of_the_Church": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , the President of the Church is generally considered to be the highest office of the church . It was the office held by Joseph Smith , founder of the movement , and the office assumed by many of Smith 's claimed successors , such as Brigham Young , Joseph Smith III , Sidney Rigdon , and James Strang . Several other titles have been associated with this office , including First Elder of the church , Presiding High Priest , President of the High Priesthood , Trustee-in-Trust for the church , Prophet , Seer , Revelator , and Translator . Joseph Smith was known by all of these titles in his lifetime ( although not necessarily with consistency ) . Smith died in 1844 without having indisputably established who was to be his successor . Therefore , his death was followed by a succession crisis in which various groups followed leaders with succession claims . Years later , the office of President was reorganized in many of the resulting Latter Day Saint denominations , the largest of which are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) , the Community of Christ ( formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ) , and The Church of Jesus Christ ( Bickertonite ) . Some smaller denominations , such as the Church of Christ ( Temple Lot ) , reject the office as an unscriptural creation .",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are apostles , with the calling to be prophets , seers , and revelators , evangelical ambassadors , and special witnesses of Jesus Christ . The quorum was first organized in 1835 and designated as a body of traveling councilors with jurisdiction outside areas where the church was formally organized , equal in authority to the First Presidency , the Seventy , the standing Presiding High Council , and the high councils of the various stakes . The jurisdiction of the Twelve was originally limited to areas of the world outside Zion or its stakes .

  "/wiki/Upper_Canada": "The Province of Upper Canada ( French : province du Haut-Canada ) was a part of British Canada established in 1791 by the Kingdom of Great Britain , to govern the central third of the lands in British North America , formerly part of the Province of Quebec since 1763 . Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior , excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay . The upper prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes , mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River , contrasted with Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) to the northeast . It was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution , who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada . The province was characterized by its British way of life , including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law , rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire . The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies . In 1812 , war broke out between Great Britain and the United States , leading to several battles in Upper Canada . The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada , but the war ended with the situation unchanged . The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons , known as the Family Compact , who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials . In 1837 , an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system . Representative government would be established in the 1840s . Upper Canada existed from its establishment on 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841 , when it was united with adjacent Lower Canada to form the Province of Canada .",

As the title of the calling suggests , men who held this position assisted the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in fulfilling their priesthood responsibilities . Assistants to the Twelve were general authorities , and were generally assigned by the Twelve Apostles to preside over and speak at stake conferences ; re-organize stakes ; tour missions ; and assist in the direction of worldwide missionary work . Like counselors in the First Presidency , Assistant to the Twelve was not a distinct priesthood office - rather , it was a calling that any worthy high priest could be asked to fill . In April 1941 , church president Heber J . Grant called five men to serve as Assistants to the Twelve . No more Assistants to the Twelve were called until 1951 ; the church continued to call Assistants to the Twelve throughout the 1950s , 1960s , and the first half of the 1970s . Of the 38 men who held the calling of Assistant to the Twelve , thirteen later became members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles : Marion G. Romney , George Q. Morris , Hugh B . Brown , Gordon B.

The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers .

Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

  "/wiki/Black_people": "Black people is a skin group-based classification used for specific people with a mid to dark brown complexion . Not all black people have dark skin ; however , in certain countries , often in socially based systems of racial classification in the Western World , the term black is used to describe persons who are perceived as dark-skinned compared to other populations . It is mostly used for the people of Sub-Saharan African descent and the indigenous peoples of Oceania , Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent . Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified black , and these social constructs have changed over time . In a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for blackness vary . In the United Kingdom , black was historically equivalent with person of color , a general term for non-European peoples . In other regions such as Australasia , settlers applied the term black or it was used by local populations with different histories and ancestral backgrounds . For many other individuals , communities and countries , black is also perceived as a derogatory , outdated , reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label , and as a result is neither used nor defined , especially in African cultures with little to no colonial history . Some have pointed out that labeling people groups black is erroneous as the people described as black have a brown skin color .",
