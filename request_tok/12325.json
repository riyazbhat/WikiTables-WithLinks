  "/wiki/Neolithic": "The Neolithic ( /\u02ccni\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ( listen ) , also known as the New Stone Age ) , the final division of the Stone Age , began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East , and later in other parts of the world . The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age . The term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system .",
  "/wiki/Copper_Age": "The Chalcolithic ( English : /\u02cck\u00e6lk\u0259\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ) , a name derived from the Greek : \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 khalk\u00f3s , copper and from \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone or Copper Age , also known as the Eneolithic or Aeneolithic ( from Latin aeneus of copper ) is an archaeological period which researchers usually regard as part of the broader Neolithic ( although scholars originally defined it as a transition between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age ) . In the context of Eastern Europe , archaeologists often prefer the term Eneolithic to Chalcolithic or other alternatives . In the Chalcolithic period , copper predominated in metalworking technology . Hence it was the period before it was discovered that adding tin to copper formed bronze ( a harder and stronger metal ) . The archaeological site of Belovode , on Rudnik mountain in Serbia , has the oldest securely-dated evidence of copper smelting , from 7000 BP ( c. 5000 BC ) . The Copper Age in the Ancient Near East began in the late 5th millennium BC and lasted for about a millennium before it gave rise to the Early Bronze Age . The transition from the European Copper Age to Bronze Age Europe occurs about the same time , between the late 5th and the late 3rd millennia BC .",
  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",
  "/wiki/Iron_Age": "The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity . It was preceded by the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Chalcolithic ) and the Bronze Age . The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East , and , by analogy , also to other parts of the Old World . The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration . It is defined by archaeological convention , and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture ; rather , the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread . For example , Tutankhamun 's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age . In the Ancient Near East , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse , in the 12th century BC . The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia . Its further spread to Central Asia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe is somewhat delayed , and Northern Europe is reached still later , by about 500 BC . The Iron Age is taken to end , also by convention , with the beginning of the historiographical record . This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record ; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC ( considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus ) is usually taken as a cut-off date , and in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age . The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD , with the beginning of the Viking Age .",
  "/wiki/Medieval": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

  "/wiki/Early_Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

  "/wiki/Sirmium": "Sirmium was a city in the Roman province of Pannonia .
