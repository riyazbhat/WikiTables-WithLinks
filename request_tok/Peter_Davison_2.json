  "/wiki/Love's_Labour's_Lost": "Love 's Labour 's Lost is one of William Shakespeare 's early comedies , believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the Inns of Court before Queen Elizabeth I . It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting . Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies makes them forsworn . In an untraditional ending for a comedy , the play closes with the death of the Princess 's father , and all weddings are delayed for a year . The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire , reckoning and rationalisation , and reality versus fantasy . Though first published in quarto in 1598 , the play 's title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play . While there are no obvious sources for the play 's plot , the four main characters are loosely based on historical figures . The use of apostrophes in the play 's title varies in early editions , though it is most commonly given as Love 's Labour 's Lost . Shakespeare 's audiences were familiar with the historical personages portrayed and the political situation in Europe relating to the setting and action of the play . Scholars suggest the play lost popularity as these historical and political portrayals of Navarre 's court became dated and less accessible to theatergoers of later generations . The play 's sophisticated wordplay , pedantic humour and dated literary allusions may also be cause for its relative obscurity , as compared with Shakespeare 's more popular works . Love 's Labour 's Lost was rarely staged in the 19th century , but it has been seen more often in the 20th and 21st centuries , with productions by both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre , among others",

  "/wiki/Brand_(play)": "Brand is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen . It is a verse tragedy , written in 1865 and first performed in Stockholm , Sweden on 24 March 1867 . Brand is a priest who accepts the consequence of his choices , and is deeply bound to doing the right thing . He believes primarily in the will of man , and lives by the belief all or nothing . To make compromises is therefore difficult , or questionable . His idea of God is derived from the Old Testament . Brand 's beliefs render him lonely , because those around him , when put to the test , generally can not or will not follow his example . He is a young idealist whose main purpose is to save the world , or at least people 's souls , but his judgment of others are harsh and unfair .

  "/wiki/Robin_Hood": "Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore and subsequently featured in literature and film . According to legend , he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman . In some versions of the legend , he is depicted as being of noble birth , and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff . In the oldest known versions he is instead a member of the yeoman class . Traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green , he is said to have robbed from the rich and given to the poor . Through retellings , additions , and variations , a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created . These include his lover , Maid Marian , his band of outlaws , the Merry Men , and his chief opponent , the Sheriff of Nottingham . The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard , to whom Robin Hood remains loyal . His partisanship of the common people and his hostility to the Sheriff of Nottingham are early recorded features of the legend , but his interest in the rightfulness of the king is not , and neither is his setting in the reign of Richard I . He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages , and the earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century ( 1400s ) . There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years , and the story continues to be widely represented in literature , film , and television . Robin Hood is considered one of the best known tales of English folklore",
  "/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers": "The Three Musketeers ( French : Les Trois Mousquetaires [ le t\u0281w\u0251 musk\u0259t\u025b\u02d0\u0281 ] ) is a historical adventure novel written in 1844 by French author Alexandre Dumas . Set between 1625 and 1628 , it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan ( a character based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan ) after he leaves home to travel to Paris , hoping to join the Musketeers of the Guard . Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately , he is befriended by the three most formidable musketeers of the age - Athos , Porthos and Aramis , the three inseparables- and becomes involved in affairs of state and at court . The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel . However , Dumas frequently portrays various injustices , abuses , and absurdities of the Ancien R\u00e9gime , giving the novel an additional political significance at the time of its publication , a time when the debate in France between republicans and monarchists was still fierce . The story was first serialised from March to July 1844 , during the July Monarchy , four years before the French Revolution of 1848 violently established the Second Republic . The story of d'Artagnan is continued in Twenty Years After and The Vicomte of Bragelonne : Ten Years Later",
  "/wiki/The_Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona": "The Two Gentlemen of Verona is a comedy by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written between 1589 and 1593 . It is considered by some to be Shakespeare 's first play , [ a ] and is often seen as showing his first tentative steps in laying out some of the themes and motifs with which he would later deal in more detail ; for example , it is the first of his plays in which a heroine dresses as a boy . The play deals with the themes of friendship and infidelity , the conflict between friendship and love , and the foolish behaviour of people in love . The highlight of the play is considered by some to be Launce , the clownish servant of Proteus , and his dog Crab , to whom the most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon has been attributed . Two Gentlemen is often regarded as one of Shakespeare 's weakest plays . It has the smallest named cast of any play by Shakespeare",
  "/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead": "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , often referred to as just Rosencrantz and Guildenstern , is an absurdist , existential tragicomedy by Tom Stoppard , first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966 . The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare 's Hamlet , the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern . The main setting is Denmark . The action of Stoppard 's play takes place mainly in the wings of Shakespeare 's , with brief appearances of major characters from Hamlet who enact fragments of the original 's scenes . Between these episodes the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events occurring onstage without them in Hamlet , of which they have no direct knowledge . Comparisons have also been drawn with Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot , for the presence of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character . Many plot features are similar as well : the characters pass time by playing Questions , impersonating other characters , and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time . In 2017 , Andy Propst of Time Out ranked Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead the 22nd greatest play of all time",
  "/wiki/Hamlet": "The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( /\u02c8h\u00e6ml\u026at/ ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601 . It is Shakespeare 's longest play with 30,557 words . Set in Denmark , the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his revenge against his uncle , Claudius , who has murdered Hamlet 's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet 's mother . Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others . It was one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers - from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch - and has been described as the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella . The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet , though some scholars believe Shakespeare wrote the Ur-Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century . Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others",

Wyndham , two theatrical managers and performers whose partnership became the renowned Howard & Wyndham Ltd created in 1895 by Michael Simons of Glasgow .

Opening night was 10 September 1883 with a performance of Much Ado About Nothing by the company of the London Lyceum Theatre and starring Henry Irving and Ellen Terry . In 1965 , the building was purchased by the Edinburgh Corporation to house the newly formed Royal Lyceum Theatre Company , who are now the permanent residents , leasing it from the local council .

  "/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew": "The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written between 1590 and 1592 .

The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly 's diversion . The main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio and Katherina , the headstrong , obdurate shrew . Initially , Katherina is an unwilling participant in the relationship ; however , Petruchio tames her with various psychological torments , such as keeping her from eating and drinking , until she becomes a desirable , compliant , and obedient bride . The subplot features a competition between the suitors of Katherina 's younger sister , Bianca , who is seen as the ideal woman . The question of whether the play is misogynistic has become the subject of considerable controversy , particularly among modern scholars , audiences , and readers . The Taming of the Shrew has been adapted numerous times for stage , screen , opera , ballet , and musical theatre ; perhaps the most famous adaptations being Cole Porter 's Kiss Me , Kate and the 1967 film of the play , starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton .

  "/wiki/Cinderella": "Cinderella , or The Little Glass Slipper , is a folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression and triumphant reward . Thousands of variants are known throughout the world . The protagonist is a young woman living in forsaken circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune . The story of Rhodopis , recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between around 7 BC and 23 AD , about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt , is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story . The Chinese story of Ye Xian , first attested in a source from around 860 AD , is another early variant of the story . The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634 ; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9 in 1697 . Another version was later published by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms ' Fairy Tales in 1812 . Although the story 's title and main character 's name change in different languages , in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name .
