  "/wiki/Trofeo_Mallorca": "The Challenge Vuelta Ciclista a Mallorca ( English : Tour of Majorca , Catalan : Challenge Volta Ciclista a Mallorca ) is a series of four ( five until 2012 ) professional one day road bicycle races held on the Spanish island of Mallorca in late January or early February .

Although the race styles itself as the Tour of Majorca it has never been allowed to be classed as a multi day stage race by the sports governing body the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) because the race rules allows riders not to participate on certain days if they dont want to . However , there is an unofficial overall classification winner taken on total time over five days . This laid back attitude by the race organisers makes the race popular with team managers who can bring a large squad ( sometimes as many as 20 riders ) and interchange them over the five days . Apart from the overall classification on time there are the usual Mountains , Points and Sprints competitions associated with any stage race . There is also a competition for the top Majorcan based rider , in the past this has been won by Vicente Reyn\u00e8s , Antonio Col\u00f3m and Antonio Tauler . The first day of racing is the Trofeo Mallorca which is a criterium ( circuit race ) around the streets of Palma .

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
