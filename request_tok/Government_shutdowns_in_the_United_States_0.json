Maine is the 12th smallest by area , the 9th least populous , and the 13th least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states . Located in New England , it is bordered by New Hampshire to the west , the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast , and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Qu\u00e9bec to the northeast and northwest , respectively . Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state , is the easternmost among the contiguous United States , and is the northernmost state east of the Great Lakes . Maine is known for its jagged , rocky coastline ; low , rolling mountains ; heavily forested interior ; and picturesque waterways , as well as its seafood cuisine , especially lobster and clams . There is a humid continental climate throughout most of the state , including coastal areas . Maine 's most populous city is Portland and its capital is Augusta . For thousands of years , indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine . At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine , several Algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area . The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island , by Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons . The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years .",

New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

The shutdown was the result of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ( DFL ) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature , that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30 . The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts , and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases , while Dayton demanded some tax increases .

During the shutdown all less important parts of the state government , that were not identified as critical services before the shutdown or in several court cases , suspended their operations . Most state government services were identified as critical or otherwise allowed to continue , so as much as 80 percent of state government spending continued . The eventual budget agreement started to form after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would reluctantly pass the last proposal of the Republican legislative leadership before the shutdown , but with conditions . The shutdown was disruptive to the government and some Minnesotans , but its ultimate economic impact was minimal . Politically , it could have influenced the Republican electoral defeat in the 2012 state elections , although there were other factors that may have been more important .",
