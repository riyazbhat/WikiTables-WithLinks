  "/wiki/Abortion": "Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus . [ note 1 ] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion . When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently induced miscarriage . The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion . A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a late termination of pregnancy or less accurately as a late term abortion . When properly done , abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths . It is safer than childbirth , which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States . Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions . The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy . The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device . Birth control , such as the pill or intrauterine devices , can be used immediately following abortion .",

After leaving Harvard , he continued to publicly promote the use of psychedelic drugs and became a well-known figure of the counterculture of the 1960s . He popularized catchphrases that promoted his philosophy , such as turn on , tune in , drop out , set and setting , and think for yourself and question authority .
