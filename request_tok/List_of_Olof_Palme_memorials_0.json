With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5 % of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture",

The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) .

The city is located in the heart of the former sovereign Principality of B\u00e9arn , of which it was the capital from 1464 . Bordered by the Gave de Pau , the city is located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) from the Atlantic Ocean and 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from Spain . This position gives it an exceptional panorama across the mountain range of the Pyrenees as well as on the hillsides of Juran\u00e7on . The name of Horizons Palois aims to protect this vision , in particular with the famous Boulevard des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es which extends for 1.8 kilometres ( 1.1 miles ) from the Ch\u00e2teau de Pau to the Parc Beaumont . Alphonse de Lamartine said : Pau has the world 's most beautiful view of the earth just as Naples has the most beautiful view of the sea . Archaeology has asserted that the site has been occupied at least since the Gallo-Roman era . [ note 1 ] Nevertheless , it was n't until the first half of the 12th century that the first mentions of Pau as a settlement are found . [ note 2 ] The town originated from the construction of its castle , likely from the 11th century by the Viscounts of B\u00e9arn , to protect the ford which was a strategic point for access to the Bearn valleys and then to Spain . The city thus took its name from the stockade ( pau in Bearnese ) which set the boundaries of the primitive castle . The village which was built around the castle took advantage of its strategic position as well as the protection of the Viscounts of B\u00e9arn to widely develop over the following centuries . Pau became the capital of B\u00e9arn in 1464 , thus becoming the political , cultural and economic centre of this small State which continued to defend its independence from the neighbouring French , English and Spanish territories",

Spanning 93,030 square kilometres ( 35,920 sq mi ) in the Carpathian Basin , it borders Slovakia to the north , Ukraine to the northeast , Romania to the east and southeast , Serbia to the south , Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest , and Austria to the west . With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union .

Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71 % of its territory , 58 % of its population , and 32 % of ethnic Hungarians",
