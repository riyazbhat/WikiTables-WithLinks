  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

Its vision is to harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research & planetary exploration . The Indian National Committee for Space Research ( INCOSPAR ) was established in the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) in 1962 , with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognizing the need in space research . INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969 , also under the DAE . In 1972 , Government of India had setup a Space Commission and the Department of Space ( DOS ) , bringing ISRO under the DOS .

It is a liquid-fueled two-stage rocket , first launched in 1967 and with over 420 successful launches to its name . The Kosmos-3M uses UDMH fuel and AK27I oxidizer ( red fuming nitric acid ) to lift roughly 1,400 kg ( 3,100 lb ) of payload into orbit . It differed from the earlier Kosmos-3 in its finer control of the second-stage burn , allowing operators to tune the thrust and even channel it through nozzles that helped orient the rocket for the launching of multiple satellites at one time . PO Polyot has manufactured these launch vehicles in the Russian town of Omsk for decades . It was originally scheduled to be retired from service in 2011 ; however , in April 2010 the Commander of the Russian Space Forces confirmed that it would be retired by the end of 2010 . One further launch , with Kanopus-ST , was planned ; however , this was cancelled in late 2012 as the rocket had exceeded its design life while in storage ahead of the launch .",

Sea Launch created the Land Launch offering to address lighter satellites directly into geosynchronous orbit or into geosynchronous transfer orbit , while Sea Launch continues to address the heavy satellite launch market . In 2002 , Sea Launch created Land Launch with its Russian and Ukrainian partners . The Russian and Ukrainian partners formed a Russian company Space International Services ( SIS ) to provide the launch services and launch operations . While the Sea Launch company maintains the rights to market Land Launch to the commercial community , the new entity SIS can market launch services to government customers . Land Launch uses Zenit rockets to conduct commercial satellite launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45/1 in Kazakhstan . Land Launch missions differ from Sea Launch missions in that the Zenit-3SLB is used , as opposed to the Zenit-3SL . The Zenit-3SLB utilizes substantially the same components as the Zenit-3SL but a smaller payload fairing is used to accommodate the smaller satellites launched from its northern operating location . The first launch was conducted on 28 April 2008 at 05:00 GMT , when a Zenit-3SLB was used to place AMOS-3 ( AMOS-60 ) a communications satellite , into a geosynchronous orbit . A second launch was completed on February 26 , 2009 when Land Launch successfully launched the Telstar 11N mission . A commercial version of the two-stage Zenit-2M , the Zenit-2SLB , is also offered for commercial launches utilizing Land Launch .",

  "/wiki/Strela_(rocket)": "Strela ( Russian : \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 , arrow ) is a Russian orbital carrier rocket , derived from the Soviet/Russian UR-100NU missile . It conducted its maiden test launch on 5 December 2003 , carried its first functional payload on 27 June 2013 , and a second one on 19 December 2014 . Strela was originally planned to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome , with test launches being conducted from existing UR-100 silos at the Baikonur Cosmodrome . Svobodny was closed in 2007 , without seeing any Strela launches . It is unclear whether a Strela launch complex will be incorporated into the Vostochny Cosmodrome , which is being built on the site of Svobodny . Strela differs from the Rockot , which is also derived from the UR-100 , in that it has undergone fewer modifications , such as the absence of an additional Briz-KM upper stage , as used on the Rockot . However it is equipped with a repurposed APB as upper stage , which was designed to deliver nuclear warheads . It is also launched from silos , whereas the Rockot is launched from flat pads .",

With over 1700 flights since its debut in 1966 , the Soyuz is the most frequently used launch vehicle in the world . When the U.S. Space Shuttle program ended in 2011 , Soyuz rockets became the only launch vehicles able to transport astronauts to the International Space Station . The Soyuz vehicles are used as the launcher for the crewed Soyuz spacecraft as part of the Soyuz program , as well as to launch uncrewed Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and for commercial launches marketed and operated by Starsem and Arianespace . All Soyuz rockets use RP-1 and liquid oxygen ( LOX ) propellant , with the exception of the Soyuz-U2 , which used Syntin , a variant of RP-1 , with LOX . The Soyuz family is a subset of the R-7 family .",
