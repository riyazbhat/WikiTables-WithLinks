  "/wiki/Ivy_League": "The Ivy League is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States .

While the term was in use as early as 1933 , it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954 . Seven of the eight schools were founded during the colonial period ( Cornell was founded in 1865 ) , and thus account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution . The other two colonial colleges , Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary , became public institutions instead . Ivy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious in the world , and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report .
