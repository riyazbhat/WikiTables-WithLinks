It was the de facto language of the Soviet Union until its dissolution on 25 December 1991 . Although nearly three decades have passed since the breakup of the Soviet Union , Russian is used in official capacity or in public life in all the post-Soviet nation-states , as well as in Israel and Mongolia . Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages , one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages , and part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch . Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onward . Russian is the largest native language in Europe and the most geographically widespread language in Eurasia . It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages , with 144 million speakers in Russia , Ukraine and Belarus . Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers . The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations . Russian is also the second most widespread language on the Internet , after English . Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without , the so-called soft and hard sounds .",

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",

Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the Cyrillic script ( see Ukrainian alphabet ) . Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the Old East Slavic of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus ' . After the fall of the Kievan Rus ' as well as the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia , the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language . The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century , associated with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate . From 1804 until the Russian Revolution , the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the Russian Empire , of which the biggest part of Ukraine ( Central , Eastern and Southern ) was a part at the time . It has always maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine , where the language was never banned , in its folk songs , itinerant musicians , and prominent authors . The standard Ukrainian language is regulated by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ( NANU ) , particularly by its Institute for the Ukrainian Language , Ukrainian language-information fund , and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies .

It was designed by the Soviet Union 's Mikoyan-Gurevich bureau and is one of the few combat aircraft built primarily using stainless steel . It was the last plane designed by Mikhail Gurevich before his retirement . The first prototype flew in 1964 , and the aircraft entered service in 1970 . It has an operational top speed of Mach 2.83 ( Mach 3.2 is possible but at risk of significant damage to the engines ) and features a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles . When first seen in reconnaissance photography , the large wing suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter , at a time when U.S. design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability due to combat performance in the Vietnam War . The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the West and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle then under development in the late 1960s . The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via Japan . It turned out that the aircraft 's weight necessitated its large wings . Production of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,186 aircraft . A symbol of the Cold War , the MiG-25 flew with Soviet allies and former Soviet republics , remaining in limited service in several export customers .

  "/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-9": "The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 ( , USAF/DoD designation : Type 1 , NATO reporting name : Fargo ) was the first turbojet fighter developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich in the years immediately after World War II . It used reverse-engineered German BMW 003 engines . Categorized as a first-generation jet fighter , it was moderately successful , but suffered from persistent problems with engine flameouts when firing its guns at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion . A number of different armament configurations were tested , but nothing solved the problem . Several different engines were evaluated , but none were flown as the prototype of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 promised superior performance . A total of 610 aircraft were built , including prototypes , and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces . At least 372 were transferred to the People 's Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against air raids by the Nationalist Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations . The MiG-9 was quickly replaced by the MiG-15 , and three are known to survive .",
  "/wiki/Tupolev_TB-3": "The Tupolev TB-3 ( , Tyazholy Bombardirovschik , Heavy Bomber , civilian designation ANT-6 ) was a heavy bomber aircraft which was deployed by the Soviet Air Force in the 1930s and during World War II . It was the world 's first cantilever wing four-engine heavy bomber . Despite obsolescence and being officially withdrawn from service in 1939 , the TB-3 performed bomber and transport duties throughout much of World War II . The TB-3 also saw combat as a Zveno project fighter mothership and as a light tank transport .",
  "/wiki/Petlyakov_Pe-8": "The Petlyakov Pe-8 ( ) was a Soviet heavy bomber designed before World War II , and the only four-engine bomber the USSR built during the war . Produced in limited numbers , it was used to bomb Berlin in August 1941 . It was also used for so-called morale raids designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities . Its primary mission , however , was to attack German airfields , rail yards and other rear-area facilities at night , although one was used to fly the People 's Commissar of Foreign Affairs ( Foreign Minister ) Vyacheslav Molotov from Moscow to the United States in 1942 . Originally designated the TB-7 , the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer , Vladimir Petlyakov , died in a plane crash in 1942 . Supply problems complicated the aircraft 's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems . As Soviet morale boosters , they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe 's fighter pilots . The loss rate of these aircraft , whether from mechanical failure , friendly fire , or combat , doubled between 1942 and 1944 . By the end of the war , most of the surviving aircraft had been withdrawn from combat units . After the war , some were modified as transports for important officials , and a few others were used in various Soviet testing programs . Some supported the Soviet Arctic operations until the late 1950s .",

The MiG-15 was one of the first successful jet fighters to incorporate swept wings to achieve high transonic speeds . In combat over Korea , it outclassed straight-winged jet day fighters , which were largely relegated to ground-attack roles , and was quickly countered by the similar American swept-wing North American F-86 Sabre . When refined into the more advanced MiG-17 , the basic design would again surprise the West when it proved effective against supersonic fighters such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in the Vietnam War of the 1960s . The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the most produced jet aircraft ; in excess of 13,000 were manufactured . Licensed foreign production may have raised the production total to almost 18,000 .
