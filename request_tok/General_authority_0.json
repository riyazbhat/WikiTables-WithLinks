  "/wiki/Presiding_Patriarch_(Mormonism)": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , the Presiding Patriarch ( also called Presiding Evangelist , Patriarch over the Church , Patriarch of the Church , or Patriarch to the Church ) is a church-wide leadership office within the priesthood . Among the duties of the Presiding Patriarch are to preside in council meetings , ordain other patriarchs , and administer patriarchal blessings . Originally , the office of Presiding Patriarch was one of the highest and most important offices of the church 's priesthood . The role was equated by Joseph Smith with Biblical patriarchs from Adam to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and it was expected that the office would descend through lineal succession from father to son . This precedent was set when Hyrum Smith , Joseph 's brother , became the second Presiding Patriarch because he was the eldest surviving son of the first Presiding Patriarch , Joseph Smith , Sr . When the office was given to Hyrum , he was given keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth , even the Church of the Latter Day Saints . Thus , some have argued that Presiding Patriarch is an office of the Patriarchal Priesthood . However , the existence and meaning of the Patriarchal Priesthood is controversial and uncertain .",

Assistants to the Twelve were general authorities , and were generally assigned by the Twelve Apostles to preside over and speak at stake conferences ; re-organize stakes ; tour missions ; and assist in the direction of worldwide missionary work .
