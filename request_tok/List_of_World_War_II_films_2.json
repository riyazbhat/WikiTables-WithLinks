  "/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army": "The Imperial Japanese Army ( Japanese : \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u56fd\u9678\u8ecd , Hepburn : Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun , Army of the Greater Japanese Empire ) was the official ground-based armed force of the Empire of Japan from 1868 to 1945 . It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of the Army , both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy . Later an Inspectorate General of Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army . During wartime or national emergencies , the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters ( IGHQ ) , an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff , the Minister of the Army , the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff , the Inspector General of Aviation , and the Inspector General of Military Training",
  "/wiki/Communists": "Communism ( from Latin communis , common , universal ) is a philosophical , social , political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society , namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes , money and the state . Communism includes a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism and anarchism ( especially anarcho-communism ) as well as the political ideologies grouped around both . All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system and mode of production , capitalism ; that in this system there are two major social classes ; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society ; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution . The two classes are the proletariat ( the working class ) - who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society - and the bourgeoisie ( the capitalist class ) - a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production . According to this analysis , revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production which is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism . Along with social democracy , communism became the dominant political tendency within the international socialist movement by the 1920s . While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world 's first nominally communist state led to communism 's widespread association with the Soviet economic model and Marxism-Leninism , some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism , or a non-planned administrative or command economy",
  "/wiki/Defense_of_Sihang_Warehouse": "The defense of Sihang Warehouse took place from October 26 to November 1 , 1937 , and marked the beginning of the end of the three-month Battle of Shanghai in the opening phase of the Second Sino-Japanese War . Defenders of the warehouse held out against numerous waves of Japanese forces and covered Chinese forces retreating west during the Battle of Shanghai . The successful defense of the warehouse provided a morale-lifting consolation to the Chinese army and people in the demoralizing aftermath of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai . [ citation needed ] The warehouse 's location just across the Suzhou Creek from the foreign concessions in Shanghai meant the battle took place in full view of the western powers . It was across from the foreign concessions in Shanghai , and the Japanese did not dare to call naval artillery strikes on the area , since a stray shot might land in the concessions and provoke an incident with the Europeans and Americans , whom the Japanese wanted to keep out of the war . Moreover , the Japanese dared not use mustard gas here as they did elsewhere in Shanghai , [ citation needed ] in full view of the foreign powers . This proximity drew the attention , if only briefly , of the international community to Chiang Kai-shek 's bid for worldwide support against Japanese aggression .

It has an area of 6.7 km2 ( 2.6 sq mi ) and is bordered to the north by Spain . The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling . The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because Spain asserts a claim to the territory . Gibraltarians rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and , in a 2002 referendum , the idea of shared sovereignty was also rejected",

  "/wiki/Second_Italo-Abyssinian_War": "The Second Italo-Ethiopian War , also referred to as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War , was a colonial war which was fought between October 1935 and February 1937 . It is seen as an example of the expansionist policy that characterized the Axis powers and the inefficiency of the League of Nations before the outbreak of World War II . On 3 October 1935 one hundred thousand soldiers of the Italian Army commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono attacked from Eritrea ( then an Italian colonial possession ) without prior declaration of war . At the same time a minor force under General Rodolfo Graziani attacked from Italian Somalia . On 6 October , Aduwa was conquered , a symbolic place for the Italian army . On 15 October , Italian troops seized Aksum , and the obelisk adorning the city was torn from its site and sent to Rome to be placed symbolically in front of the building of the Ministry of Colonies created by the fascist regime . Exasperated by De Bono 's slow and cautious progress , Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini put General Pietro Badoglio in his place . Ethiopian forces attacked the newly arrived invading army and launched a counterattack in December 1935 , but their rudimentary armed army could not resist well against the modern weapons of the Italians . Even the communications service of the Ethiopian forces depended on foot messengers , as they did not have radio devices . This was enough for the Italians to impose a narrow fence on Ethiopian detachments to leave them totally ignorant about the movements of their own army . Despite being allied with Italy , Nazi Germany sent arms and munitions to Ethiopia because it was frustrated over Italian objections to its policy towards Austria ; this prolonged the war and diverted Italian attention away from Austria . The Ethiopian counteroffensive managed to stop the Italian advance for a few weeks , but the superiority of the Italians ' weapons ( particularly heavy artillery and aviation ) prevented the Ethiopians from taking advantage of their initial successes",

Shanghai is a global center for finance , innovation , and transportation , and the Port of Shanghai is the world 's busiest container port . Originally a fishing village and market town , Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location . The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade after the First Opium War . The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established . The city then flourished , becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai . After the war , with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949 , trade was limited to other socialist countries , and the city 's global influence declined . In the 1990s , economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city , especially the Pudong district , aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city . The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance ; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization , and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , the first free-trade zone in China"
