It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington , D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 . The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",

The hall is a neo-classical building above the Danube River , in Donaustauf , east of Regensburg in Bavaria . The Walhalla is named for the Valhalla of Norse Paganism . It was conceived in 1807 by Crown Prince Ludwig in order to support the gathering momentum for the unification of the many German states . Following his accession to the throne of Bavaria , construction took place between 1830 and 1842 under the supervision of the architect Leo von Klenze .

  "/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster": "The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords , the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) . Part of the New Palace 's area of 3.24 hectares ( 8 acres ) was reclaimed from the River Thames , which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long ( 980 ft ) fa\u00e7ade , called the River Front . Augustus Pugin , a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style , assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace .",

It was built for the Paris Opera from 1861 to 1875 at the behest of Emperor Napoleon III . Initially referred to as le nouvel Op\u00e9ra de Paris ( the new Paris Opera ) , it soon became known as the Palais Garnier , in acknowledgment of its extraordinary opulence and the architect Charles Garnier 's plans and designs , which are representative of the Napoleon III style . It was the primary theatre of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989 , when a new opera house , the Op\u00e9ra Bastille , opened at the Place de la Bastille . The company now uses the Palais Garnier mainly for ballet . The theatre has been a monument historique of France since 1923 . The Palais Garnier has been called probably the most famous opera house in the world , a symbol of Paris like Notre Dame Cathedral , the Louvre , or the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Basilica . This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for Gaston Leroux 's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera and , especially , the novel 's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular 1986 musical . Another contributing factor is that among the buildings constructed in Paris during the Second Empire , besides being the most expensive , it has been described as the only one that is unquestionably a masterpiece of the first rank . This opinion is far from unanimous however : the 20th-century French architect Le Corbusier once described it as a lying art and contended that the Garnier movement is a d\u00e9cor of the grave .

Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions , just treatment of native inhabitants , human and drug trafficking , the arms trade , global health , prisoners of war , and protection of minorities in Europe . The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles , and it became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920 . The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920 , and the first meeting of Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920 . The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years . The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious First World War Allies ( France , the United Kingdom , Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the Executive Council ) to enforce its resolutions , keep to its economic sanctions , or provide an army when needed . The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so . Sanctions could hurt League members , so they were reluctant to comply with them . During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War , when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents , Benito Mussolini responded that the League is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935 , it had 58 members .",
