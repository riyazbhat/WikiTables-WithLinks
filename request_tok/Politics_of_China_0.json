  "/wiki/Chinese_characters": "Chinese characters ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u5b57 ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u5b57 ; pinyin : h\u00e0nz\u00ec ; literally : 'Han characters ' ) are logograms developed for the writing of Chinese . They have been adapted to write a number of other Asian languages . They remain a key component of the Japanese writing system where they are known as kanji . Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world . By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia , and historic use throughout the Sinosphere , Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users . Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands , though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts . Unlike an alphabet , a character-based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary . Functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters . In Japan , 2,136 are taught through secondary school ( the J\u014dy\u014d kanji ) ; hundreds more are in everyday use . Due to post-WWII simplifications of characters in Japan as well as in China , the Chinese characters used in Japan today are distinct from those used in China in several respects . There are various national standard lists of characters , forms , and pronunciations . Simplified forms of certain characters are used in mainland China , Singapore , and Malaysia ; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau , and to a limited extent in South Korea .",

This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles . For example , the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President , issues military directives as Chairman of the Central Military Commission , and upholds party rule as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China . The presidency was first established in the Constitution of the People 's Republic of China in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi . Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution , after which the presidency became vacant . The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975 , then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 , but with reduced powers .

Both the NPC and the NPCSC exercise the legislative power of the state . The NPCSC oversees the election of the NPC , and can extend the term of the current NPC by a put off election by at most a year with a two thirds majority vote . The NPCSC convenes the NPC once a year , and may do so when it finds it necessary or with a proposal from one fifth of NPC 's members . The NPCSC holds power until the succeeding NPC elects its standing committee . Members of the NPCSC must not , at the same time , hold executive , judicial , supervisory positions . In contrast , members of the NPC do not have this restriction . The NPCSC has the power to interpret the laws of the PRC , including its constitution . In contrast to other countries in which stare decisis gives the power of both final interpretation and adjudication to a supreme court , within Mainland China constitutional and legal interpretation is considered to be a legislative activity rather than a judicial one , and the functions are split so that the NPCSC provides legal interpretations while the Supreme People 's Court actually decides cases . Because an interpretation of the NPCSC is legislative in nature and not judicial , it does not affect cases which have already been decided . A notable use of the constitutional interpretation power occurred in 1999 over the Right of Abode issue in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration . The NPCSC interpreted the Basic Law of Hong Kong in accordance with the position taken by the Hong Kong government with respect to the eligibility of permanent residency in Hong Kong .",
