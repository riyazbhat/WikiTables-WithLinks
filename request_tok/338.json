With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20 % of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",
  "/wiki/The_Chicago_Defender": "The Chicago Defender is a Chicago-based online newspaper . The Defender was founded in 1905 by Robert S. Abbott for primarily African-American readers . Historically , it is considered the most important paper of what was then known as the colored or Negro press . Abbott 's newspaper reported and campaigned against Jim Crow era violence and urged blacks in the American South to come north in what became the Great Migration . Abbott worked out an informal distribution system with Pullman porters who surreptitiously ( and sometimes against southern state laws and mores ) took his paper by rail far beyond Chicago , especially to African American readers in the Southern United States . Under his nephew and chosen successor , John H. Sengstacke , the paper took on segregation , especially in the U.S. military , during World War II . Copies of the paper were passed along in communities , and it is estimated that at its most successful , each copy made its way into the hands of four or five African-Americans . In 1919-1922 , the Defender attracted the writing talents of Langston Hughes ; from the 1940s through 1960s Hughes also wrote an opinion column for the paper . Washington D.C and international correspondent Ethel Payne , poet Gwendolyn Brooks , author Willard Motley , and journalist Ida B . Wells wrote for the paper at different times . During the height of the civil rights movement era , it was published as The Chicago Daily Defender , a daily newspaper , beginning in 1956 . It returned to a weekly paper in 2008 .",

The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District .
