  "/wiki/Rhosymedre_(hymn_tune)": "Rhosymedre is the name of a hymn tune written by the 19th-century Welsh Anglican priest John David Edwards . Edwards named the tune after the village of Rhosymedre in the County Borough of Wrexham , Wales , where he was the vicar from 1843 until his death in 1885 . The hymn tune is seven lines long , with a metrical index of 6.6.6.6.8.8.8 . It appears in a number of hymnals and is sung to a variety of words . The tune was used by Ralph Vaughan Williams as the basis of the second movement of his organ composition Three Preludes on Welsh Hymn Tunes . Although best known in this original version for solo organ , it is also well known as an orchestral arrangement by Arnold Foster published in 1938 . The prelude has been arranged for other instruments or combinations of instruments , including solo piano , piano duet , clarinet choir and four recorders . The Prelude on the hymn tune 'Rhosymedre ' by Ralph Vaughan Williams was played at the Funeral of Diana , Princess of Wales by the request of Lady Sarah McCorquodale . It was also played at the weddings of her two sons : Prince William ( in April 2011 ) and Prince Harry ( in May 2018 ) . In 2008 , to mark the 50th anniversary of the death of Vaughan Williams , Richard Morrison ( chief music critic of The Times ) arranged the piece for string quartet and solo tenor . The first performance took place in May 2008 , with James Gilchrist singing the words of the hymn .",

  "/wiki/Organ_scholar": "An organ scholar is a young musician employed as a part-time assistant organist at a cathedral , church or institution where regular choral services are held . The idea of an organ scholarship is to provide the holder with playing , directing and administrative experience . It is an important part of music-making in Christian worship and is strongly associated with , but is not limited to , Anglican church music in the United Kingdom , Australia and the USA . Organ scholars may sometimes be found at a cathedral or a collegiate church . Many colleges at Oxford , Cambridge and Dublin universities , as well as other universities , offer organ scholarships to undergraduates . At some institutions ( for example , Christ Church , Oxford , New College , Oxford , Trinity College , Dublin or King 's College , Cambridge ) , the organ scholar ( s ) work under the direction of a full-time professional Director of Music . At other institutions , the organ scholar is in charge of running the choir . One of the first organ scholarships in the University of Cambridge was set up by Queens ' College , Cambridge . An early scholar there was the composer Charles Villiers Stanford , who took up his position there in 1870 . Many organ scholars have gone on to notable careers in music and in other fields . Two notable ex-organ scholars who went on to achieve fame in other fields are Edward Heath , who read Philosophy , Politics , and Economics at Balliol College , Oxford and later served as British Prime Minister 1970-1974 ; and Dudley Moore , who read music at Magdalen College , Oxford and went on to a career in acting .",

F2-F4 ) in choral music , and from the second G below middle C to the G above middle C ( G2 to G4 ) in operatic music , but the range can extend at either end .

  "/wiki/Norwich_Cathedral": "Norwich Cathedral is an English cathedral located in Norwich , Norfolk , dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity . It is the cathedral church for the Church of England Diocese of Norwich and is one of the Norwich 12 heritage sites . The cathedral was begun in 1096 and constructed out of flint and mortar and faced with a cream-coloured Caen limestone . An Anglo-Saxon settlement and two churches were demolished to make room for the buildings . The cathedral was completed in 1145 with the Norman tower still seen today topped with a wooden spire covered with lead . Several episodes of damage necessitated rebuilding of the east end and spire but since the final erection of the stone spire in 1480 there have been few fundamental alterations to the fabric . The large cloister has over 1,000 bosses including several hundred carved and ornately painted ones . Norwich Cathedral has the second largest cloisters in England , only exceeded by those at Salisbury Cathedral . The cathedral close is one of the largest in England and one of the largest in Europe and has more people living within it than any other close . The cathedral spire , measuring at 315 ft ( 96 m ) , is the second-tallest in England despite being partly rebuilt after being struck by lightning in 1169 , just 23 months after its completion , which led to the building being set on fire . Measuring 461 ft ( 141 m ) long and , with the transepts , 177 ft ( 54 m ) wide at completion , Norwich Cathedral was the largest building in East Anglia . There is no entry charge to visit the cathedral ; visitors are instead asked to make a suggested voluntary donation to help cover the costs of running the cathedral each year .",

A composer of both secular and sacred music , and a pioneer in the development of opera , he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history . Born in Cremona , where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions , Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua ( c. 1590-1613 ) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco . His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period , including problems of income , patronage and politics . Much of Monteverdi 's output , including many stage works , has been lost . His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals , large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine ( Vespers ) of 1610 , and three complete operas . His opera L'Orfeo ( 1607 ) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed ; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice , including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea . While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony , as evidenced in his madrigals , he undertook great developments in form and melody , and began to employ the basso continuo technique , distinctive of the Baroque . No stranger to controversy , he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica , contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica . Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries , his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century . He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded .",
