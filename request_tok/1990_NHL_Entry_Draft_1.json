Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization .

As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces .
