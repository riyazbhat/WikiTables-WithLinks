The ponies travel on adventures and help others around Equestria while working out problems that arise in their own friendships . The series has become a major commercial success , becoming the most highly rated original production in the Hub Network 's broadcast history and leading to new merchandising opportunities for Hasbro , including books , clothing , collectible trading cards , and comics .
