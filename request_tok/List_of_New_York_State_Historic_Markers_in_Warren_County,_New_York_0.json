That event was portrayed in James Fenimore Cooper 's novel The Last of the Mohicans . The fort 's construction was ordered by Sir William Johnson in September 1755 , during the French and Indian War , as a staging ground for attacks against the French fort at Crown Point called Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric . It was part of a chain of British and French forts along the important inland waterway from New York City to Montreal , and occupied a key forward location on the frontier between New York and New France . It was named for both Prince William , the Duke of Cumberland , the younger son of King George II , and Prince William Henry , Duke of Gloucester , a grandson of King George II and a younger brother of the future King George III .
