Tourists can see beer being made and packaged in a working part of the brewery . The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters ; the historic draft horses were originally used to pull wagons carrying beer in the 19th-century days of the company . Visitors to the brewery can observe the Clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house . Some of the herd is kept at the company farm in St. Louis County . Known as Grant 's Farm ( having been owned by former President Ulysses S. Grant at one time ) , this complex is home to a menagerie of animals such as elephants , tortoises , and a variety of exotic hooved mammals . Since 2008 , approximately half of the Budweiser Clydesdales are kept at the Warm Springs Ranch near Booneville , Missouri .

  "/wiki/Gargoyle": "In architecture , a gargoyle ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0r\u0261\u0254\u026al/ ) is a carved or formed grotesque:6-8 with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building , thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between . Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm . A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth . Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall . When Gothic flying buttresses were used , aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls .",

  "/wiki/Missouri_River": "The Missouri River is the longest river in North America . Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana , the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles ( 3,767 km ) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis , Missouri . The river drains a sparsely populated , semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles ( 1,300,000 km2 ) , which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces . Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river . Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed , leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history .",

The Corps of Discovery was a selected group of US Army volunteers under the command of Captain Meriwether Lewis and his close friend Second Lieutenant William Clark . President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the expedition shortly after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to explore and to map the newly acquired territory , to find a practical route across the western half of the continent , and to establish an American presence in this territory before Britain and other European powers tried to claim it . The campaign 's secondary objectives were scientific and economic : to study the area 's plants , animal life , and geography , and to establish trade with local American Indian tribes . The expedition returned to St. Louis to report its findings to Jefferson , with maps , sketches , and journals in hand .",
  "/wiki/American_West": "The Western United States ( also called the American West , the Far West , and the West ) is the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States . As European settlement in the U.S. expanded westward through the centuries , the meaning of the term the West changed . Before about 1800 , the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier . The frontier moved westward and eventually the lands west of the Mississippi River were considered the West . The U.S. Census Bureau 's definition of the 13 westernmost states includes the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin to the Pacific Coast , and the mid-Pacific islands state , Hawaii . To the east of the Western United States is the Midwestern United States and the Southern United States , with Canada to the north or east , and Mexico generally to the south .

  "/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail": "The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century route through central North America that connected Franklin , Missouri with Santa Fe , New Mexico . Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell , who departed from the Boonslick region along the Missouri River , the trail served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880 . Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro , which carried trade from Mexico City . The route skirted the northern edge and crossed the north-western corner of Comancheria , the territory of the Comanches , who demanded compensation for granting passage to the trail , and represented another market for American traders . Comanche raiding farther south in Mexico isolated New Mexico , making it more dependent on the American trade , and provided the Comanches with a steady supply of horses for sale . By the 1840s , trail traffic along the Arkansas Valley was so heavy that bison herds could not reach important seasonal grazing land , contributing to their collapse , which in turn hastened the decline of Comanche power in the region . The American army used the trail route in 1846 for the invasion of New Mexico during the Mexican-American War . After the U.S. acquisition of the Southwest ending the war , the trail helped open the region to U.S. economic development and settlement , playing a vital role in the expansion of the U.S. into the lands it had acquired . The road route is commemorated today by the National Park Service as the Santa Fe National Historic Trail . A highway route that roughly follows the trail 's path through the entire length of Kansas , the southeast corner of Colorado and northern New Mexico has been designated as the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway .",

  "/wiki/Painting": "Painting is the practice of applying paint , pigment , color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the matrix or support ) . The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush , but other implements , such as knives , sponges , and airbrushes , can be used . The final work is also called a painting . Painting is an important form in the visual arts , bringing in elements such as drawing , gesture ( as in gestural painting ) , composition , narration ( as in narrative art ) , or abstraction ( as in abstract art ) . Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in a still life or landscape painting ) , photographic , abstract , narrative , symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) , emotive ( as in Expressionism ) , or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) . A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin . In art , the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action . The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls , paper , canvas , wood , glass , lacquer , pottery , leaf , copper and concrete , and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand , clay , paper , plaster , gold leaf , as well as objects .",

Unlike a border - a rigid and clear-cut form of state boundary - in the most general sense a frontier can be fuzzy or diffuse . For example , the frontier between the Eastern United States and the Old West in the 1800s was an area where European American settlements gradually thinned out and gave way to Native American settlements or uninhabited land . The frontier was not always a single continuous area , as California and various large cities were populated before the land that connected those to the East .",

  "/wiki/Lead": "Lead ( /\u02c8l\u025bd/ ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pb ( from the Latin plumbum ) and atomic number 82 . It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials . Lead is soft and malleable , and also has a relatively low melting point . When freshly cut , lead is silvery with a hint of blue ; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air . Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements . Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal . Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature ; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases , and it tends to form covalent bonds . Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group . Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds . Like the lighter members of the group , lead tends to bond with itself ; it can form chains and polyhedral structures . Lead is easily extracted from its ores ; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it . Galena , a principal ore of lead , often bears silver , interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome .",

Poteaux-sur-sol has also , confusingly , been used for other types of timber framing which have a sill timber such as post-and-plank , but this is considered incorrect by some scholars . Poteaux-sur-sol is a part of American historic carpentry but is known by its French name in North America as it was used by French and French-Canadian people in the region historically known as New France .

The tribe developed in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys around 700 BC along with other groups of its language family . They migrated west of the Mississippi after the 17th century due to wars with Iroquois invading the Ohio Valley from New York and Pennsylvania in a search for new hunting grounds . The nations separated at that time , and the Osage settled near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers . The term Osage is a French version of the tribe 's name , which can be roughly translated as warlike . The Osage people refer to themselves in their indigenous Dhegihan Siouan language as \ud801\udccf\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcdf ( Wazhazhe ) , or Mid-waters . At the height of their power in the early 19th century , the Osage had become the dominant power in the region , feared by neighboring tribes . The tribe controlled the area between the Missouri and Red rivers , the Ozarks to the east and the foothills of the Wichita Mountains to the south . They depended on nomadic buffalo hunting and agriculture . The 19th-century painter George Catlin described the Osage as the tallest race of men in North America , either red or white skins ; there being ... many of them six and a half , and others seven feet . The missionary Isaac McCoy described the Osage as an uncommonly fierce , courageous , warlike nation and said they were the finest looking Indians I have ever seen in the West .

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers - and many , especially in the Amazon basin , still are - many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas . Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting and gathering . In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , city-states , chiefdoms , states , kingdoms and empires . Among these are the Aztec , Inca and Maya states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world . They had a vast knowledge of engineering , architecture , mathematics , astronomy , writing , physics , medicine , planting and irrigation , geology , mining , sculpture and goldsmithing .

The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/James_Beauchamp_Clark": "James Beauchamp Clark ( March 7 , 1850 - March 2 , 1921 ) was a prominent American politician in the Democratic Party from the 1890s until his death . He represented Missouri in the United States House of Representatives and served as Speaker of the House from 1911 to 1919 . Born in Kentucky , he established a law practice in Bowling Green , Missouri . He won election to the House in 1892 , lost his seat in 1894 , and won the seat back in 1896 . He became the House Minority Leader in 1908 and was elevated to Speaker after Democrats took control of the House in the 1910 elections . He inadvertently helped defeat the Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 by arguing that ratification of the treaty would lead to the incorporation of Canada into the United States . Entering the 1912 Democratic National Convention , Clark had won the backing of a majority of the delegates , but lacked the necessary two-thirds majority to win the presidential nomination . After dozens of ballots , Woodrow Wilson emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee , and went on to win the 1912 presidential election . Clark helped Wilson pass much of his progressive agenda but opposed U.S. entry into World War I . The 1920 House elections saw the defeat of numerous Democrats , including Clark . He died the following March , two days before he would have left office .",

  "/wiki/Eads_Bridge": "Eads Bridge is a combined road and railway bridge over the Mississippi River connecting the cities of St. Louis , Missouri and East St. Louis , Illinois . It is located on the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede 's Landing , to the north , and the grounds of the Gateway Arch , to the south . The bridge is named for its designer and builder , James Buchanan Eads . Opened in 1874 , Eads Bridge was the first bridge erected across the Mississippi south of the Missouri River . Earlier bridges were located north of the Missouri , where the Mississippi is smaller . None of the earlier bridges survive ; Eads Bridge is the oldest bridge on the river . At 520 feet between the piers , the center arch of Eads Bridge was the longest rigid span ever built at the time of its construction ( only a few suspension bridges had longer spans ) . It remained the longest rigid span until the completion of the 525 foot ( 160 meter ) arch of Gustave Eiffel 's Maria Pia Bridge , in Porto , Portugal , in 1877 . Extending more than 100 ft below water level , the foundations for Eads Bridge were the deepest underwater constructions of their time . They were installed using pneumatic caissons , a pioneering application of caisson technology in the United States and , at the time , by far the largest caissons ever built . The Eads Bridge caissons were the model for subsequent projects including the Brooklyn Bridge which was constructed just a few years later . During construction , the partially-completed arches were suspended from above , on cables rigged to temporary wooden towers which were erected on top of the piers .",

The will of the Swedish chemist , engineer and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895 . The prizes in Chemistry , Literature , Peace , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901 . The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields . In 1968 , Sveriges Riksbank , Sweden 's central bank , established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel . The award is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the bank 's 300th anniversary . The first Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen in 1969 . The Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , Stockholm , Sweden , according to the same principles as for the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded since 1901 . The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , the Nobel Prize in Physics , and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ; the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature ; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Nobel Peace Prize .

  "/wiki/Dred_Scott": "Dred Scott ( c. 1799 - September 17 , 1858 ) was an enslaved African American man in the United States who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom and that of his wife and their two daughters in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case of 1857 , popularly known as the Dred Scott case . Scott claimed that he and his wife should be granted their freedom because they had lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory for four years , where slavery was illegal and their laws said that slaveholders gave up their rights to slaves if they stayed for an extended period . In a landmark case , the United States Supreme Court decided 7-2 against Scott , finding that neither he nor any other person of African ancestry could claim citizenship in the United States , and therefore Scott could not bring suit in federal court under diversity of citizenship rules . Moreover , Scott 's temporary residence outside Missouri did not bring about his emancipation under the Missouri Compromise , as the court ruled this to have been unconstitutional , as it would improperly deprive Scott 's owner of his legal property . While Chief Justice Roger B. Taney had hoped to settle issues related to slavery and Congressional authority by this decision , it aroused public outrage , deepened sectional tensions between the northern and southern states , and hastened the eventual explosion of their differences into the American Civil War . President Abraham Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , and the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments - the Thirteenth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments - nullified the decision . The Scotts were manumitted by a private arrangement in May 1857 . Dred Scott died of tuberculosis a few months later .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it .

  "/wiki/Scott_v._Sandford": "Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. ( 19 How . ) 393 ( 1857 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court held that the Constitution of the United States was not meant to include American citizenship for black people , regardless of whether they were enslaved or free , and therefore the rights and privileges it confers upon American citizens could not apply to them . The decision was made in the case of Dred Scott , an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri , which was a slave-holding state , into the Missouri Territory , most of which had been designated free territory by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 . When his owners later brought him back to Missouri , Scott sued in court for his freedom , claiming that because he had been taken into free U.S. territory , he had automatically been freed , and was legally no longer a slave . Scott sued first in Missouri state court , which ruled that he was still a slave under its law . He then sued in U.S. federal court , which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case . He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court . In March 1857 , the Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision against Dred Scott . In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roger Taney , the Court ruled that black people are not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word 'citizens ' in the Constitution , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States . Taney supported his ruling with an extended survey of American state and local laws from the time of the Constitution 's drafting in 1787 purporting to show that a perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery . Because the Court ruled that Scott was not an American citizen , any federal lawsuit he filed automatically failed because he could never establish the diversity of citizenship that Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires for an American federal court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over a case . After ruling on these issues surrounding Scott , Taney continued further and struck down the entire Missouri Compromise as a limitation on slavery that exceeded the U.S. Congress 's powers under the Constitution .",

At a factory , local inhabitants could interact with foreign merchants , often known as factors . First established in Europe , factories eventually spread to many other parts of the world . The factories established by European states in Africa , Asia and the Americas from the 15th century onward also tended to be official political dependencies of those states . These have been seen , in retrospect , as the precursors of colonial expansion . A factory could serve simultaneously as market , warehouse , customs , defense and support to navigation exploration , headquarters or de facto government of local communities . In North America , Europeans began to interact with pre-existing native American trade systems during the 16th century .

  "/wiki/Minstrel_show": "The minstrel show , or minstrelsy , was an American form of entertainment developed in the early 19th century . Each show consisted of comic skits , variety acts , dancing , and music performances that mocked people specifically of African descent . The shows were performed by white people in make-up or blackface for the purpose of playing the role of black people . There were also some African-American performers and all-black minstrel groups that formed and toured under the direction of white people . Minstrel shows lampooned black people as dim-witted , lazy , buffoonish , superstitious , and happy-go-lucky . Minstrel shows emerged as brief burlesques and comic entr'actes in the early 1830s in the Northeastern states . They were developed into full-fledged form in the next decade . By 1848 , blackface minstrel shows were the national artform , translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience . By the turn of the 20th century , the minstrel show enjoyed but a shadow of its former popularity , having been replaced for the most part by vaudeville . The form survived as professional entertainment until about 1910 ; amateur performances continued until the 1960s in high schools and local theaters . The genre has had a lasting legacy and influence and was featured in a television series as recently as 1975 . Generally , as the civil rights movement progressed and gained acceptance , minstrels lost popularity .",
  "/wiki/Vaudeville": "Vaudeville ( /\u02c8v\u0254\u02d0d ( \u0259 ) v\u026al/ ; French : [ vodvil ] ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 19th century . A vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions , based on a comical situation : a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry , interspersed with songs or ballets . It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s , but the idea of vaudeville 's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent . In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain , a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate , unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill . Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians , singers , dancers , comedians , trained animals , magicians , ventriloquists , strongmen , female and male impersonators , acrobats , clowns , illustrated songs , jugglers , one-act plays or scenes from plays , athletes , lecturing celebrities , minstrels , and movies . A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a vaudevillian . Vaudeville developed from many sources , also including the concert saloon , minstrelsy , freak shows , dime museums , and literary American burlesque . Called the heart of American show business , vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades .",
  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception .

  "/wiki/Graham_Cave": "Graham Cave is a Native American archeological site near Mineola , Missouri in Montgomery County in the hills above the Loutre River . It is located in the 356 acre Graham Cave State Park . The entrance of the sandstone cave forms a broad arch 120 feet ( 37 m ) wide and 16 feet ( 5 m ) high . Extending about 100 feet ( 30 m ) into the hillside , the cave protects an historically important Pre-Columbian archaeological site from the ancient Dalton and Archaic period dating back to as early as 10,000 years ago . Graham cave was formed at the point of contact of Jefferson City dolomite and St. Peter sandstone . Due to water flowing and freezing , the cave grew over the years . The cave originally extended about 100 feet into the hill , but an accumulation of debris over the years filled the lower part of the cave with about seven feet of deposits . With a broad entrance , the cave provided sufficient shelter to humans and animals alike . Robert Graham , who originally settled in the area in 1816 when he purchased some bottomland from a son of Daniel Boone , purchased the property including the cave in 1847 . Graham 's son D.F . Graham sheltered hogs in the cave and became interested in archeology from the artifacts he found there . After his death , his collection of artifacts was offered by his son Benjamin to the University of Missouri , which investigated the cave in 1930 .",

The Eastern Woodlands extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains , and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico , which is now occupied by the eastern United States and Canada . The Plains Indians culture area is to the west ; the Subarctic area to the north . The Indigenous people of the Eastern Woodlands spoke languages belonging to several language groups , including Algonquian , Iroquoian , Muskogean , and Siouan , as well as apparently isolated languages such as Calusa , Chitimacha , Natchez , Timucua , Tunica and Yuchi . The earliest known inhabitants of the Eastern Woodlands were the Adena and Hopewell , who inhabited the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys between 800 BC and 800 AD . These tribes , as well as the other Iroquoian-speaking people , were mound builders . They also relied on farming to produce food because of the fertile land in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys . Because of this reliance on farming , these tribes did not migrate like the more northern Eastern Woodlands tribes and instead stayed in one place , which resulted in them developing new social and political structures . The Eastern Woodlands tribes located further north ( Algonquian-speaking people ) relied heavily on hunting to acquire food . These tribes did not plant many crops , however , some tribes , such as the Ojibwe , grew wild rice and relied on it as one of their major food sources . The type of animals these tribes hunted depended on the geographic location of the tribe . For example , the tribes located close to the coast hunted seals , porpoises , and whales , while the more inland tribes hunted deer , moose , and caribou .",

  "/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch": "Ferdinand Foch ( French : [ f\u0254\u0283 ] ; 2 October 1851 - 20 March 1929 ) was a French general and military theorist who served as the Supreme Allied Commander during the First World War . An aggressive , even reckless commander at the First Marne , Flanders , and Artois campaigns of 1914-1916 , Foch became the Allied Commander-in-Chief in late March 1918 in the face of the all-out German spring offensive , which pushed the Allies back using fresh soldiers and new tactics that trenches could not contain . He successfully coordinated the French , British and American efforts into a coherent whole , deftly handling his strategic reserves . He stopped the German offensive and launched a war-winning counterattack . In November 1918 , Marshal Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities and was present at the armistice of 11 November 1918 . At the outbreak of war in August 1914 , Foch 's XX Corps participated in the brief invasion of Germany before retreating in the face of a German counter-attack and successfully blocking the Germans short of Nancy . Ordered west to defend Paris , Foch 's prestige soared as a result of the victory at the Marne , for which he was widely credited as a chief protagonist while commanding the French Ninth Army . He was then promoted again to Assistant Commander-in-Chief for the Northern Zone , a role which evolved into command of Army Group North , and in which role he was required to cooperate with the British forces at Ypres and the Somme . At the end of 1916 , partly owing to the disappointing results of the latter offensive and partly owing to wartime political rivalries , Foch was transferred to Italy . Foch was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on 26 March 1918 following being the Commander-in-Chief of Western Front with the title G\u00e9n\u00e9ralissime in 1918 . He played a decisive role in halting a renewed German advance on Paris in the Second Battle of the Marne , after which he was promoted to Marshal of France . Addington says , to a large extent the final Allied strategy which won the war on land in Western Europe in 1918 was Foch 's alone .",

His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) on the Western Front in World War I , 1917-18 . Pershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies , and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command , although some American divisions fought under British command , and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the French army . Pershing 's soldiers first saw serious battle at Cantigny , Chateau-Thierry , Belleau Wood , and Soissons . To speed up the arrival of American troops , they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind , and used British and French tanks , artillery , airplanes and other munitions . In September 1918 at St. Mihiel , the First Army was directly under Pershing 's command ; it overwhelmed the salient - the encroachment into Allied territory - that the German Army had held for three years . For the Meuse-Argonne Offensive , Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne , keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days , alongside the French . The Allied Hundred Days Offensive , which the Argonne fighting was part of , contributed to Germany calling for an armistice . Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of Germany should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism . Pershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to General of the Armies rank , the highest possible rank in the United States Army .

  "/wiki/John_J._Pershing": "General of the Armies John Joseph Black Jack Pershing ( September 13 , 1860 - July 15 , 1948 ) GCB was a senior United States Army officer . His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) on the Western Front in World War I , 1917-18 . Pershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies , and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command , although some American divisions fought under British command , and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the French army . Pershing 's soldiers first saw serious battle at Cantigny , Chateau-Thierry , Belleau Wood , and Soissons . To speed up the arrival of American troops , they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind , and used British and French tanks , artillery , airplanes and other munitions . In September 1918 at St. Mihiel , the First Army was directly under Pershing 's command ; it overwhelmed the salient - the encroachment into Allied territory - that the German Army had held for three years . For the Meuse-Argonne Offensive , Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne , keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days , alongside the French . The Allied Hundred Days Offensive , which the Argonne fighting was part of , contributed to Germany calling for an armistice . Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of Germany should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism . Pershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to General of the Armies rank , the highest possible rank in the United States Army . [ Notes 1 ] Allowed to select his own insignia , Pershing chose to use four gold stars to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of General , which was signified with four silver stars . After the creation of the five-star General of the Army rank during World War II , his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a six-star general , but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted on by Congress ."
