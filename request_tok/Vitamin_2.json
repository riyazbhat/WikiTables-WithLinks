  "/wiki/Adenine": "Adenine /\u02c8\u00e6d\u026an\u026an/ ( A , Ade ) is a nucleobase ( a purine derivative ) . It is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G-C-A-T . The three others are guanine , cytosine and thymine . Its derivatives have a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration , in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) . It also has functions in protein synthesis and as a chemical component of DNA and RNA . The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA . The adjacent image shows pure adenine , as an independent molecule . When connected into DNA , a covalent bond is formed between deoxyribose sugar and the bottom left nitrogen , so removing the hydrogen . The remaining structure is called an adenine residue , as part of a larger molecule . Adenosine is adenine reacted with ribose , as used in RNA and ATP ; deoxyadenosine is adenine attached to deoxyribose , as used to form DNA .",
  "/wiki/Adenylic_acid": "Adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) , also known as 5'-adenylic acid , is a nucleotide . AMP consists of a phosphate group , the sugar ribose , and the nucleobase adenine ; it is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine . As a substituent it takes the form of the prefix adenylyl- . AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes , being interconverted to ADP and/or ATP . AMP is also a component in the synthesis of RNA .",
  "/wiki/Carnitine": "Carnitine ( \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b3-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid , 3-hydroxy-4-N , N , N-trimethylaminobutyrate ) is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals , plants , and some bacteria . Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers ( the two enantiomers d-carnitine and l-carnitine ) . Both are biologically active but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form . At room temperature , pure carnitine is a white powder , and a water-soluble zwitterion with low toxicity . Carnitine , derived from an amino acid , is found in nearly all organisms and animal tissue . Carnitine is the generic expression for a number of compounds that include l-carnitine , acetyl-l-carnitine , and propionyl-l-carnitine . It is most accumulated in cardiac and skeletal muscles as it accounts for 0.1% of its dry matter . It was first derived from meat extracts in 1905 , therefore the name carnitine is derived from Latin caro/carnis or flesh . The body synthesizes enough carnitine from lysine side chains to keep up with the needs of energy production in the body as carnitine acts as a transporter of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria to be oxidized and produce energy . Some individuals with genetic or medical disorders ( such as preterm infants ) can not make enough , so this makes carnitine a conditionally essential nutrient for them .",
  "/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid": "Essential fatty acids , or EFAs , are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but can not synthesize them . The term essential fatty acid refers to fatty acids required for biological processes but does not include the fats that only act as fuel . Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils , which are essential in the sense of being a concentrated essence . Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans : alpha-linolenic acid ( an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid ( an omega-6 fatty acid ) . Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as conditionally essential , meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions ; examples include docosahexaenoic acid ( an omega-3 fatty acid ) and gamma-linolenic acid ( an omega-6 fatty acid ) . When the two EFAs were discovered in 1923 , they were designated vitamin F , but in 1929 , research on rats showed that the two EFAs are better classified as fats rather than vitamins .",
  "/wiki/Riboflavin": "Riboflavin , also known as vitamin B2 , is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement . Food sources include eggs , green vegetables , milk and other dairy product , meat , mushrooms , and almonds . Some countries require its addition to grains . As a supplement it is used to prevent and treat riboflavin deficiency and prevent migraines . It may be given by mouth or injection . It is nearly always well tolerated . Normal doses are safe during pregnancy . Riboflavin is in the vitamin B group . It is required by the body for cellular respiration . Riboflavin was discovered in 1920 , isolated in 1933 , and first made in 1935 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system . Riboflavin is available as a generic medication and over the counter .",
  "/wiki/B_vitamins": "B vitamins are a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism . Though these vitamins share similar names , they are chemically distinct compounds that often coexist in the same foods . In general , dietary supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex . Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific number or name of each vitamin : B1 = thiamine , B2 = riboflavin , B3 = niacin , etc . Some are better known by name than number : niacin , pantothenic acid , biotin and folate . Each B vitamin is either a cofactor ( generally a coenzyme ) for key metabolic processes or is a precursor needed to make one .",
  "/wiki/Biotin": "Biotin , also called vitamin H ( the H represents Haar und Haut , German words for hair and skin ) , vitamin B7 or vitamin B8 ( in many countries like France , where vitamin B7 is used for Inositol ) is a water-soluble B vitamin . It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes , both in humans and in other organisms , primarily related to the utilization of fats , carbohydrates , and amino acids . Biotin deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism . Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms , such as hair thinning , brittle fingernails , or skin rash , typically on the face . Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984 , with many countries testing for this disorder at birth . Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened , obscuring the true prevalence of the disorder .",
  "/wiki/Catechol": "Catechol ( /\u02c8k\u00e6t\u026at\u0283\u0252l/ or /\u02c8k\u00e6t\u026ak\u0252l/ ) , also known as pyrocatechol or 1,2-dihydroxybenzene , is an organic compound with the molecular formula C6H4 ( OH ) 2 . It is the ortho isomer of the three isomeric benzenediols . This colorless compound occurs naturally in trace amounts . It was first discovered by destructive distillation of the plant extract catechin . About 20,000 tonnes of catechol is now synthetically produced annually as a commodity organic chemical , mainly as a precursor to pesticides , flavors , and fragrances . Catechol occurs as feathery white crystals that are very rapidly soluble in water .",
  "/wiki/Flavin_group": "Flavin ( from Latin flavus , yellow ) is the common name for a group of organic compounds based on pteridine , formed by the tricyclic heterocycle isoalloxazine . The biochemical source is the vitamin riboflavin . The flavin moiety is often attached with an adenosine diphosphate to form flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) , and , in other circumstances , is found as flavin mononucleotide ( or FMN ) , a phosphorylated form of riboflavin . It is in one or the other of these forms that flavin is present as a prosthetic group in flavoproteins . The flavin group is capable of undergoing oxidation-reduction reactions , and can accept either one electron in a two-step process or two electrons at once . Reduction is made with the addition of hydrogen atoms to specific nitrogen atoms on the isoalloxazine ring system :",
  "/wiki/Anthranilic_acid": "Anthranilic acid is an aromatic acid with the formula C6H4 ( NH2 ) ( CO2H ) and has a sweetish taste . The molecule consists of a benzene ring , ortho-substituted with a carboxylic acid and an amine . As a result of containing both acidic and basic functional groups , the compound is amphoteric . Anthranilic acid is a white solid when pure , although commercial samples may appear yellow . The anion [ C6H4 ( NH2 ) ( CO2 ) ] \u2212 , obtained by the deprotonation of anthranilic acid , is called anthranilate . Anthranilic acid was once thought to be a vitamin and was referred to as vitamin L1 in that context , but it is now known to be non-essential in human nutrition .",
  "/wiki/Adenylthiomethylpentose": "Adenylthiomethylpentose is a sulfur-containing nucleoside that was formerly known as vitamin L2 . In 1912 , an adenine nucleoside was isolated by Hunter et al . from yeast that were grown without phosphorus or sulfur . Later that substance was shown by Levene and Sobotkal to be adenylthiomethylpentose . In 1936 , W. Nakahara et al . did experiments on rats that suggested that vitamin L2 deficiency inhibits the ability of rats to lactate . In 1942 they identified vitamin L2 to be adenylthiomethylpentose . Later studies by Folley et al refuted Nakahara 's claims and demonstrated that L2 is not necessary for lactation and thus L2 is not considered a vitamin today . Hecht found in 1937 that the body temperature of rabbits , cats and guinea pigs were lowered by 1 to 2 degrees after he gave them adenylthiomethylpentose at a dose of 0.2 g/kg . K\u00fchn et al . replicated this in guinea pigs in 1941 .",
  "/wiki/Folate": "Folate , also known as vitamin B9 and folacin , is one of the B vitamins . Manufactured folic acid , which is converted into folate by the body , is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage . Folate is essential for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids , which are required for cell division . As humans can not make folate , it is required in the diet , making it an essential vitamin . It occurs naturally in many foods . The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements . Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate deficiency . Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) in the baby . Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs . More than 80 countries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs . Long-term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid is associated with small reduction in the risk of stroke and an increased risk of prostate cancer . There are concerns that large amounts of supplemental folic acid can hide vitamin B12 deficiency .",
  "/wiki/Flavonoids": "Flavonoids ( or bioflavonoids ) ( from the Latin word flavus , meaning yellow , their color in nature ) are a class of polyphenolic plant and fungus secondary metabolites . Chemically , flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton , which consists of two phenyl rings ( A and B ) and a heterocyclic ring ( C ) . This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6 . According to the IUPAC nomenclature , they can be classified into :",
  "/wiki/Niacin": "Niacin , also known as nicotinic acid , is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3 , an essential human nutrient . It has the formula C6H5NO2 and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acid . Niacin is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods , with highest contents in fortified packaged foods , tuna , salmon , some vegetable and other animal sources . Some countries require its addition to grains . Supplemental niacin is primarily used to treat high blood cholesterol and pellagra ( niacin deficiency ) . Insufficient amounts of niacin can cause nausea , skin and mouth lesions , anemia , headaches , and tiredness . This lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency diseases , which are caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins ( niacin , vitamin C , thiamin , vitamin D , and vitamin A ) and are usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition . Niacin supplementation has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin , but appears to be effective in those not taking a statin . Although niacin and nicotinamide ( niacinamide ) are identical in their vitamin activity , nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects ( lipid-modifying effects ) as niacin . When niacin takes on the -amide group , it does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing . As the precursor for NAD and NADP , niacin is also involved in DNA repair . In 2016 it was the 277th most prescribed medication in the United States with more than a million prescriptions .",
  "/wiki/Salicylic_acid": "Salicylic acid ( from Latin salix , willow tree ) is a lipophilic monohydroxybenzoic acid , a type of phenolic acid , and a beta hydroxy acid ( BHA ) . It has the formula C7H6O3 . This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone . It is derived from the metabolism of salicin . In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) , which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid , it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products . The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .",
  "/wiki/S-Methylmethionine": "S-Methylmethionine ( SMM ) is a derivative of methionine with the chemical formula ( CH3 ) 2S+CH2CH2CH ( NH3+ ) CO2\u2212 . This cation is an intermediate in many biosynthetic pathways owing to the sulfonium functional group . The natural derivative S-methylmethionine is biosynthesized from L-methionine which is first converted to S-adenosylmethionine . The subsequent conversion , involving replacement of the adenosyl group by a methyl group is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine S-methyltransferase . S-methylmethionine is particularly abundant in plants , being more abundant than methionine . S-Methylmethionine is sometimes referred to as vitamin U , but it is not considered a true vitamin . The term was coined in 1950 by Garnett Cheney for uncharacterized anti-ulcerogenic factors in raw cabbage juice that may help speed healing of peptic ulcers ."
