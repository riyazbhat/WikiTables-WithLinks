  "/wiki/Tanzania": "Tanzania ( /\u02cct\u00e6nz\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0\u0259/ , [ note 2 ] Swahili : [ tanza\u02c8ni.a ] ) , officially the United Republic of Tanzania ( Swahili : Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania ) , is a country in East Africa within the African Great Lakes region . It borders Uganda to the north ; Kenya to the northeast ; Comoro Islands and the Indian Ocean to the east ; Mozambique and Malawi to the south ; Zambia to the southwest ; and Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They subsequently migrated across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago . German rule began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa .",

The previous school name was \u00c9cole Nationale de l'Industrie Min\u00e9rale ( or National School of the Mineral Industry in English ) . Based in Rabat , Mines Rabat is one of the oldest engineering schools in Morocco . Mines Rabat is a member of the Conf\u00e9rence des grandes \u00e9coles ( CGE ) . The course for the engineering program lasts three years and the admission is done mainly by the common national competition ( CNC ) after making two or three years in preparatory classes . Despite its small size ( fewer than 300 students are accepted each year , after a very selective exam ) , it is a crucial part of the infrastructure of Moroccan industry . The Mines Rabat is often compared at the Mines ParisTech in France . In the limit of available places candidates can be admitted to this title and by level :",

Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg , opposite Sal\u00e9 , the city 's main commuter town . Rabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min as a military town . The city steadily grew but went into an extended period of decline following the collapse of the Almohads . In the 17th century Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates .

Rabat , Temara , and Sal\u00e9 form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people . Silt-related problems have diminished Rabat 's role as a port ; however , Rabat , and Sal\u00e9 still maintain important textile , food processing and construction industries . In addition , tourism and the presence of all foreign embassies in Morocco serve to make Rabat one of the most important cities in the country .

It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west , with land border with Algeria to the east and Western Sahara to the south ( status disputed ) . Morocco also claims the exclaves of Ceuta , Melilla and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera , all of them under Spanish jurisdiction , as well as several small Spanish-controlled islands of its coast . The capital is Rabat and the largest city is Casablanca . Morocco spans an area of 710,850 km2 ( 274,460 sq mi ) and has a population of over 36 million . Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",
