This elegant bowstring reinforced concrete arch bridge represents a traditional bridge type which was readily adapted to what was essentially a new construction material : reinforced concrete .

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 . Merchants from the city of Baltimore , which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century , wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal ( which served New York City ) , another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania ( which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh ) , the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ( which connected to the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. ) , and the James River Canal , which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk , Virginia . At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network . The B & O also includes the Leiper Railroad , the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970 , the B & O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track , not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit ( SIRT ) or the Reading and its subsidiaries .",
