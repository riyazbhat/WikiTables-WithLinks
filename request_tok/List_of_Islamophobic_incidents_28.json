  "/wiki/Buddhists": "Buddhism ( /\u02c8b\u028ad\u026az\u0259m/ , US : /\u02c8bu\u02d0d-/ ) is the world 's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers , or over 7% of the global population , known as Buddhists . [ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia . Vajrayana , a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts , may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism . Tibetan Buddhism , which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India , is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region , Mongolia , and Kalmykia .",

By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23% of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24% of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . Envious of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain , the dominant colonial power in North America . It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company 's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 .

Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla , while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as j\u0101mi\u02bf .

Religious violence , like all violence , is a cultural process that is context-dependent and very complex . Oversimplifications of religion and violence often lead to misguided understandings of causes for why some people commit acts of violence and why people most do not commit such acts in the first place .

  "/wiki/Ethnic_riot": "Ethnic violence is a form of political violence expressly motivated by ethnic hatred and ethnic conflict . Forms of ethnic violence which can be argued to have the character of terrorism may be known as ethnic terrorism or ethnically-motivated terrorism . Racist terrorism is a form of ethnic violence dominated by overt racism and xenophobic reactionism . Ethnic violence in an organized , sustained form is known as ethnic conflict or warfare ( race war ) , in contrast to class conflict , where the dividing line is social class rather than ethnic background . Care must be taken to distinguish ethnic violence , which is violence motivated by an ethnic division , from violence that just happens to break out between groups of different ethnicity motivated by other factors ( political or ideological ) . Violent ethnic rivalry is the subject matter of Jewish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz 's Der Rassenkampf ( Struggle of the Races , 1909 ) ; and more recently of Amy Chua 's notable study , : How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability . Some academics would place all nationalist-based violence under ethnic violence , which would include the World Wars and all major conflicts between industrialised nations during the 19th century .",

The island is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait . The legislative capital , Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , is a suburb of the commercial capital and largest city , Colombo . Sri Lanka 's documented history spans 3,000 years , with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years . It has a rich cultural heritage , and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka , the P\u0101li Canon , date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC . Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road . Sri Lanka was known in the west and from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon ( /s\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ , US also /se\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ ) . A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence , which was granted in 1948 ; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972 . Sri Lanka 's recent history has been marred by a 26-year civil war , which ended decisively when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in 2009 . The current constitution stipulates the political system as a republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system . It has had a long history of international engagement , as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , and a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the G77 , and the Non-Aligned Movement . Along with the Maldives , Sri Lanka is one of only two South Asian countries rated high on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , with its HDI rating and per capita income the highest among South Asian nations .",

Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists . However , by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution , religious rights of all communities are preserved . Sri Lanka is the traditionally oldest religious Buddhist country where Buddhist Aryan culture is protected and preserved . The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast P\u0101li Canon . Throughout most of its history , Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island . During the 19th century , a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning . There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks .",
