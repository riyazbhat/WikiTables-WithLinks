  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

It was a replacement for the Make build tool of Unix , and was created due to a number of problems with Unix 's make . It is similar to Make but is implemented using the Java language , requires the Java platform , and is best suited to building Java projects . The most immediately noticeable difference between Ant and Make is that Ant uses XML to describe the code build process and its dependencies , whereas Make uses the Makefile format . By default , the XML file is named build.xml . Released under an Apache License by the Apache Software Foundation , Ant is an open-source project .",

The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity , generality , and usability across the Internet . It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages . Although the design of XML focuses on documents , the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services .

Initially a Windows component only , known as Windows PowerShell , it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core . The former is built on .NET Framework while the latter on .NET Core . In PowerShell , administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets ( pronounced command-lets ) , which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation . These work by accessing data in different data stores , like the file system or registry , which are made available to PowerShell via providers . Third-party developers can add cmdlets and providers to PowerShell . Cmdlets may be used by scripts and scripts may be packaged into modules . PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI , enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote Linux systems and network devices . PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications . These applications can then use PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations , including those exposed via the graphical interface . This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets . Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets .",
