  "/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Baden": "The Grand Duchy of Baden ( German : Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden ) was a state in the southwest German Empire on the east bank of the Rhine . It existed between 1806 and 1918 . It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines , which were unified in 1771 . It then became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803-1806 and was a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871 , remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden . Baden was bordered to the north by the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt ; to the west , along most of its length , by the river Rhine , which separated Baden from the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate and Alsace in modern France ; to the south by Switzerland ; and to the east by the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Bavaria . After World War II , the French military government in 1945 created the state of Baden ( originally known as South Baden ) out of the southern half of the former Baden , with Freiburg as its capital . This portion of the former Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden . The northern half of the old Baden was combined with northern W\u00fcrttemberg , becoming part of the American military zone , and formed the state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden . Both Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden became states of West Germany upon its formation in 1949 . In 1952 Baden merged with W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern ( southern W\u00fcrttemberg and the former Prussian exclave of Hohenzollern ) to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg . This is the only merger of states that has taken place in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany . The unofficial anthem of Baden is called Badnerlied ( Song of the People of Baden ) and consists of four or five traditional verses .",
  "/wiki/Margraviate": "Margrave was originally the medieval title for the military commander assigned to maintain the defence of one of the border provinces of the Holy Roman Empire or of a kingdom . That position became hereditary in certain feudal families in the Empire , and the title came to be borne by rulers of some Imperial principalities until the abolition of the Empire in 1806 ( e.g. , Margrave of Brandenburg , Margrave of Baden ) . Thereafter , those domains ( originally known as marks or marches , later as margraviates or margravates ) were absorbed in larger realms or the titleholders adopted titles indicative of full sovereignty .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria": "The Kingdom of Bavaria ( German : K\u00f6nigreich Bayern ; Austro-Bavarian : Kinereich Bayern ) was a German state that succeeded the former Electorate of Bavaria in 1805 and continued to exist until 1918 . The Bavarian Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of the House of Wittelsbach became the first King of Bavaria in 1805 as Maximilian I Joseph . The crown would go on being held by the Wittelsbachs until the kingdom came to an end in 1918 . Most of Bavaria 's present-day borders were established after 1814 with the Treaty of Paris , in which Bavaria ceded Tyrol and Vorarlberg to the Austrian Empire while receiving Aschaffenburg and W\u00fcrzburg . With the unification of Germany into the German Empire in 1871 , the kingdom became a federal state of the new Empire and was second in size , power , and wealth only to the leading state , the Kingdom of Prussia . In 1918 , Bavaria became a republic , and the kingdom was thus succeeded by the current Free State of Bavaria .",
  "/wiki/Duchy": "A duchy is a medieval country , territory , fief , or domain ruled by a duke or duchess , a high-ranking nobleman hierarchically second to the king or queen in European tradition . The term is used almost exclusively in Europe , where in the present day there is no sovereign duchy ( i.e . with the status of a nation state ) left . The term duke ( like the corresponding duchy ) should not be confused with the title Grand Duke ( or Grand Duchy , such as the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ) , as there exists a significant difference of rank between the two . In common European cultural heritage , a grand duke is the third highest monarchic rank , after emperor and king . Its synonym in many Slavic and Baltic European languages ( Russian , Lithuanian , etc . ) is translated as Grand Prince , whereas most Germanic and Romance European languages ( English , French , Spanish , Italian etc . ) use expressions corresponding to Grand Duke . Unlike a duke , the sovereign grand duke is considered royalty ( or in German , 'royal nobility ' , K\u00f6nigsadel ) . The proper form of address for a grand duke is His Royal Highness ( HRH ) , whereas for a non-royal duke in the United Kingdom it is His Grace . In contrast to this , the rank of a duke differs from one country to the next . In Germany , for example , a duke is listed in the aristocratic hierarchy below an emperor ( Kaiser ) , king ( K\u00f6nig ) , grand duke ( Gro\u00dfherzog ) , and elector ( Kurf\u00fcrst ) - in that order - whereas in Britain the duke comes third after king/queen and prince ( there are no British grand dukes or electors ) .",
  "/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Berg": "The Grand Duchy of Berg ( German : Gro\u00dfherzogtum Berg ) , also known as the Grand Duchy of Berg and Cleves , was a territorial grand duchy established in 1806 by Emperor Napoleon after his victory at the Battle of Austerlitz ( 1805 ) on territories between the French Empire at the Rhine river and the German Kingdom of Westphalia .",
  "/wiki/Duchy_of_Cleves": "The Duchy of Cleves ( German : Herzogtum Kleve ; Dutch : Hertogdom Kleef ) was a State of the Holy Roman Empire which emerged from the medieval Hettergau [ de ] . It was situated in the northern Rhineland on both sides of the Lower Rhine , around its capital Cleves and the towns of Wesel , Kalkar , Xanten , Emmerich , Rees and Duisburg bordering the lands of the Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster in the east and the Duchy of Brabant in the west . Its history is closely related to that of its southern neighbours : the Duchies of J\u00fclich and Berg , as well as Guelders and the Westphalian county of Mark . The Duchy was archaically known as Cleveland in English . The duchy 's territory roughly covered the present-day German districts of Cleves ( northern part ) , Wesel and the city of Duisburg , as well as adjacent parts of the Limburg , North Brabant and Gelderland provinces in the Netherlands .",
  "/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Hesse": "The Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine ( German : Gro\u00dfherzogtum Hessen und bei Rhein ) was a grand duchy in western Germany that existed from 1806 ( the period of German mediatization ) to the end of the German Empire in 1918 . The grand duchy originally formed on the basis of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1806 as the Grand Duchy of Hesse ( German : Gro\u00dfherzogtum Hessen ) . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , it changed its name in 1816 to distinguish itself from the Electorate of Hesse , which had formed from neighboring Hesse-Kassel . Colloquially , the grand duchy continued to be known by its former name of Hesse-Darmstadt . It joined the German Empire in 1871 and became a republic after German defeat in World War I in 1918 .",
  "/wiki/Landgrave": "Landgrave ( German : Landgraf , Dutch : landgraaf , Swedish : lantgreve , French : landgrave ; Latin : comes magnus , comes patriae , comes provinciae , comes terrae , comes principalis , lantgravius ) was a noble title used in the Holy Roman Empire , and later on in its former territories . The German titles of Landgraf , Markgraf ( margrave ) , and Pfalzgraf ( count palatine ) are in the same class of ranks as Herzog ( duke ) and above the rank of a Graf ( count ) .",
  "/wiki/Principality_of_Regensburg": "The Principality of Regensburg ( German : F\u00fcrstentum Regensburg ) was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire created in 1803 ; following the dissolution of the Empire in 1806 , it was part of the Confederation of the Rhine until 1810 . Its capital was Regensburg .",
  "/wiki/Prince-Archbishop": "A prince-bishop is a bishop who is also the civil ruler of some secular principality and sovereignty . Thus the principality or prince-bishopric ruled politically by a prince-bishop could wholly or largely overlap with his diocesan jurisdiction , since some parts of his diocese , even the city of his residence , could be exempt from his civil rule , obtaining the status of free imperial city . If the episcopal see is an archbishop , the correct term is prince-archbishop ; the equivalent in the regular ( monastic ) clergy is prince-abbot . A prince-bishop is usually considered an elected monarch . In the West , with the decline of imperial power from the 4th century onwards in the face of the barbarian invasions , sometimes Christian bishops of cities took the place of the Roman commander , made secular decisions for the city and led their own troops when necessary . Later relations between a prince-bishop and the burghers were invariably not cordial . As cities demanded charters from emperors , kings , or their prince-bishops and declared themselves independent of the secular territorial magnates , friction intensified between burghers and bishops . In the Byzantine Empire , the still autocratic Emperors passed general legal measures assigning all bishops certain rights and duties in the secular administration of their dioceses , possibly as part of a development to put the Eastern Church in the service of the Empire [ citation needed ] , with its Ecumenical Patriarch almost reduced to the Emperor 's minister of religious affairs .",
  "/wiki/Prince-Elector": "The Prince-electors ( German : Kurf\u00fcrst ( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ) , pl . Kurf\u00fcrsten , Czech : Kurfi\u0159t , Latin : Princeps Elector ) of the Holy Roman Empire , or Electors for short , were the members of the electoral college that elected the Holy Roman Emperor . From the 13th century onwards , the Prince-Electors had the privilege of electing the monarch who would receive the coronation at the hands of the Pope . After 1508 , the election was sufficient to acquire the Imperial title without Papal coronation . Charles V was the last person to be a crowned Emperor ( elected 1519 , crowned 1530 ) ; his successors were only elected Emperors by the electoral college , each being titled Elected Emperor of the Romans ( German : erw\u00e4hlter R\u00f6mischer Kaiser ; Latin : electus Romanorum imperator ) . In practice , election by the princely electoral college was merely a de jure requirement . De facto the Imperial throne followed the order of succession of the Austrian House of Habsburg : every emperor from 1440 onwards came from the House of Austria except for Charles VII ( r. 1742-1745 ) and Francis I ( r. 1745-1765 ) , both of whom were related to the Habsburgs by blood or marriage . In the end , the Electors merely ratified such inheritance . The dignity of Elector carried great prestige and was considered to be second only to that of King or Emperor . The Electors held exclusive privileges that were not shared with other princes of the Empire , and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of Elector . The heir apparent to a secular prince-elector was known as an electoral prince ( German : Kurprinz ) .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Westphalia": "The Kingdom of Westphalia was a kingdom in Germany , with a population of 2.6 million , that existed from 1807 to 1813 . It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany . While formally independent , it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon 's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte . It was named after Westphalia , but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area ; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia . Napoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany , a French-style central administration , and agricultural reform . The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial . In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany 's first laws granting Jews equal rights , thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states . Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms . The country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers . Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned . The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812 . When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813 , the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and ( in 1815 ) most of its territories became Prussian ruled .",

He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history , and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon 's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history . He was born Napoleone Buonaparte ( Italian : [ napole\u02c8o\u02d0ne \u02ccbw\u0254na\u02c8parte ] ) in Corsica to a relatively modest Italian family from minor nobility . He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789 . He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24 . The French Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed the 13 Vend\u00e9miaire revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs - winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing sister republics with local support , and becoming a war hero in France . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power .",

The kingdom was a continuation of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg , which existed from 1495 to 1805 .

As a consequence of the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville , the Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg was secularized in 1803 and granted to the Electorate of Bavaria . In the same year Ferdinand III , former Grand Duke of Tuscany , was compensated with the Electorate of Salzburg . In the Peace of Pressburg of 26 December 1805 , Ferdinand lost Salzburg to the Austrian Empire but was compensated with the W\u00fcrzburg territory , Bavaria having relinquished it in return for Tyrol . Ferdinand 's state was briefly known as the Electorate of W\u00fcrzburg ( Kurf\u00fcrstentum W\u00fcrzburg ) , but it was elevated to the status of a Grand Duchy after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire on 6 August 1806 . It joined the Confederation of the Rhine on 30 September 1806 . In 1810 it acquired Schweinfurt . After Napoleon 's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig , Ferdinand dissolved his alliance with the First French Empire on 26 October 1813 . Through an Austrian-Bavarian treaty of 3 June 1814 , Ferdinand lost his possessions to the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy was dissolved . Ferdinand was restored to a reconstituted Grand Duchy of Tuscany by the Congress of Vienna . The Roman Catholic Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg was reestablished in 1821 without temporal power ."
