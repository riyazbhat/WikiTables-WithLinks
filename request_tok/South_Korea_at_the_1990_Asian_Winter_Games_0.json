Yang Yang ( A ) crossed the line together with Chun in what was ruled and reviewed as a photo finish , but was then disqualified for cross tracking Chun at the very end as Chun tried to pass on the inside ( although the photo finish seemed to show Chun having defeated her for the gold regardless ) . She led the relay team to another Olympic victory with world record time , completing the first double-double in Olympic short track history",
