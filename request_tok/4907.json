  "/wiki/Heard_'Em_Say": "Heard 'Em Say is a song by American hip-hop recording artist and record producer Kanye West . It was included as the opening song on the track-listing of his second studio album Late Registration ( 2005 ) . The track was produced by West with Jon Brion and contains excerpts of Someone That I Used To Love as performed by Natalie Cole . The song features a guest appearance from Adam Levine , lead vocalist of the American funk rock band Maroon 5 . West and Levine met for the first time and forged a friendship during a flight to Rome set for the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards . West introduced himself to Levine and played tracks from his forthcoming sophomore album on his iPod . When they came across a demo for Heard 'Em Say , the singer had ready an unused chorus he 'd written for his band that he felt was perfect for it . The two artists decided to collaborate , working together to write the song on the same plane . The song harbors a soothing lullaby tone and retains moody atmosphere . It features soulful undertones , containing an R & B chorus as well as elements of art rock . The track 's subdued instrumentation has a cascading piano line dressed over tumbling delayed beats laced with warped bass synth and a subtle interjection of acoustic guitar . Lyrically , Heard 'Em Say imparts contemplative moral soliloquies touching on social issues .",
