  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms",

  "/wiki/Handheld_game_console": "A handheld game console , or simply handheld console , is a small , portable self-contained video game console with a built-in screen , game controls , and speakers . Handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console , screen , speakers , and controls in one unit , allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place . In 1976 , Mattel introduced the first handheld electronic game with the release of Auto Race . Later , several companies - including Coleco and Milton Bradley - made their own single-game , lightweight table-top or handheld electronic game devices . The oldest true handheld game console with interchangeable cartridges is the Milton Bradley Microvision in 1979 . Nintendo is credited with popularizing the handheld console concept with the release of the Game Boy in 1989 and continues to dominate the handheld console market",
  "/wiki/RuneScape": "RuneScape , sometimes referred to as RuneScape 3 , is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game ( MMORPG ) developed and published by Jagex , first released in January 2001 .

The game has had over 200 million accounts created and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world 's largest and most-updated free MMORPG . RuneScape takes place in the world of Gielinor , a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms , regions , and cities . Players can travel throughout Gielinor via a number of methods including on foot , magical spells , or charter ships . Each region offers different types of monsters , resources , and quests to challenge players . The game 's fictional universe has also been explored through a tie-in video game on another of its maker 's websites , FunOrb , Armies of Gielinor , and the novels Betrayal at Falador , Return to Canifis , and Legacy of Blood . Players are represented in the game with customisable avatars . RuneScape does not follow a linear storyline ; rather , players set their own goals and objectives . Players can choose to fight non-player character ( NPC ) monsters , complete quests , or increase their experience in the available skills . Players interact with each other through trading , chatting , or by participating in mini-games and activities , some of which are competitive or combative in nature , while others require cooperative or collaborative play . The first public version of RuneScape was released in January 2001 in beta form , with Jagex as its copyright holder being formed later that year",

Although it was originally designed for a family audience , the game was retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare 's earlier platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 . Upon release , Conker 's Bad Fur Day was acclaimed by video game critics , who praised its visual appeal and smart , funny humour . The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64 's life cycle , but has since earned a cult following . A remake , Conker : Live & Reloaded , was released for the Xbox in 2005 . In 2015 , the game was included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One",

The game tells the story of three bouncers in the fictional city of Edge on a rescue mission to save their young friend from the Mikado Group , a solar technology megacorporation owned by the megalomaniacal Dauragon C. Mikado . The game is structured like a playable action movie , with the plot unfolding differently depending on which character the player chooses for specific gameplay sequences . The Bouncer was Square 's first game on the PlayStation 2 , and although it received considerable press coverage before its release , and was greatly anticipated as one of the marquee titles in the first batch of PS2 games , it was met with poor sales and mixed reviews",
  "/wiki/Sonic_Shuffle": "Sonic Shuffle [ a ] is a Sonic the Hedgehog-themed party game developed and published by Sega for the Dreamcast in 2000 . The game plays like a board game much in the same vein as Nintendo 's Mario Party series , with up to four players moving their characters across a game board filled with a variety of spaces which can trigger different events . Some spaces will launch minigames that pit the players against each other in short competitive events . Sega contracted Hudson Soft , the developers of Mario Party , to assist with development . For the game 's graphics , they used the same cel shading technique used in their earlier game , Jet Set Radio ( 2000 ) . An online multiplayer mode was planned , but it was pulled so the game could launch in time for the 2000 holiday season . Although critics praised the graphics , the game 's excessive load times and poorly explained , overly complex minigames were found to be significantly detrimental to the overall experience . Critics classified Sonic Shuffle as an inferior clone of Mario Party",
