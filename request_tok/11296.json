Rather than breaking new ground with his designs , Pflueger captured the spirit of the times and refined it , adding a distinct personal flair . His work influenced later architects such as Pietro Belluschi . Pflueger , who started as a working-class draftsman and never went to college , established his imprint on the development of Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne , neo-Mayan , Beaux-Arts , Mission Revival , Neoclassical and International . His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces , including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel , the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont , three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day . Pflueger 's social and business connections spanned the city , including three private men 's clubs which he joined : the Bohemian Club , the Olympic Club and The Family .

It was the tallest building in San Francisco from 1927 to 1964 and one of the most prominent , along with its 133-metre ( 436 ft ) twin , the PacBell Building to the south . Upon completion , the building was iconic enough that Architect and Engineer wrote , In nearly every large city there is one building that because of its size , beauty of architectural design and character of its use and occupancy , has come to typify the city itself . Today the Russ Building takes this place in San Francisco . By its size and location and by the character of its tenants the building becomes indeed - 'The Center of Western Progress ' . However , Manhattanization from 1960 to 1990 has shrouded the tower in a shell of skyscrapers , removing the tower 's prominence .

The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California , although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada . The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera , a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of such ranges that form the western backbone of North America , Central America , South America and Antarctica . The Sierra runs 400 miles ( 640 km ) north-to-south , and is approximately 70 miles ( 110 km ) across east-to-west . Notable Sierra features include the General Sherman ( tree ) , the largest tree in the world by volume ; Lake Tahoe , the largest alpine lake in North America ; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft ( 4,421 m ) , the highest point in the contiguous United States ; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite , containing high waterfalls . The Sierra is home to three national parks , twenty wilderness areas , and two national monuments . These areas include Yosemite , Sequoia , and Kings Canyon National Parks ; and Devils Postpile National Monument . The character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology . More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny , granite formed deep underground . The range started to uplift four million years ago , and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range . The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada , which are reflected by the presence of five life zones ( areas with similar plant and animal communities ) . Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces , creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra .",

Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area , which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018 . Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles ( 1,651 km2 ) , Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States ( including consolidated city-counties ) . It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",

Meanwhile , Finn also supervised or designed buildings in various parts of Texas , including Brenham , Dallas , Galveston , Palestine , and Tyler . He continued architectural work for residential properties in the Houston area .

His public buildings included federal buildings , a college administration building and a complex of dormitories , and he designed the San Jacinto Monument .

Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California , Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune ; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh . Gulf 's former headquarters , originally referred to as the Gulf Building ( now the Gulf Tower office condos ) , is an Art Deco skyscraper . The tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970 , when it was eclipsed by the U.S. Steel Tower , it is capped by a step pyramid structure several stories high . Until 1973 , the entire top was illuminated , changing color with changes in barometric pressure to provide a weather indicator that could be seen for many miles . After 1973 until the 2000s , only a beacon on top would change colors . Gulf Oil Corporation ( GOC ) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985 , when it merged with Standard Oil of California ( SOCAL ) , with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States . Gulf Canada , Gulf 's main Canadian subsidiary , was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro-Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York .

  "/wiki/Sakowitz": "Sakowitz was a chain of family-owned department stores based in Houston , Texas , United States . The store was founded by two brothers , Tobias and Simon Sakowitz , in Galveston , Texas in 1902 . Other family members were working in the cotton mills in Galveston . The two brothers , Simon and Tobias , began a peddler business , taking orders and delivering clothes on a bicycle to the many merchant seamen in Galveston at that time . Eventually , the chain expanded to thirteen locations , of which ten were in Texas . L. J. Hooker , an Australian retail development firm , purchased the Sakowitz chain in 1988 so that a location could be opened at Forest Fair Mall ( now Cincinnati Mall ) in Forest Park , Ohio and Fairfield , Ohio . Due , in part , to the fact that Cincinnati was an untested market , the mall straddled two counties ( Hamilton and Butler ) and that the Australian real estate market tanked , Forest Fair Mall failed . The location of the complex was also in a very middle-class area and having both high and low end stores reside in the same mall proved to be too much . The Sakowitz chain was liquidated in 1990 and its stores closed . The Sakowitz name has survived in the form of Sakowitz Furs , a fur dealer with one store in Houston , owned by Jerry Gronauer .
