  "/wiki/Pre-law": "In the United States , pre-law refers to any course of study taken by an undergraduate in preparation for study at a law school . The American Bar Association requires law schools to admit only students with an accredited Bachelor 's Degree or its equivalent depending on the student 's country of origin . However , there are no specific pre-law degree or majors , and unlike pre-med , an undergraduate student seeking legal education in the United States is not required to take a set of prerequisites in order to apply . Hence , most undergraduate institutions do not offer an official pre-law concentration , and in some cases provide somewhat equivalents such as Law , Society and Justice instead . Students awarded with Bachelor of Arts , Bachelor of Science or equivalent degrees ( and more rarely , higher degrees such as the master 's degree and doctorate ) may apply for law schools as long as they meet specific admission requirements set forth by individual law schools , as well as the standard requirements ( such as character and fitness ) as set forth by the ABA and the Law School Admission Council . In 2001 , the five most common majors of students entering law school were political science , history , English , psychology , and criminal justice . The five majors with the highest acceptance rates were physics , philosophy , biology , chemistry , and government service . A pre-law program is sometimes offered at some American colleges and universities ; however , it is considered to be a track that follows a certain curriculum . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",
  "/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

  "/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)": "The Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States of America . Alongside the Democratic Party , it was one of the two major parties in the United States during the late 1830s , the 1840s , and the early 1850s , part of the Second Party System . Four U.S. presidents were affiliated with the Whig party for at least part of their respective terms . Other influential party leaders include Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , William Seward , John J. Crittenden , and Truman Smith . The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson , pulling together former members of the National Republican Party , the Anti-Masonic Party , and disaffected Democrats . The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party , but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders , including Clay , had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party . In the 1836 presidential election , four different Whig candidates received electoral votes , but the party failed to defeat Jackson 's chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election , but died just one month into his term . Harrison 's successor , John Tyler , was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank . Clay won his party 's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk , who subsequently presided over the Mexican-American War . Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election , but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore . Fillmore , Clay , Daniel Webster , and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850 , which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War .",

In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s .
