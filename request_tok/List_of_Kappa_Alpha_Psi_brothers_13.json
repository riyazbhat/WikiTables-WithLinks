The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States .

Dallas became the first team to win three Super Bowls in four years , while Pittsburgh 's defeat was their first Super Bowl loss in team history . Dallas ' Larry Brown , a 12th-round draft pick , became the first cornerback to be named Super Bowl MVP by recording two interceptions in the second half , which the Cowboys converted into two touchdowns to prevent a Steelers comeback . Dallas built a 13-0 lead in the second quarter before Pittsburgh scored with 13 seconds left in the half to cut their deficit to 13-7 . Midway through the 3rd quarter , Brown made his first interception and returned it 44 yards to the Pittsburgh 18-yard line to set up running back Emmitt Smith 's 1-yard touchdown run . The Steelers then rallied to cut their deficit to 20-17 in the 4th quarter ."
