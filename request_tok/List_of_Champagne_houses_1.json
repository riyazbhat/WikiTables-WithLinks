Its primary river , the Vesle , is a tributary of the Aisne . Founded by the Gauls , Reims became a major city during the period of the Roman Empire . Reims later played a prominent ceremonial role in French monarchical history as the traditional site of the coronation of the kings of France . The royal anointing was performed at the Cathedral of Reims , which housed the Holy Ampulla of chrism allegedly brought by a white dove at the baptism of Frankish king Clovis I in 496 . For this reason , Reims is often referred to in French as la cit\u00e9 des sacres ( the Coronation City ) . The Cathedral , the Palace of Tau and the former Abbey of Saint-Remi have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991 .",
