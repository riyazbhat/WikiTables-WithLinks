Gamera first appeared in Noriaki Yuasa 's 1965 film Gamera , the Giant Monster , produced by Daiei Film .

Gamera is depicted a massive , fire-breathing , prehistoric monster resembling a turtle , mutated by exposure to nuclear weapons .

As the film series progressed , Gamera took on a more benevolent role , becoming a protecter of humanity , and especially of human children , from extraterrestrial races and other giant monsters . In the United States , Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e showcases like Creature Double Feature , and later in the 1990s when five Gamera films were featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000",
