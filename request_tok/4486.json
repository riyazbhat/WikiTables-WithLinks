  "/wiki/Dumb_Patrol": "Dumb Patrol is a Looney Tunes cartoon short released January 18 , 1964 , starring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam with a cameo appearance by Porky Pig . This cartoon short was directed by Gerry Chiniquy , a longtime animator in Friz Freleng 's unit . It is set during World War I opening 'somewhere in France ' in 1917 . The title is an allusion to The Dawn Patrol , a 1930 movie by Howard Hawks that also deals with World War I pilots . The same title was also used for an unrelated , early Looney Tunes short starring Bosko , released in 1931 . Dumb Patrol does not fall into the normal pattern found in most other Bugs Bunny cartoon shorts . Bugs is not disturbed from a serene state as in most of his other shorts . Also , he is the attacker , reversing his normal role of the victim . Yosemite Sam had previously been killed off in his previous short , Devil 's Feud Cake ( though because this film is set in the past it does not create an explicit continuity error ) . This marks the final pairing of Bugs and Yosemite Sam , as well as the final appearance of the latter , one of the only 3 cartoons to feature both Bugs and Porky together , and the final time Porky appears without Daffy Duck .",

The film marks a significant shift in Daffy 's personality , going from being the insane screwball character who ( like Bugs ) overwhelmed his adversaries , to being a much more flawed individual , full of greed and vanity and desiring for attention under the spotlight . This personality change , which was previously explored by Jones in You Were Never Duckier and Daffy Dilly , and even earlier in Friz Freleng 's You Ought to Be in Pictures , was done in order for Daffy to better serve as Bugs ' foil . This was fueled by Bugs ' popularity surpassing Daffy 's quickly over the years , increasing the desire of the studio 's animators to pair the two together .
