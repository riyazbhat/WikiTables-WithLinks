  "/wiki/Holden_LJ_Torana_GTR_XU-1": "The Holden Torana is a mid-sized car manufactured by Holden from 1967 to 1980 . The name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning to fly . The original HB series Torana was released in 1967 and was a four-cylinder compact vehicle closely based on the British Vauxhall Viva HB series of 1966 - 1970 . Whilst the 1969-73 ( LC and LJ series ) cars included more popular , longer-wheelbase six-cylinder versions , and with the 1974-77 ( LH and LX series ) cars adding eight-cylinder versions to the mix , a range of four-cylinder versions continued for the entire production life of the Torana ( with later four-cylinder versions being marketed as the Holden Sunbird from November 1976 ) . In South Korea , the LJ Torana was produced locally as the Chevrolet 1700 ( \uc2dc\ubcf4\ub808 1700 , 1972-1978 ) and Saehan Camina ( \uc0c8\ud55c \uce74\ubbf8\ub098 , 1976-1978 ) . Changing tack in Australian motor sport , Holden released the LC Torana GTR XU-1 in 1970 , with performance-enhanced drivetrain and handling . From this time through to the release of the Holden Commodore , the Torana remained Holden 's most successful sports/performance vehicle , with many victories garnered in rallying and circuit racing . The introduction of the VB Commodore in 1978 was preceded by the arrival of the updated UC Torana/Sunbird twins , but with no sports versions or V8 engine options . The Torana was subsequently discontinued in 1979 , followed by the four-cylinder Sunbird in 1980 .",

  "/wiki/Chrysler_Valiant_Charger_R/T_E49": "The Chrysler Valiant Charger was a two door hardtop coupe introduced by Chrysler Australia in 1971 . It was a short wheelbase version of the concurrent Australian Chrysler Valiant sedan . Introduced within the VH Valiant series , it continued as a variant through the subsequent VJ , VK and CL series , until production ceased in 1978 . It was marketed and badged as the Valiant Charger in the VH and VJ series and as the Chrysler Charger in the later VK and CL series . While still based on the US Chrysler A-body platform , with virtually identical front suspension , the fenders were widened , and a wider rear axle fitted , so that the track , front and rear , was considerably wider than any US A-body , this also allowed wheels much wider than a US A-body . The Australian Chargers also used a 5-on-4.5 wheel bolt circle ( still 7/16 studs ) , while the US cars did not go to big bolt pattern until 1973 . The Charger was extraordinarily popular in Australia during the VH series . At one point Charger production totalled 80% of all Australian Valiant production . The VH Valiant Charger achieved critical acclaim , winning the 1971 Australian Wheels Car of the Year Award . It was also popular in New Zealand where they were assembled from imported kits . The sporty image of the Charger faded through the VJ range of cars and was neutered altogether by 1975 release of the VK series . During the seven years of production , the Charger carried many variations of essentially two basic powerplants , based on the Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine and versions of the Chrysler LA engine V8 .",
