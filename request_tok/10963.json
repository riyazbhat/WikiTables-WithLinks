  "/wiki/CBS": "CBS ( an initialism of the network 's former name , the Columbia Broadcasting System ) is an American English-language commercial broadcast television and radio network that is the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS . The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) . CBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network , in reference to the company 's trademark symbol , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the Tiffany Network , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
