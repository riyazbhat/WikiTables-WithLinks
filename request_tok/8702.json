  "/wiki/Real-time_strategy": "Real-time strategy ( RTS ) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns . This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing . In an RTS , the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents ' assets . In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources . These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose . More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge . Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments ; for example , the technique of clicking and dragging to select all units under a given area . Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template , recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games . For instance , city-building games , construction and management simulations , and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Games in this category are sometimes also called management games . SimCity represents an early example of success in the genre . Other games in the genre range from city-building games like Caesar or Dwarf Fortress , pure business simulation games like Capitalism , and true CMSs [ clarification needed ] like Theme Park . CMSs are often called simulation games for short . Although games can simulate many activities from vehicles to sports , players usually deduce the kind of simulation from the title of the game .",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .
