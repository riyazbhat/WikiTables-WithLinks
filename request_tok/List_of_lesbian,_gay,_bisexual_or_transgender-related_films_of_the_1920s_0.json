It was first released in 1919 and stars Conrad Veidt and Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel . The story was co-written by Richard Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld , who also had a small part in the film and partially funded the production through his Institute for Sexual Science . The film was intended as a polemic against the then-current laws under Germany 's Paragraph 175 , which made homosexuality a criminal offense . It is believed to be the first pro-gay film in the world . The cinematography was by Max Fassbender , who two years previously had worked on Das Bildnis des Dorian Gray , one of the earliest cinematic treatments of Oscar Wilde 's The Picture of Dorian Gray . Director Richard Oswald later became a director of more mainstream films , as did his son Gerd . Veidt became a major film star the year after Anders was released , in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . Anders als die Andern is one of the first sympathetic portrayals of homosexuals in cinema . The film 's basic plot was used again in the 1961 UK film , Victim , starring Dirk Bogarde .
