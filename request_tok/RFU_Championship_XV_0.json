  "/wiki/Captain_(sports)": "In team sport , captain is a title given to a member of the team .

In either case , it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one 's teammates - recognition as a leader by one 's peers . In association football and cricket , a captain is also known as a skipper . Various sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains . Depending on the sport , team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules . In many team sports , the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the coin toss at the beginning of the game . The team captain , in some sports , is selected by the team coach , who may consider factors ranging from playing ability to leadership to serving as a good moral example to the team . Coaches may also choose to change team captains from time to time , or to have a rotation of team captains . Some of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success . From Sam Walker in his book The Captain Class he states that a captain is the most important factor for a team 's success .",
