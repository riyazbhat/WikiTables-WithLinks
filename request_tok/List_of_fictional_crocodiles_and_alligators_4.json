  "/wiki/Fantasia_(1940_film)": "Fantasia is a 1940 American animated film produced by Walt Disney and released by Walt Disney Productions . With story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer , and production supervision by Ben Sharpsteen , it is the third Disney animated feature film . The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski , seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra . Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film 's Master of Ceremonies , providing a live-action introduction to each animated segment . Disney settled on the film 's concept as work neared completion on The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse , who had declined in popularity . As production costs grew higher than what it could earn , Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces . The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound , a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound . Fantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow held in thirteen U.S. cities from November 13 , 1940 . While acclaimed by critics , it was unable to make a profit due to World War II cutting off distribution to the European market , the film 's high production costs , and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations . The film was subsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio being deleted , modified , or restored in each version . Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. when adjusted for inflation .

Woody was originally voiced by prolific voice actor Mel Blanc , who was succeeded by Danny Webb , Kent Rogers , Ben Hardaway and finally Grace Stafford ( wife of Walter Lantz ) . Lantz produced theatrical cartoons longer than most of his contemporaries , and Woody Woodpecker remained a staple of Universal 's release schedule until 1972 , when Lantz finally closed down his studio . The character has been revived since then for special productions and occasions as well as for The New Woody Woodpecker Show , a late 1990s/early 2000s Fox Network Saturday-morning cartoon television series that featured prolific voice actor Billy West as Woody . Woody Woodpecker cartoons were first broadcast on television in 1957 under the title The Woody Woodpecker Show , which featured Lantz cartoons bookended by new footage of Woody and live-action footage of Lantz . Woody has a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 7000 Hollywood Boulevard . He also made a cameo appearance alongside many other famous cartoon characters in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit . Like Mickey Mouse of The Walt Disney Company and Bugs Bunny of Warner Bros. , Woody Woodpecker is the official mascot of Universal Studios .
