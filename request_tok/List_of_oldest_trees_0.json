The tree , which was at least 4,862 years old and possibly more than 5,000 , was cut down in 1964 by a graduate student and United States Forest Service personnel for research purposes . Those involved did not know of its world-record age before the cutting , but the circumstances and decision-making process remain controversial . The tree 's name refers to the mythological figure Prometheus , who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man .

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada 's people live in Clark County , which contains the Las Vegas-Paradise metropolitan area , including three of the state 's four largest incorporated cities . Nevada 's capital is Carson City . Nevada is officially known as the Silver State because of the importance of silver to its history and economy . It is also known as the Battle Born State because it achieved statehood during the Civil War ( the words Battle Born also appear on the state flag ) ; as the Sagebrush State , for the native plant of the same name ; and as the Sage-hen State . Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid , much of it within the Great Basin .

Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth . The common use of the name sequoia usually refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum , which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California . The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200-3,266 years old The etymology of the genus name has been presumed - initially in The Yosemite Book by Josiah Whitney in 1868 - to be in honor of Sequoyah ( 1767-1843 ) , who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary . An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that Austrian Stephen L. Endlicher is actually responsible for the name . A linguist and botanist , Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah , whom he admired . He also realized that coincidentally the genus could be described in Latin as sequi ( meaning to follow ) because the number of seeds per cone in the newly-classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder . Endlicher thus coined the name Sequoia as both a description of the tree 's genus and an honor to the indigenous man he admired",

The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California , although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada . The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera , a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of such ranges that form the western backbone of North America , Central America , South America and Antarctica . The Sierra runs 400 miles ( 640 km ) north-to-south , and is approximately 70 miles ( 110 km ) across east-to-west . Notable Sierra features include the General Sherman ( tree ) , the largest tree in the world by volume ; Lake Tahoe , the largest alpine lake in North America ; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft ( 4,421 m ) , the highest point in the contiguous United States ; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite , containing high waterfalls . The Sierra is home to three national parks , twenty wilderness areas , and two national monuments . These areas include Yosemite , Sequoia , and Kings Canyon National Parks ; and Devils Postpile National Monument . The character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology . More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny , granite formed deep underground . The range started to uplift four million years ago , and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range . The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada , which are reflected by the presence of five life zones ( areas with similar plant and animal communities ) . Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces , creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra",

With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of 2016 census , it is Canada 's fourth most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres ( 250,000 sq mi ) . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier is Jason Kenney as of April 30 , 2019 . Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper , Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise",
  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom",

As of 2018 , its total gross domestic product ( GDP ) was $ 101 billion with a GDP per capita of $ 45,465 . New Mexico 's status as a tax haven yields low to moderate personal income taxes on residents and military personnel , and gives tax credits and exemptions to favorable industries . Because of this , its film industry has grown and contributed $ 1.23 billion to its overall economy . Due to its large area and economic climate , New Mexico has a large U.S. military presence marked notably with the White Sands Missile Range . Various U.S. national security agencies base their research and testing arms in New Mexico such as the Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories",

  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto )"
