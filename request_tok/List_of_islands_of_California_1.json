  "/wiki/Sacramento_River": "The Sacramento River ( Spanish : R\u00edo Sacramento ) is the principal river of Northern California in the United States , and is the largest river in California . Rising in the Klamath Mountains , the river flows south for 400 miles ( 640 km ) before reaching the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and San Francisco Bay . The river drains about 26,500 square miles ( 69,000 km2 ) in 19 California counties , mostly within the fertile agricultural region bounded by the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada known as the Sacramento Valley , but also extending as far as the volcanic plateaus of Northeastern California . Historically , its watershed has reached as far north as south-central Oregon where the now , primarily , endorheic ( closed ) Goose Lake rarely experiences southerly outflow into the Pit River , the most northerly tributary of the Sacramento . The Sacramento and its wide natural floodplain were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures , notably one of the southernmost large runs of chinook salmon in North America . For about 12,000 years , humans have depended on the vast natural resources of the watershed , which had one of the densest Native American populations in California . The river has provided a route for trade and travel since ancient times . Hundreds of tribes sharing regional customs and traditions inhabited the Sacramento Valley , first coming into contact with European explorers in the late 1700s . The Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga named the river Rio de los Sacramentos in 1808 , later shortened and anglicized into Sacramento . In the 19th century , gold was discovered on a tributary of the Sacramento River , starting the California Gold Rush and an enormous population influx to the state . Overland trails such as the California Trail and Siskiyou Trail guided hundreds of thousands of people to the gold fields . By the late part of the century mining had ceased to be a major part of the economy , and many immigrants turned to farming and ranching .",

The 366-mile ( 589 km ) long river starts in the high Sierra Nevada , and flows through the rich agricultural region of the northern San Joaquin Valley before reaching Suisun Bay , San Francisco Bay , and the Pacific Ocean . An important source of irrigation water as well as a wildlife corridor , the San Joaquin is among the most heavily dammed and diverted of California 's rivers . People have inhabited the San Joaquin Valley for more than 8,000 years , and it was long one of the major population centers of pre-Columbian California . Starting in the late 18th century , successive waves of explorers then settlers , mainly Spanish and American , emigrated to the San Joaquin basin , first exploiting then driving out the indigenous tribes . The newcomers quickly appropriated the rich natural and hydrologic resources of the watershed for use in farms and cities , but found themselves plagued by flood and drought . Because of the uniform topography of the San Joaquin Valley , floods once transformed much of the lower river into a huge inland sea . In the 20th century , many levees and dams were built on the San Joaquin and all of its major tributaries . These engineering works changed the fluctuating nature of the river forever , and cut off the Tulare Basin from the rest of the San Joaquin watershed . Once habitat for hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds , today the river is subject to tremendous water-supply , navigation and regulation works by various federal agencies , which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Old_River_(California)": "The Old River is a tidal distributary of the San Joaquin River that flows for about 40 miles ( 64 km ) through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in Northern California . The Old River was once the main channel of the San Joaquin until navigation ( Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel ) and flood control projects in the late 19th and 20th century fixed the San Joaquin to its present course past Stockton . It diverges from the San Joaquin near Tracy , about 38 miles ( 61 km ) upstream from Antioch , and first runs west towards Mountain House , then north to rejoin the San Joaquin 13 miles ( 21 km ) above Antioch . The river is lined with levees that prevent flooding of the adjacent Delta islands , many of which lie below sea level . The Middle River runs east of and roughly parallel to Old River . False River diverges from Old River about a mile ( 1.6 km ) above the Old River 's mouth and runs westward to join the San Joaquin at a point closer to Antioch . Part of the Old River forms the boundary between San Joaquin County on the east and Contra Costa County to the west . About halfway along its course the Old River passes by the Clifton Court Forebay , where water is pumped from the Delta to support California 's two primary water supply systems , the Central Valley Project and State Water Project . Because both projects derive their sources from the Sacramento River further north , pumping results in a reverse flow in the Old River as water flowing through the Delta Cross Channel is drawn southward through the Delta and up the Old River . ( Naturally , the Old River would have flowed in a northerly direction ) . During dry summers , this often results in saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay . The reverse flow also confuses migrating salmon in the San Joaquin River which may have contributed to the decline of the species in the 20th century .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states .

Sherman Island is a widely known windsurfing area . Sherman Island is 10 feet below sea level , due to the drainage of wetlands in the Delta which has dried out its peat soils , resulting in land subsidence . In . parts of Sherman Island , the land has now subsided 25 feet since the late 1800s - and continues to sink between half an inch and 1.5 inches yearly . It is possible that simultaneous levee failures on Sherman Island and surrounding islands , occurring in the wake of an earthquake , could threaten the fresh water supply for the Central Valley .",

  "/wiki/Twitchell_Island": "Twitchell Island is an island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in Sacramento County , California , 35 kilometres ( 22 miles ) southwest of Sacramento . At 2 metres ( 6.6 feet ) below sea level , the 1,200 ha ( 3,000-acre ) is bounded on the north by Seven Mile Slough , on the east and south by the San Joaquin River , and on the west by Three Mile Slough . The island is entirely within the Rio Vista Gas Field , although well pads and associated infrastructure make up only a small part of its land use . Twitchell is eighty-five percent owned by the State of California . Twitchell Island is the site of an experiment being conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey to study whether growing tules and cattails on the sinking islands of the Sacramento Delta can reverse the soil loss caused by wind , rain and farming . The soil under the 15-acre ( 6.1-hectare ) site has risen 1 to 2 feet ( 0.30-0.61 metres ) since the project started in 1996 . The plants not only help rebuild the level of the soil , but sequester quite a bit of carbon as well . It is believed that farmers in the delta might be able to make money with so-called carbon-capture farming by planting tules and cattails rather than row crops and get paid by companies who need to meet state greenhouse gas limits .",
