  "/wiki/British_Rail": "British Railways ( BR ) , which from 1965 traded as British Rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997 . It was formed from the nationalisation of the Big Four British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board . The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . A process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ) . Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . On privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . The British Rail double arrow logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision . It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the Rail Delivery Group 's ( RDG ) jointly-managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .",

  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_37": "The British Rail Class 37 is a diesel-electric locomotive . Also known as the English Electric Type 3 , the Class was ordered as part of the British Rail modernisation plan . They were numbered in two series , D6600-D6608 and D6700-D6999 . The Class 37 became a familiar sight on many parts of the British Rail network , in particular forming the main motive power for InterCity services in East Anglia and within Scotland . They also performed well on secondary and inter-regional services for many years . The Class 37s are known to some railway enthusiasts as Tractors , a nickname due to the agricultural sound of the diesel engine of the locomotive . Despite all members of the class now being at least 54 years old , over 60 locomotives are still mainline registered and remain active undertaking a variety of passenger , freight and departmental duties on the national rail network in 2019 . Approximately 30 locomotives have been preserved .",
