  "/wiki/States_of_Germany": "The Federal Republic of Germany ( informally often simply referred to as Germany ) is a federal republic consisting of sixteen partly-sovereign states ( German : Land ( Country ) , plural L\u00e4nder ( Countries ) commonly informally Bundesland ( Federal Country ) and Bundesl\u00e4nder ( Federal Countries ) ) . [ a ] Since the German nation state was formed from an earlier collection of several states , it has a federal constitution , and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty . With an emphasis on geographical conditions , Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called Stadtstaaten ( City-states ) , as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen , which in fact includes the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven . The remaining 13 states are called Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder ( literally roughly : Area states ) . The creation of the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) in 1949 was through the unification of the western states ( which were previously under American , British , and French administration ) created in the aftermath of World War II . Initially , in 1949 , the states of the Federal Republic were Baden ( until 1952 ) , Bavaria ( in German : Bayern ) , Bremen , Hamburg , Hesse ( Hessen ) , Lower Saxony ( Niedersachsen ) , North Rhine-Westphalia ( Nordrhein-Westfalen ) , Rhineland-Palatinate ( Rheinland-Pfalz ) , Schleswig-Holstein , W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden ( until 1952 ) , and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern ( until 1952 ) . West Berlin , while officially not part of the Federal Republic , was largely integrated and considered as a de facto state . In 1952 , following a referendum , Baden , W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden , and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged into Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg . In 1957 , the Saar Protectorate rejoined the Federal Republic as the Saarland . German reunification in 1990 , in which the area of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) became part of the Federal Republic , was performed by the way of accession of the re-established eastern states of Brandenburg , Mecklenburg-West Pomerania ( Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ) , Saxony ( Sachsen ) , Saxony-Anhalt ( Sachsen-Anhalt ) , and Thuringia ( Th\u00fcringen ) to the Federal Republic , as well as the de facto reunification of West and East Berlin into Berlin and its establishment as a full and equal state . A regional referendum in 1996 to merge Berlin with surrounding Brandenburg as Berlin-Brandenburg failed to reach the necessary majority vote in Brandenburg , while a majority of Berliners voted in favour of the merger . Federalism is one of the entrenched constitutional principles of Germany .",
