It is located near the village of Sittee River in the Stann Creek district . The cultivation of sugar cane was introduced to Belize , before becoming a British colony , in 1848 by the Maya and Mestizo refugees fleeing from the Caste War in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula . After the American Civil War in 1865 , American immigrants from the southern United States invested heavily in sugar plantations and small sugar mills throughout southern Belize . Serpon Estate was bought by a Scottish man named William Bowman . In 1863 , Bowman and the owners of another estate , Regalia , began construction on two steam-powered mills , marking the arrival of the industrial era in Belize . Parts of the sugar mill at Serpon were manufactured by Stewart and Company in Glasgow , and its crusher , boiler , beam engine and furnace were all powered by steam . During its peak , it is estimated that the Serpon sugar mill was producing and shipping over 770 kilograms of sugar a month . This and the output from the Regalia mill is said to have fuelled Belize 's economy for about 30 years . By the start of the 20th century , however , sugar production was found to be more profitable in the Corozal and Orange Walk districts , which led to the abandonment of the Serpon and Regalia mills in 1910 . In 2009 , the ruins of the Serpon Sugar Mill were designated an archaeological reserve",
