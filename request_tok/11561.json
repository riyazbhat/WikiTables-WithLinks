  "/wiki/Dom_Juan": "Dom Juan or The Feast with the Statue ( French : Dom Juan ou le Festin de pierre [ d\u0254\u0303 \u0292\u0265\u0251\u0303 u l\u0259 f\u025bst\u025b\u0303 d\u0259 pj\u025b\u0281 ] or simply Le Festin de pierre ) is a French play , a comedy in five acts , written by Moli\u00e8re , and based on the legend of Don Juan . The title of Moli\u00e8re 's play is also commonly expressed as Don Juan , a spelling that began in the seventeenth century . Moli\u00e8re 's characters Dom Juan and Sganarelle are the French counterparts to the Spanish Don Juan and Catalin\u00f3n , characters who are also found in Mozart 's Italian opera Don Giovanni as Don Giovanni and Leporello . Dom Juan is the last part in Moli\u00e8re 's hypocrisy trilogy , which also includes The School for Wives and Tartuffe . It was first performed on 15 February 1665 in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal , with Moli\u00e8re playing the role of Sganarelle . The play was originally written in prose , and was withdrawn after only 15 performances after attacks by Moli\u00e8re 's critics , who believed that he was offending religion and the king by eulogizing a libertine . The play was a costly failure . Sganarelle , Dom Juan 's valet , is the only character who speaks up for religion , but his particular brand of superstitious Catholicism is used more as a comic device than as a foil to his master 's free-thinking . As a result , Moli\u00e8re was ordered to delete a certain number of scenes and lines which , according to his censors , made a mockery of their faith . The play was published in a heavily censored version for the first time in 1682 . It was part of an eight-volume edition , edited by La Grange and Vivot , that contained almost all of Moli\u00e8re 's plays . The parts of Dom Juan that offended the censors were pasted over with strips of paper glued into almost all of the copies .",

  "/wiki/The_Ordeal_of_Gilbert_Pinfold": "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is a novel by the British writer Evelyn Waugh , first published in July 1957 . It is Waugh 's penultimate full-length work of fiction , which the author called his mad book - a largely autobiographical account of a period of hallucinations caused by bromide intoxication that he experienced in the early months of 1954 , recounted through his protagonist Gilbert Pinfold . Waugh 's health in the winter of 1953-54 was indifferent , and he was beset with various personal anxieties that were stifling his ability to work . He was also consuming alcohol , bromide and chloral in large amounts . In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing , he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon , but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage . These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold , a successful writer in the Waugh mould who , as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia , is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs . This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold for the sake of his health ; he hears voices that insult , taunt and threaten him . He leaves the ship , but his unseen tormentors follow him . On his return to England , his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary , and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture . Pinfold , however , also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil . On the book 's publication , Waugh 's friends praised it , but its general critical reception was muted . Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh with which the novel opens , but expressed divided views about the rest , in particular the ending .",

  "/wiki/Present_Laughter": "Present Laughter is a comic play written by No\u00ebl Coward in 1939 but not produced until 1942 because the Second World War began while it was in rehearsal , and the British theatres closed . The title is drawn from a song in Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night that urges carpe diem ( present mirth hath present laughter ) . The play has been frequently revived in Britain , the US and beyond . The plot depicts a few days in the life of the successful and self-obsessed light comedy actor Garry Essendine as he prepares to travel for a touring commitment in Africa . Amid a series of events bordering on farce , Garry has to deal with women who want to seduce him , placate both his long-suffering secretary and his wife , cope with a crazed young playwright , and overcome his impending mid-life crisis ( since he has recently turned forty ) . The character is a caricature of the author 's real-life persona , as Coward acknowledged . Coward starred as Garry during the original run , which began with a long provincial tour to accommodate wartime audiences . He reprised the role in the first British revival and later in the US and Paris . Subsequent productions have featured actors such as Albert Finney , Peter O'Toole , Donald Sinden , Ian McKellen and Simon Callow , and in the US Clifton Webb , Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , George C.

  "/wiki/The_Provoked_Wife": "The Provoked Wife ( 1697 ) is the second original comedy written by John Vanbrugh . It made its first appearance in Lincoln 's Inn Fields in May , 1697 . The often-repeated claim that Vanbrugh wrote part of his comedy The Provoked Wife in the Bastille is based on allusions in a couple of much later memoirs , but is regarded with some doubt by modern scholars ( see McCormick ) . It is different in tone from his first play , the largely farcical The Relapse , and adapted to the greater acting skills of the new company of actors chosen for its premiere , who walked out not long before in a dispute with management . The actors ' cooperative boasted the established star performers of the age , and Vanbrugh tailored The Provoked Wife to their specialties . While The Relapse had been robustly phrased to be suitable for amateurs and minor acting talents , he could count on versatile professionals like Thomas Betterton , Elizabeth Barry , and the rising young star Anne Bracegirdle to do justice to characters of depth and nuance .",

It was described by Frederick S. Boas as one of Shakespeare 's problem plays . The play ends on a very bleak note with the death of the noble Trojan Hector and destruction of the love between Troilus and Cressida . The work has in recent years stimulated exceptionally lively critical debate . Throughout the play , the tone lurches wildly between bawdy comedy and tragic gloom , and readers and theatre-goers have frequently found it difficult to understand how one is meant to respond to the characters . Several characteristic elements of the play ( the most notable being its constant questioning of intrinsic values such as hierarchy , honour and love ) have often been viewed as distinctly modern , as in the following remarks on the play by author and literary scholar Joyce Carol Oates :",

She was married to King Menelaus of Sparta but was abducted by Prince Paris of Troy after the goddess Aphrodite promised her to him in the Judgement of Paris . This resulted in the Trojan War when the Achaeans set out to reclaim her . She was believed to have been the daughter of Zeus and Leda , and was the sister of Clytemnestra , Castor and Polydeuces , Philonoe , Phoebe and Timandra . Elements of her putative biography come from classical authors such as Aristophanes , Cicero , Euripides , and Homer ( in both the Iliad and the Odyssey ) . Her story reappears in Book II of Virgil 's Aeneid . In her youth , she was abducted by Theseus . A competition between her suitors for her hand in marriage saw Menelaus emerge victorious . An oath sworn by all the suitors ( known as the Oath of Tyndareus ) required all of them to provide military assistance to the winning suitor , whomever he might be , if she were ever stolen from him ; the obligations of the oath precipitated the Trojan War . When she married Menelaus she was still very young ; whether her subsequent departure with Paris was an abduction or an elopement is ambiguous ( probably deliberately so ) . The legends of Helen in Troy are contradictory : Homer depicts her as a wistful , even sorrowful figure , who came to regret her choice and wished to be reunited with Menelaus . Other accounts have a treacherous Helen who simulated Bacchic rites and rejoiced in the carnage she caused .",
