His original given name was Morinobu ; he was the eldest son of Kan\u014d Takanobu and grandson of Kan\u014d Eitoku . Many of the most famous and widely known Kan\u014d works today are by Tan'y\u016b . In 1617 , Tan'y\u016b was appointed by the Tokugawa shogunate to become the shogunate 's first official painter . Over the following years , he was given many highly prestigious commissions . Over the 1620s and 1630s , he created a number of large-scale works for Edo Castle , Nij\u014d Castle , Osaka Castle , Nagoya Castle , and Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b . Prolific in a variety of painting styles , Tan'y\u016b 's most famous works are probably those he produced for these large-scale commissions . They are screens and panels , prime examples of the Momoyama style , depicting natural subjects such as tigers , birds and plants , in bright colors and with extensive use of gold leaf . The gold , often used to represent clouds , water , or other background elements , would reflect what little light was available indoors , brightening a castle 's dark rooms . Tan'y\u016b was also accomplished , however , in monochrome ink painting based on the prototypical style of the Muromachi period , yamato-e compositions in a style similar to that of the Tosa school , and Chinese style scrolls . His most famous yamato-e work is a narrative handscroll depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu , the first Tokugawa sh\u014dgun and major figure in Japanese history . It was after this commission , in 1640 , that the artist first took on the artist name of Tan'y\u016b .",

  "/wiki/Arhat_(Buddhism)": "In Buddhism , an arhat ( Sanskrit ) or arahant ( Pali ) is one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved nirvana . Mahayana Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the path of Enlightenment , but who may not have reached full Buddhahood . The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries , and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions . A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the early Buddhist schools . The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da , K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya , Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika , Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika , Lokottarav\u0101da , Bahu\u015brut\u012bya , Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da , and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to buddhas . Mahayana Buddhist teachings urge followers to take up the path of a bodhisattva , and to not fall back to the level of arhats and \u015br\u0101vakas . The arhats , or at least the senior arhats , came to be widely regarded by Theravada buddhists as moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way . Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of Eighteen Arhats ( with names and personalities ) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as Maitreya , while other groupings of 6 , 8 , 16 , 100 , and 500 also appear in tradition and Buddhist art , especially in East Asia called luohan or lohan .

They are similar to other forms of prayer beads used in various world religions and therefore the term Buddhist rosary also appears . Conventional Buddhist tradition counts the beads at 108 , signifying the mortal desires of mankind . The number is attributed to the Mokugenji ( soapberry seed ) Sutra wherein Shakyamuni Buddha instructed King Virudhaka to make such beads and recite the Three Jewels of Buddhism . In later years , various Buddhist sects would either retain the number of beads , or divide them into consecutive twos , fours , for brevity or informality . A decorative tassel is sometimes attached to the beads , flanked by talismans or amulets depending on one 's local tradition . Because prayer beads are often painted in pigment , various traditional schools attribute a consecration ritual by the Sangha to the beads , to open the eyes for the purpose of achieving Enlightenment unique to the Karma of each believer . Malas are used for keeping count while reciting , chanting , or mentally repeating a mantra or the name or names of a deity . This s\u0101dhan\u0101 ( practice ) is known in Sanskrit as japa .
