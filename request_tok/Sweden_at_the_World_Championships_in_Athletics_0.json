Nemetz grew up in Eskilstuna and began competing in athletics and skiing . She eventually settled on running as her focus and made her breakthrough at national level in 1978 by winning the 1500 metres and 3000 metres titles at the Swedish Athletics Championships . She followed this up by retaining those titles the following season and also taking the cross country running short race title . Nemetz won her first major medal at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics . This was a two-event competition created by the International Amateur Athletics Federation in response to the lack of the women 's 400 metres hurdles and 3000 m run at the 1980 Summer Olympics . Nemetz took the 3000 m silver medal behind Birgit Friedmann . Her runner-up time of 8:50.22 minutes was a new Swedish record and she was the first to beat Inger Knutsson 's Swedish time for that distance . Nemetz 's time stood for almost sixteen years , at which point Sara Wedlund improved the mark by a second and a half . Nemetz also retained her Swedish short cross country title , but Katharina J\u00f6nn\u00e5 and Birgit Bringslid took that year 's Swedish track titles .
