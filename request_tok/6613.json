  "/wiki/Francia": "Francia , also called the Kingdom of the Franks ( Latin : Regnum Francorum ) , or Frankish Empire , was the largest post-Roman barbarian kingdom in Western Europe . It was ruled by the Franks during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages . It is the predecessor of the modern states of France and Germany . After the Treaty of Verdun in 843 , West Francia became the predecessor of France , and East Francia became that of Germany . Francia was among the last surviving Germanic kingdoms from the Migration Period era before its partition in 843 . The core Frankish territories inside the former Western Roman Empire were close to the Rhine and Maas rivers in the north . After a period where small kingdoms inter-acted with the remaining Gallo-Roman institutions to their south , a single kingdom uniting them was founded by Clovis I who was crowned King of the Franks in 496 . His dynasty , the Merovingian dynasty , was eventually replaced by the Carolingian dynasty . Under the nearly continuous campaigns of Pepin of Herstal , Charles Martel , Pepin the Short , Charlemagne , and Louis the Pious - father , son , grandson , great-grandson and great-great-grandson - the greatest expansion of the Frankish empire was secured by the early 9th century , by this point dubbed as the Carolingian Empire . During the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties the Frankish realm was one large kingdom polity subdivided into several smaller kingdoms , often effectively independent . The geography and number of subkingdoms varied over time , but a basic split between eastern and western domains persisted .

He is considered to have been the founder of the Merovingian dynasty , which ruled the Frankish kingdom for the next two centuries . Clovis succeeding his father , Childeric I , as a king of Salian Franks within the Roman empire in 481 , and eventually came to rule an area extending from what is now the southern Netherlands to northern France , corresponding in Roman terms to Gallia Belgica ( northern Gaul ) . At the Battle of Soissons ( 486 ) he took full control of a rump state of the Western Roman Empire there which had been controlled by Syagrius . By the time of his death in either 511 or 513 , he had also conquered smaller Frankish kingdoms towards the northeast , the Alemanni to the east , and Visigothic kingdom of Aquitania to the south . Clovis is important in the historiography of France as the first king of what would become France . Clovis is also significant due to his conversion to Catholicism in 496 , largely at the behest of his wife , Clotilde , who would later be venerated as a saint for this act , celebrated today in both the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church . Clovis was baptized on Christmas Day in 508 . The adoption by Clovis of Catholicism ( as opposed to the Arianism of most other Germanic tribes ) led to widespread conversion among the Frankish peoples , to religious unification across what is now modern-day France , Belgium and Germany , and three centuries later to Charlemagne 's alliance with the Bishop of Rome and in the middle of the 10th century under Otto I the Great to the consequent birth of the early Holy Roman Empire .",

In 800 , the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west . The Carolingian Empire is considered the first phase in the history of the Holy Roman Empire , which lasted until 1806 . After a civil war ( 840-843 ) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious , the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms , with one king still recognised as emperor , but with little authority outside his own kingdom . The unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the Carolingians continued to be acknowledged . In 884 , Charles the Fat reunited all the Carolingian kingdoms for the last time , but he died in 888 and the empire immediately split up . With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child , the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or , in the case of the eastern kingdom , an illegitimate Carolingian . The illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911 , while in the western kingdom the legitimate Carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936 .

Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon , born before their canonical marriage . He became king in 768 following his father 's death , initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman 's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom . He continued his father 's policy towards the papacy and became its protector , removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain . He campaigned against the Saxons to his east , Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden . He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Charlemagne has been called the Father of Europe ( Pater Europae ) , as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule . His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance , a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church .",

  "/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Baden": "The Grand Duchy of Baden ( German : Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden ) was a state in the southwest German Empire on the east bank of the Rhine . It existed between 1806 and 1918 . It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines , which were unified in 1771 . It then became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803-1806 and was a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871 , remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden . Baden was bordered to the north by the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt ; to the west , along most of its length , by the river Rhine , which separated Baden from the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate and Alsace in modern France ; to the south by Switzerland ; and to the east by the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Bavaria . After World War II , the French military government in 1945 created the state of Baden ( originally known as South Baden ) out of the southern half of the former Baden , with Freiburg as its capital . This portion of the former Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden . The northern half of the old Baden was combined with northern W\u00fcrttemberg , becoming part of the American military zone , and formed the state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden . Both Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden became states of West Germany upon its formation in 1949 . In 1952 Baden merged with W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern ( southern W\u00fcrttemberg and the former Prussian exclave of Hohenzollern ) to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg .

It was formed initially from sixteen German states by Napoleon after he defeated Austria and Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz . The Treaty of Pressburg , in effect , led to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine , which lasted from 1806 to 1813 . The members of the confederation were German princes ( F\u00fcrsten ) formerly within the Holy Roman Empire . They were later joined by 19 others , altogether ruling a total of over 15 million subjects providing a significant strategic advantage to the French Empire on its eastern frontier by providing a separation between France and the two largest German states , Prussia and Austria ( which also controlled substantial non-German lands to its north , east and south ) , to the east , which were not members of the Confederation of the Rhine .",

The German Confederation excluded German-speaking lands in the eastern portion of the Kingdom of Prussia ( East Prussia , West Prussia and Posen ) , the German cantons of Switzerland , and the French region of Alsace , which was predominantly German speaking . The Confederation was weakened by rivalry between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire , the German revolutions of 1848-49 , and the inability of its multiple members to compromise . In 1848 , revolutions by liberals and nationalists attempted to establish a unified German state with a progressive liberal constitution under the Frankfurt Convention . The ruling body , the Confederate Diet , was dissolved on 12 July 1848 , but was re-established in 1850 after failed efforts to replace it . The Confederation was finally dissolved after the victory of the Kingdom of Prussia in the Seven Weeks ' War over Austrian Empire in 1866 . The dispute over which had the inherent right to rule German lands ended in favour of Prussia , leading to the creation of the North German Confederation under Prussian leadership in 1867 , to which the eastern portions of the Kingdom of Prussia were added . A number of South German states remained independent until they joined the North German Confederation , which was renamed and proclaimed as the German Empire in 1871 for the now unified Germany ( aside from Austria ) with the Prussian king as emperor ( Kaiser ) after the victory over French Emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 . Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective , as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state .

The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",

The four powers divided 'Germany as a whole ' into four occupation zones for administrative purposes , under the United States , United Kingdom , France and the Soviet Union respectively ; creating what became collectively known as Allied-occupied Germany ( German : Alliierten-besetztes Deutschland ) . This division was ratified at the Potsdam Conference ( 17 July to 2 August 1945 ) . [ not verified in body ] The four zones were as agreed in February 1945 by the United States , United Kingdom and Soviet Union meeting at the Yalta Conference ; setting aside an earlier division into three zones ( excluding France ) proposed by the London Protocol . At Potsdam , the United States , United Kingdom and the Soviet Union approved the detachment from 'Germany as a whole ' of the German eastern territories east of the Oder-Neisse line ; with the exact line of the boundary to be determined at a final German Peace Treaty . This treaty was expected to confirm the shifting westward of Poland 's borders , as the United Kingdom and the United States committed themselves to support in any future peace treaty the permanent incorporation of former eastern German territories into Poland and the Soviet Union . From March 1945 to July 1945 , these former eastern territories of Germany had been administered under Soviet military occupation authorities , but following the Potsdam Conference they were handed over to Soviet and Polish civilian administrations and ceased to constitute part of Allied-occupied Germany . In the closing weeks of fighting in Europe , United States forces had pushed beyond the agreed boundaries for the future zones of occupation , in some places by as much as 320 km ( 200 miles ) . The so-called line of contact between Soviet and American forces at the end of hostilities , mostly lying eastward of the July 1945-established inner German border , was temporary . After two months in which they had held areas that had been assigned to the Soviet zone , U.S. forces withdrew in the first days of July 1945 . Some have concluded that this was a crucial move that persuaded the Soviet Union to allow American , British and French forces into their designated sectors in Berlin , which occurred at roughly the same time ( July 1945 ) , although the need for intelligence gathering ( see Operation Paperclip ) may also have been a factor .",

The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate .

The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity ( German : Deutsche Einheit ) , celebrated each year on 3 October as German Unity Day ( German : Tag der deutschen Einheit ) . Berlin was reunited into a single city , and was once again designated as the capital of united Germany . The East German government started to falter in May 1989 , when the removal of Hungary 's border fence with Austria opened a hole in the Iron Curtain . It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary . The Peaceful Revolution , a series of protests by East Germans , led to the GDR 's first free elections on 18 March 1990 , and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty . Other negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called Two Plus Four Treaty ( Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany ) granting full sovereignty to a unified German state , whose two parts were previously bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupied regions . The 1945 Potsdam Agreement had specified that a full peace treaty concluding World War II , including the exact delimitation of Germany 's postwar boundaries , required to be accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established . The Federal Republic had always maintained that no such government could be said to have been established until East and West Germany had been united within a free democratic state ; but in 1990 a range of opinions continued to be maintained over whether a unified West Germany , East Germany , and Berlin could be said to represent Germany as a whole for this purpose . The key question was whether a Germany that remained bounded to the east by the Oder-Neisse line could act as a united Germany in signing the peace treaty without qualification . Under the Two Plus Four Treaty both the Federal Republic and the Democratic Republic committed themselves and their unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany , and hence that there were no further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole .

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",
  "/wiki/West_Berlin": "West Berlin ( German : Berlin ( West ) or colloquially West-Berlin ) was a political enclave which comprised the western part of Berlin during the years of the Cold War . There was no specific date on which the sectors of Berlin occupied by the Western Allies became West Berlin , but 1949 is widely accepted as the year in which the name was adopted . West Berlin aligned itself politically with the Federal Republic of Germany ( called the Bonn Republic by historians ) and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions . West Berlin was formally controlled by the Western Allies and was entirely surrounded by the Soviet-controlled East Berlin and East Germany . West Berlin had great symbolic significance during the Cold War , as it was widely considered by westerners as an island of freedom . It was heavily subsidised by West Germany as a showcase of the West . A wealthy city , West Berlin was noted for its distinctly cosmopolitan character , and as a centre of education , research and culture . With about two million inhabitants , West Berlin had the largest population of any city in Germany during the Cold War era . West Berlin was 100 miles ( 161 kilometres ) east and north of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors . It consisted of the American , British , and French occupation sectors established in 1945 . The Berlin Wall , built in 1961 , physically separated West Berlin from its East Berlin and East German surroundings until it fell in 1989 . On 3 October 1990 , the day Germany was officially reunified , East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin .",

Its 535,061 ( 2017 ) inhabitants make it the thirteenth-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen . The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine ( progression : Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea ) and its tributary Ihme , in the south of the North German Plain , and is the largest city in the Hannover-Braunschweig-G\u00f6ttingen-Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region . It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg , Dortmund , Essen and Bremen . Before it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946 Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg ( 1636-1692 ) , the Electorate of Hanover ( 1692-1814 ) , the Kingdom of Hanover ( 1814-1866 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1868-1918 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia ( 1918-1946 ) and of the State of Hanover ( 1946 ) . From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( later described as the Elector of Hanover ) . The city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways ( Autobahnen ) , connecting European main lines in both the east-west ( Berlin-Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne ) and north-south ( Hamburg-Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich ) directions . Hannover Airport lies north of the city , in Langenhagen , and is Germany 's ninth-busiest airport .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover": "The Kingdom of Hanover ( German : K\u00f6nigreich Hannover ) was established in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna , with the restoration of George III to his Hanoverian territories after the Napoleonic era . It succeeded the former Electorate of Hanover ( known formally as the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ) , and joined 38 other sovereign states in the German Confederation in June 1815 . The kingdom was ruled by the House of Hanover , a cadet branch of the House of Welf , in personal union with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland since 1714 . Since its monarch resided in London , a viceroy ( usually a younger member of the British Royal Family ) handled the administration of the Kingdom of Hanover . The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 upon the accession of Queen Victoria because females could not inherit the Hanoverian throne , so her uncle became the ruler of Hanover . Hanover backed the losing side in the Austro-Prussian War and was conquered by Prussia in 1866 , subsequently becoming a Prussian province . Along with the rest of Prussia , Hanover became part of the German Empire upon unification in January 1871 . Briefly revived as the State of Hanover in 1946 , the state was subsequently merged with some smaller states to form the current state of Lower Saxony in West Germany , later Germany .",

It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947 . For centuries , the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then , in 1701 , in Berlin , decisively shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , most German states ( notably excluding Austria and Switzerland ) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic - the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , in 1945 , the division of Germany into Allied occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the Oder-Neisse line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto . Prussia existed de jure until its formal abolition by the Allied Control Council Enactment No . 46 of 25 February 1947 . The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians ; in the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights - an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders - conquered the lands inhabited by them .",

After Hanover voted in favour of mobilising confederation troops against Prussia on 14 June 1866 , Prussia saw this as a just cause for declaring war ; the Kingdom of Hanover was soon dissolved and annexed by Prussia . The private wealth of the dethroned House of Hanover was then used by Otto von Bismarck to finance his continuing efforts against Ludwig II of Bavaria . In 1946 , the British military administration recreated the State of Hanover based on the former Kingdom of Hanover ; but within the year , at the instigation of the German leadership , it was merged into the new state ( Bundesland ) of Lower Saxony - along with the states of Oldenburg , Brunswick , and Schaumburg-Lippe - with the city of Hanover as the capital of this new state .",
