Designed by Spanish/Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed ( 1852-1926 ) , his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . On 7 November 2010 , Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica . On 19 March 1882 , construction of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar . In 1883 , when Villar resigned , Gaud\u00ed took over as chief architect , transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style , combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms . Gaud\u00ed devoted the remainder of his life to the project , and he is buried in the crypt . At the time of his death in 1926 , less than a quarter of the project was complete . Relying solely on private donations , the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia 's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War . In July 1936 , revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop , partially destroying Gaud\u00ed 's original plans , drawings and plaster models , which led to 16 years work to piece together the fragments of the master model . Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s . Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control ( CNC ) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010 . However , some of the project 's greatest challenges remain , including the construction of ten more spires , each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament",

Gaud\u00ed 's works have a highly individualized , one-of-a-kind style . Most are located in Barcelona , including his main work , the church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia . Gaud\u00ed 's work was influenced by his passions in life : architecture , nature , and religion . He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics , stained glass , wrought ironwork forging and carpentry . He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials , such as trencad\u00eds which used waste ceramic pieces . Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques , Gaud\u00ed became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . His work transcended mainstream Modernisme , culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms . Gaud\u00ed rarely drew detailed plans of his works , instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them . Gaud\u00ed 's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects . His masterpiece , the still-incomplete Sagrada Fam\u00edlia , is the most-visited monument in Spain . Between 1984 and 2005 , seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO",

Carmel is in the municipal district of Horta-Guinard\u00f3 . The area was developed mainly in the 1960s and 1970s when immigrant workers , encouraged to move to Barcelona by the government of Francoist Spain , they built housing for themselves . The combination of houses , then isolated on the rural hillside of what is now Parc dels Tres Turons ( Three Hills Park ) , ad-hoc buildings put up without building permits and more planned urban development has given the area its modern appearance of many buildings piled on the hillside . Carmel became infamous in 2005 when there was a major tunnel construction accident . It brought to a halt the expansion works on line 5 of the Barcelona Metro and led to the evacuation of dozens of buildings in the area . Local residents protested and most of those evacuated to other areas have finally been rehoused and a new school opened .

He was also a Catalan politician . Born in Barcelona , he initially studied physics and natural sciences , but soon switched to architecture . He was registered as an architect in Barcelona in 1873 . He also held a 45-year tenure as a professor and director at the Escola d'Arquitectura , Barcelona 's school of architecture , and wrote extensively on architecture in essays , technical books and articles in newspapers and journals . His most famous buildings , the Hospital de Sant Pau and Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona , have been collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . As an architect , 45-year professor of architecture and prolific writer on architecture , Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner played an important role in defining the Modernisme arquitectonic in Catalonia . This style has become internationally renowned , mainly due to the work of Antoni Gaud\u00ed . Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner 's article En busca d'una arquitectura nacional ( In search of a national architecture ) , published 1878 in the journal La Renaixen\u00e7a , reflected the way architects at that time sought to build structures that reflected the Catalan character . His buildings displayed a mixture between rationalism and fabulous ornamentation inspired by Spanish-Arabic architecture , and followed the curvilinear design typical of Art Nouveau . In the El castell dels 3 dragons restaurant in Barcelona ( built for the World 's Fair in 1888 ) , which was for many years the Zoological Museum , he applied very advanced solutions ( a visible iron structure and ceramics ) . He later developed this style further in other buildings , such as the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona ( 1908 ) , where he made extensive use of mosaic , ceramics and stained glass , the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona , and the Institut Pere Mata in Reus",

He was the architect of the Casa Mart\u00ed ( also known as Els Quatre Gats ) , which became a place of ideas , projects and social gatherings for such well-known Catalans as Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol and Ramon Casas . Although Puig 's style separated him significantly from his contemporary Gaud\u00ed , their relations were neither tense nor problematic , as demonstrated by the participation of both architects in the construction of the Cafe Torino . Another of his significant buildings was the Casa Terrades ( also known as les Punxes ) , which is known for its medieval castle style from the north of Europe . Puig was actively involved in politics . He was a Barcelona City Councillor from 1901 to 1903 , served in the Spanish Parliament from 1907 to 1910 and was the second president of the Commonwealth of Catalonia from 1917 to 1924 .

It is located at Carrer de Casp 48 , Eixample district of Barcelona . It was built between 1898 and 1900 . Gaud\u00ed scholars agree that this building is the most conventional of his works , partly because it had to be squeezed in between older structures and partly because it was sited in one of the most elegant sections of Barcelona . Its symmetry , balance and orderly rhythm are unusual for Gaud\u00ed 's works . However , the curves and double gable at the top , the projecting oriel at the entrance - almost baroque in its drama , and isolated witty details are modernista elements . Bulging balconies alternate with smaller , shallower balconies . Mushrooms above the oriel at the center allude to the owner 's favorite hobby . Columns flanking the entrance are in the form of stacked bobbins - an allusion to the family business of textile manufacture .

The style of Casa Vicens is a reflection of Neo-Mud\u00e9jar architecture , one of the popular styles that can be seen throughout Gaud\u00ed 's architecture , including oriental and neoclassical as well . However , what was unique about Gaud\u00ed was that he mixed different styles together and incorporated a variety of different materials , such as iron , glass , ceramic tiles and concrete , many of which can be seen in this building . Gaud\u00ed broke away from tradition and created his new language of architecture , and Casa Vicens represents a new chapter in the history of Catalan architecture as well as the beginning of a successful career for Gaud\u00ed . In 1883 , Gaud\u00ed received the commission from Manuel Vicens i Montaner for the completion of a summer residence . In February 1883 , Manuel Vicens requested permission from the City Council of Vila de Gr\u00e0cia to build a summer house on Calle Sant Gervasi 26 ( currently Carolines 20-26 ) . A month earlier he had requested permission to demolish the house he had inherited from his mother , Rosa Montaner given the poor state of conservation of the same .

It cuts the city in two , diagonally with respect to the grid pattern of the surrounding streets , hence the name . It was originally projected by engineer and urban planner Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 as one of the city 's wide avenues , which along with Avinguda Meridiana would cut the rationalist grid he designed for l'Eixample ( Catalan for extension ) . Both would meet at Pla\u00e7a de les Gl\u00f2ries Catalanes , which Cerd\u00e0 envisioned as the new city centre . However , Pla\u00e7a Catalunya , equally a new addition to the city of Barcelona , and connecting Ciutat Vella and Eixample , and therefore occupying a more privileged position in the urban area , would finally become the centre . Avinguda Diagonal remains to this day a much-transited avenue and many companies and hotels use it as a privileged location , as can be seen in its architecture . The avenue starts in the Les Corts district on the western edge of the city and runs to the Sant Mart\u00ed district on the eastern edge . To its west , it connects with the Lleida-Madrid highway and Ronda de Dalt in the neighbouring municipality of Esplugues de Llobregat .

  "/wiki/Greenhouse": "A greenhouse ( also called a glasshouse , or , if with sufficient heating , a hothouse ) is a structure with walls and roof made chiefly of transparent material , such as glass , in which plants requiring regulated climatic conditions are grown . These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized buildings . A miniature greenhouse is known as a cold frame . The interior of a greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes significantly warmer than the external temperature , protecting its contents in cold weather . Many commercial glass greenhouses or hothouses are high tech production facilities for vegetables , flowers or fruits . The glass greenhouses are filled with equipment including screening installations , heating , cooling , lighting , and may be controlled by a computer to optimize conditions for plant growth . Different techniques are then used to evaluate optimality-degrees and comfort ratio of greenhouseate ( i.e. , air temperature , relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit ) in order to reduce production risk prior to cultivation of a specific crop",
