  "/wiki/Richmond_Park_(football_ground)": "After the creation of the Irish Free State , and therefore the removal of the British Army , the ground lay idle for 3 years before League of Ireland club Brideville began using the ground in 1925 . In 1930 Brideville were forced to move to Harolds Cross Greyhound Stadium to accommodate St Patrick 's Athletic moving in . St. Pats continues to use and develop the ground until 1951 when they entered the League of Ireland . The league deemed the ground unsuitable and St. Pats were forced to use a variety of grounds in Dublin as they fought to upgrade Richmond Park . In 1960 , after serious development , the ground played host to St Pats first home league game in Inchicore . The ground closed for redevelopment in May 1989 , however due to St Pats hitting financially difficulties they did not return until 5 December 1993 . The ground lies behind a row of terraced housing in a natural valley and is often used for Republic of Ireland underage and women 's teams . It staged the League of Ireland Cup final in 1982 and 2003 . It has played host to a two Leinster Senior Cup finals , as well as many junior and intermediate finals . In 2001 , 2002 , 2003 and part of 2004 Shamrock Rovers played their home games in Richmond Park as tenants of St. Pats . In 2005 , Dublin City played the first 10 games of their season in the ground , under a similar arrangement . Richmond Park is usually used by non-league clubs in surrounding areas when they qualify for the FAI Cup ."
