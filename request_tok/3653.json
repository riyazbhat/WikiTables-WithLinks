  "/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)": "Metropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction drama film directed by Fritz Lang . Written by Thea von Harbou in collaboration with Lang , it stars Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich , Alfred Abel , Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Brigitte Helm . Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. ( UFA ) . The silent film is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction movie , being among the first feature-length movies of that genre . Filming took place over 17 months in 1925-26 at a cost of more than five million Reichsmarks . Made in Germany during the Weimar period , Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder , the wealthy son of the city master , and Maria , a saintly figure to the workers , to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes in their city and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen , the city master . The film 's message is encompassed in the final inter-title : The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart . Metropolis met a mixed reception upon release . Critics found it pictorially beautiful and visually powerful - the film 's art direction by Otto Hunte , Erich Kettelhut and Karl Vollbrecht draws influence from Bauhaus , Cubist and Futurist design , along with touches of the Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs , the cathedral and Rotwang 's house - and lauded its complex special effects , but accused its story of naivet\u00e9 . H. G. Wells described the film as silly , and The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction calls the film 's story trite and its politics ludicrously simplistic . The film 's alleged Communist message was also criticized . The film 's extensive running time also came in for criticism , and Metropolis was cut substantially after its German premiere , with a large portion of Lang 's original footage removed .",
