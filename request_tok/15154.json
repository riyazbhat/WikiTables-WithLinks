The tradition of holding the Winter Olympics in the same year as the Summer Olympics would continue until 1992 , after which the current practice of holding a Winter Olympics in the second year after each Summer Olympics began . Although Figure Skating had been an Olympic event in both London and Antwerp , and Ice Hockey had been an event in Antwerp , the winter sports had always been limited by the season . In 1921 , at the convention of the IOC in Lausanne , there was a call for equality for winter sports , and after much discussion it was decided to organize an international week of winter sport in 1924 in Chamonix .",

The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II ; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936 . From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany , the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games . The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war . These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . There were 28 nations that marched in the opening ceremonies on January 30 , 1948 .

Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935 ; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games , but World War II made that impossible . Instead , Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States . All of the venues were in Oslo 's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events , which were held at Norefjell , 113 km ( 70 mi ) from the capital . A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries , along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches , creating the first modern athlete 's village . The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated . The Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries , who participated in four sports and 22 events . Japan and Germany made their returns to winter Olympic competition , after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II . Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because East Germany declined to compete as a unified team . Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic debuts , and for the first time women were allowed to compete in cross-country skiing .

Tobogganing in the area started in the 1880s , with several roads being used during winter evenings . Auto racing took place in the hill in 1921 and the following year it saw its first luge tournament . The first major tournament was the FIL European Luge Championships 1937 . Tobagganing also took place in the nearby Heftyebakken , but from 1950 Korketrekkeren became the sole tobogganing hill and Heftyebakken was used for cross-country skiing . The bobsleigh track was built for the 1952 Winter Olympics , where it hosted two bobsleigh events . Contrary to popular belief , this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a separate run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren . It was built as a temporary , artificial track with the curves being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice .

Cortina , which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics , beat out Montreal , Colorado Springs and Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games . The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other . The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements , but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed . Consequently , the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding . Thirty-two nations - the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then - competed in the four sports and twenty-four events . Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics . The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games . Logistically , the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events . To remedy this , the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered . Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games - unlike the Summer Games in Melbourne , Australia later in the year which many nations boycotted after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution , and the Suez War .
