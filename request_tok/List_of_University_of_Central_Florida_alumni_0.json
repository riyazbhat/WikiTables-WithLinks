  "/wiki/NASA": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA , /\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0259/ ) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program , as well as aeronautics and aerospace research . [ note 1 ] NASA was established in 1958 , succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) . The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation , encouraging peaceful applications in space science . Since its establishment , most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA , including the Apollo Moon landing missions , the Skylab space station , and later the Space Shuttle . NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles . The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches . NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System ; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate 's Heliophysics Research Program ; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons ; and researching astrophysics topics , such as the Big Bang , through the Great Observatories and associated programs .",
  "/wiki/Astronaut": "An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command , pilot , or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft . Although generally reserved for professional space travelers , the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space , including scientists , politicians , journalists and tourists . Until 2002 , astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments , either by the military or by civilian space agencies . With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004 , a new category of astronaut was created : the commercial astronaut .",

  "/wiki/Free-fall": "In Newtonian physics , free fall is any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it . In the context of general relativity , where gravitation is reduced to a space-time curvature , a body in free fall has no force acting on it . An object in the technical sense of the term free fall may not necessarily be falling down in the usual sense of the term . An object moving upwards would not normally be considered to be falling , but if it is subject to the force of gravity only , it is said to be in free fall . The moon is thus in free fall . In a roughly uniform gravitational field , in the absence of any other forces , gravitation acts on each part of the body roughly equally , which results in the sensation of weightlessness , a condition that also occurs when the gravitational field is weak ( such as when far away from any source of gravity ) . The term free fall is often used more loosely than in the strict sense defined above . Thus , falling through an atmosphere without a deployed parachute , or lifting device , is also often referred to as free fall . The aerodynamic drag forces in such situations prevent them from producing full weightlessness , and thus a skydiver 's free fall after reaching terminal velocity produces the sensation of the body 's weight being supported on a cushion of air .",

  "/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Space_Center": "The John F. Kennedy Space Center ( KSC , originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center ) , located in Merritt Island , Florida , is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers . Since December 1968 , KSC has been NASA 's primary launch center of human spaceflight . Launch operations for the Apollo , Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC . Located on the east coast of Florida , KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) . The management of the two entities work very closely together , share resources , and even own facilities on each other 's property . Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS , the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization , the Launch Operations Directorate . Starting with the fourth Gemini mission , the NASA launch control center in Florida ( Mercury Control Center , later the Launch Control Center ) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston , shortly after liftoff ; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission . Additionally , the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off-Earth exploration . Since 2010 , the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships , even adding a new launch pad ( LC-39C ) in 2015 . There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped across the center 's 144,000 acres ( 580 km2 ) . Among the unique facilities at KSC are the 525-foot ( 160 m ) tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA 's largest rockets , the Launch Control Center , which conducts space launches at KSC , the Operations and Checkout Building , which houses the astronauts dormitories and suit-up area , a Space Station factory , and a 3-mile ( 4.8 km ) long Shuttle Landing Facility . There is also a Visitor Complex open to the public on site .",

  "/wiki/Space_shuttle_program": "The Space Shuttle program was the fourth human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , which accomplished routine transportation for Earth-to-orbit crew and cargo from 1981 to 2011 . Its official name , Space Transportation System ( STS ) , was taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development . The Space Shuttle - composed of an orbiter launched with two reusable solid rocket boosters and a disposable external fuel tank - carried up to eight astronauts and up to 50,000 lb ( 23,000 kg ) of payload into low Earth orbit ( LEO ) . When its mission was complete , the orbiter would re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere and land like a glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base . The Shuttle is the only winged crewed spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing , and the only reusable crewed space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit ( the Russian shuttle Buran was very similar and was designed to have the same capabilities but made only one uncrewed spaceflight before it was cancelled ) . Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits ( including segments to be added to the International Space Station ( ISS ) ) , providing crew rotation for the space station , and performing service missions on the Hubble Space Telescope . The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads ( e.g. , from the ISS ) from orbit and returned them to Earth , though its use in this capacity was rare . Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches , or 10 years ' operational life . Original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches over a 15-year operational span with a 'launch per month ' expected at the peak of the program , but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station never created such a peak demand for frequent flights .",
