This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender",

The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike .

It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30 % and 40 % share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers .

In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK .

It uses a third-person perspective , previously utilized by Sega 's earlier games Out Run and Space Harrier , and runs on the Sega X arcade system . Designed by Sega veteran Yu Suzuki and the Sega AM2 division , After Burner was intended as being Sega 's first true blockbuster video game . Development began shortly after the completion of Out Run , and was kept as a closely guarded secret within the company . Suzuki was inspired by the films Top Gun and Laputa : Castle in the Sky ; he originally planned for the game to have a steampunk aesthetic similar to Laputa , but instead went with a Top Gun look to make the game approachable for worldwide audiences . It was designed outside the company in a building named Studio 128 , due to Sega adopting a flextime schedule to allow for games to be worked outside company headquarters . After Burner was acclaimed by critics for its impressive visuals , gameplay and overall presentation , and is seen as being important and influential . It was followed by a series of sequels and ports for many platforms , including the Sega Master System , ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System .

Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 .

Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook .

  "/wiki/Ultra_Games": "Ultra Software Corporation was a shell corporation and publishing label created in 1988 as a subsidiary of Konami of America , in an effort to get around Nintendo of America 's strict licensing rules in place at the time for the North American market . One of these rules was that a third-party company could only publish up to five games per year for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US . This was hardly convenient for Konami , which had begun releasing more than ten games a year for both the Famicom and its Disk System add-on in Japan . With a greater library than it was allowed to localize , Konami formed the Ultra Games brand to extend its annual library to ten games a year . Ultra 's first game was the NES version of Metal Gear . At first , Ultra was dedicated to localizing Konami 's pre-existing software from Japan , but later it began publishing works from other companies as well . Some of Konami 's most notable games released under the Ultra label include Operation C , Snake 's Revenge and the first few Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games for the NES and Game Boy . Although created by Konami to bypass Nintendo policies , the Ultra label was also used on at least two IBM PC and Commodore 64 games : Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Metal Gear . After the North American launch of the Super NES in 1991 , Nintendo started relaxing the restriction on the number of games third parties could publish each year . As a result , Ultra Games began losing its purpose and Konami dropped the label in early 1992 . The last games released by Ultra Games were Ultra Golf and World Circuit Series , both released in March 1992 . In Europe , Konami established the Palcom Software Limited subsidiary for similar purposes",
