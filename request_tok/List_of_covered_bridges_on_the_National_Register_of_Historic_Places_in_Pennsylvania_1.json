  "/wiki/Covered_bridge": "A covered bridge is a timber-truss bridge with a roof , decking , and siding , which in most covered bridges create an almost complete enclosure . The purpose of the covering is to protect the wooden structural members from the weather . Uncovered wooden bridges typically have a lifespan of only 20 years because of the effects of rain and sun , but a covered bridge could last 100 years .",

A queen post is often confused with a queen strut , one of two compression members in roof framing which do not form a truss in the engineering sense .",

  "/wiki/Town_truss": "A lattice bridge is a form of truss bridge that uses many small , closely spaced diagonal elements forming a lattice . The lattice Truss Bridge was patented in 1820 by architect Ithiel Town . Originally a design to allow a substantial bridge to be made from planks employing lower-skilled labor , rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters , this type of bridge has also been constructed using many relatively light iron or steel members . The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers , but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction . A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust , as the bridge will tend to change length under load . This is resisted by pinning the lattice members to the top and bottom chords , which are more substantial than the lattice members , but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams .",

Contrary to popular belief , the word Dutch in Pennsylvania Dutch not a mistranslation , but rather a corruption of the Pennsylvania German endonym Deitsch , which means Pennsylvania Dutch / German or German . Ultimately , the terms Deitsch , Dutch , Diets and Deutsch are all cognates of the Proto-Germanic word *\u00feiudiskaz meaning popular or of the people . The continued use of Dutch instead of German was strengthend by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 19th century as a way of distinguising themselves from later ( post 1830 ) waves of German immigrants to the United States , with the Pennsylvania Dutch referring to themselves as Deitsche and to Germans as Deitschlenner ( literally Germany-ers , compare Deutschland-er ) whom they saw as a related but distinct group . The ancestors of the Amish began to immigrate to colonial Pennsylvania in the early 18th century to take advantage of the religious freedom offered by William Penn . They were also attracted by the area 's rich soil and mild climate . Also attracted to promises of religious freedom , French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution settled this area in 1710 .
