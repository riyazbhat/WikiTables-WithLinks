Alumnus Bunny Hadley donated the labor to wire the field , and poles were donated by a local lumber operator . Payment for the remainder of the work , including leasing a crane and operator , was through a $ 4,000 loan secured through Bank of America and paid off out of student fees over the next several years . The bowls turf was resurfaced during the summer of 2011 , and the track was resurfaced during the summer of 2017 . According to HSU Facilities Management , Redwood Bowl is the most heavily-used field on campus , employed by recreational sports programs , including intramurals , kinesiology and other department classes , football and track and field team practices and games , commencement , special events and general student use .",
