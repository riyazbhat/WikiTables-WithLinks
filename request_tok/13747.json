  "/wiki/Harold_Shipman": "Harold Frederick Shipman ( 14 January 1946 - 13 January 2004 ) was an English general practitioner and is believed to be the most prolific serial killer in history . On 31 January 2000 , a jury found Shipman guilty of the murder of 15 patients under his care , with his total number of victims estimated to be around 250 . He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released . The Shipman Inquiry , a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman , which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith , examined Shipman 's crimes . The inquiry identified 215 victims and estimated his total victim count at 250 , about 80 % of whom were elderly women . Shipman 's youngest confirmed victim was a 41-year-old man , although significant suspicion arose that he had killed patients as young as four . Much of the United Kingdom 's legal structure concerning health care and medicine was reviewed and modified as a result of Shipman 's crimes . He is the only British doctor to have been found guilty of murdering his patients , although other doctors have been acquitted of similar crimes or convicted on lesser charges . Shipman committed suicide on 13 January 2004 , one day prior to his 58th birthday , by hanging himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison .",

Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Kirkuk lies in a wide zone with an enormously diverse population and has been multilingual for centuries . There were dramatic demographic changes during Kirkuk 's urbanization in the twentieth century , which saw the development of distinct ethnic communities . Iraqi Turkmen , Kurds , Arabs , and Assyrian people lay conflicting claims to this zone , and all have their historical accounts and memories to buttress their claims . The city sits on the ruins of the original Kirkuk Citadel , site of the ancient mid-3rd millennium BC , Akkadian city of Arrapha , and which sits near the Khasa River . The region became a part of the Akkadian empire ( 2335-2154 BC ) which united all of the Akkadian and Sumerian speaking Mesopotamians under one rule . After its collapse , the language isolate-speaking Gutians , a pre-Iranic race from Ancient Iran , overran the region for a few decades , making Arrapha their capital , before being ejected from Mesopotamia by the Sumerians during the Neo-Sumerian Empire ( 2112-2004 BC ) . The city later came to be dominated by the Hurrians from eastern Anatolia before being incorporated into the Old Assyrian Empire ( 2025-1750 BC ) , after which Arrapha and the whole of northern Mesopotamia became a part of Assyria proper . During the late 15th century BC Assyria and Arrapha was under the domination of the short-lived Mittani-Hurrian empire , but after the Assyrians overthrew and destroyed the Hurri-Mitanni in the early 14th century BC the city was once more under Assyrian rule . Arrapha remained an important Assyrian city until the fall of the Assyrian empire between 615-599 BC . After this it remained a part of the geo-political province of Assyria ( Achaemenid Assyria , Athura , Seleucid Syria , Assyria ( Roman province ) and Assuristan ) under various foreign empires , and between the 2nd century BC and 3rd century AD became the capital of the Neo-Assyrian state of Beth Garmai before this was conquered into the Sassanid empire and became a part of Assuristan .

  "/wiki/Insurgency": "An insurgency is a violent rebellion against authority ( for example , an authority recognized as such by the United Nations ) when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents ( lawful combatants ) . An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare , and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population and by political and economic actions of various kinds , as well as propaganda aimed at undermining the insurgents ' claims against the incumbent regime . As a concept , insurgency 's nature is ambiguous . Not all rebellions are insurgencies . There have been many cases of non-violent rebellions , using civil resistance , as in the People Power Revolution in the Philippines in the 1980s that ousted President Marcos and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 . Where a revolt takes the form of armed rebellion , it may not be viewed as an insurgency if a state of belligerency exists between one or more sovereign states and rebel forces . For example , during the American Civil War , the Confederate States of America was not recognized as a sovereign state , but it was recognized as a belligerent power , and thus Confederate warships were given the same rights as United States warships in foreign ports . When insurgency is used to describe a movement 's unlawfulness by virtue of not being authorized by or in accordance with the law of the land , its use is neutral . However , when it is used by a state or another authority under threat , insurgency often also carries an implication that the rebels ' cause is illegitimate , whereas those rising up will see the authority of the state as being illegitimate . Criticisms of widely held ideas and actions about insurgency started to occur in works of the 1960s ; they are still common in recent studies . Sometimes there may be one or more simultaneous insurgencies ( multipolar ) occurring in a country . The Iraq insurgency is one example of a recognized government versus multiple groups of insurgents .",

  "/wiki/Nurse": "Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals , families , and communities so they may attain , maintain , or recover optimal health and quality of life . Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice . Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority . Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers . However , nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings . Since the postwar period , nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing . Nurses develop a plan of care , working collaboratively with physicians , therapists , the patient , the patient 's family , and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life . In the United States and the United Kingdom , advanced practice nurses , such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners , diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies , depending on individual state regulations . Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists , medical practitioners , and dietitians .

  "/wiki/Lethal_injection": "Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person ( typically a barbiturate , paralytic , and potassium solution ) for the express purpose of causing rapid death . The main application for this procedure is capital punishment , but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and other forms of suicide . The drugs cause the person to become unconscious , stops their breathing , and causes a heart arrhythmia , in that order . First developed in the United States , it is now also a legal method of execution in China , Thailand , Guatemala , Taiwan , the Maldives , Nigeria and Vietnam , though Guatemala has not conducted an execution since 2000 and the Maldives has never carried out an execution since its independence . Although Taiwan permits lethal injection as an execution method , no executions have been carried out in this manner , most likely due to drug shortages ; the same is true for Nigeria . Lethal injection was also used in the Philippines until the country re-abolished the death penalty in 2006 .",

  "/wiki/Terminally_ill": "Terminal illness or end-stage disease is a disease that can not be cured or adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in death of the patient . This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease than for trauma . In popular use , it indicates a disease that will progress until death with near absolute certainty , regardless of treatment . A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient , terminally ill or simply terminal . There is no standardized life expectancy for a patient to be considered terminal , although it is generally months or less . Life expectancy for terminal patients is a rough estimate given by the physician based on previous data and does not always reflect true longevity . An illness which is lifelong but not fatal is a chronic condition . Terminal patients have options for disease management after diagnosis . Examples include caregiving , continued treatment , hospice care , and physician-assisted suicide . Decisions regarding management are made by the patient and his or her family , although medical professionals may give recommendations or more about the services available to terminal patients . Lifestyle after diagnosis largely varies depending on management decisions and also the nature of the disease , and there may be living restrictions depending on the condition of the patient . Oftentimes , terminal patients may experience depression or anxiety associated with oncoming death , and family and caregivers may struggle with psychological burdens as well ."
