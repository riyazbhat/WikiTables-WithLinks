  "/wiki/Genre": "Genre ( Pronounced / ( d ) \u0292\u0251n.\u0279\u0259/ ) ( from French genre , meaning 'kind , sort ' ) is any form or type of communication in any mode ( written , spoken , digital , artistic , etc . ) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time . Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature , music , or other forms of art or entertainment , whether written or spoken , audio or visual , based on some set of stylistic criteria , yet genres can be aesthetic , rhetorical , communicative , or functional . Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones . Often , works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions . Stand-alone texts , works , or pieces of communication may have individual styles , but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions . Some genres may have rigid , strictly adhered-to guidelines , while others may show great flexibility . Genre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature , as set out in Aristotle 's Poetics . For Aristotle , poetry ( odes , epics , etc . ) , prose , and performance each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre . Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy , for example , and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best .

Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical , modern , and jazz styles , it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance . Due to its technical similarities , it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance , ballet , and other classical concert dance styles . In terms of the focus of its technique , contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso . It also employs contract-release , floor work , fall and recovery , and improvisation characteristics of modern dance . Unpredictable changes in rhythm , speed , and direction are often used , as well . Additionally , contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures , such as elements from African dance including bent knees , or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance , Butoh .",
