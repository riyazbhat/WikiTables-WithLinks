  "/wiki/Chatterbot": "A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods . Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner , although as of 2019 , they are far short of being able to pass the Turing test . Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition . Some chatbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems , but many simpler ones scan for keywords within the input , then pull a reply with the most matching keywords , or the most similar wording pattern , from a database . The term ChatterBot was originally coined by Michael Mauldin ( creator of the first Verbot , Julia ) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs . Today , most chatbots are accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa , via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat , or via individual organizations ' apps and websites . Chatbots can be classified into usage categories that include conversational commerce ( e-commerce via chat ) , education , entertainment , finance , health , news , and productivity . Beyond chatbots , Conversational AI refers to the use of messaging apps , speech-based assistants and chatbots to automate communication and create personalized customer experiences at scale",

In interface design , natural-language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use , but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input . Natural-language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural-language processing and computational linguistics . An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web . Text interfaces are natural to varying degrees . Many formal ( un-natural ) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language .
