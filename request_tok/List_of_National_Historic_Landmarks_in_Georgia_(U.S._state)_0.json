  "/wiki/Greek_Revival": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland",

  "/wiki/Calhoun_Mine": "The Calhoun Mine is perhaps the oldest and best-known mine in Lumpkin County , Georgia . When gold was discovered in Lumpkin County in 1828 , which led to the Georgia Gold Rush in 1829 , it was discovered on 239 acres ( 0.97 km2 ) owned by Robert Obar . After at least two intermediary sales , the land was purchased by Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina , who was also the 7th Vice President of the United States . Calhoun started a mining company to mine the land and later allowed his son-in-law Thomas Green Clemson , the founder of Clemson University , to manage it . The ore deposit was a very rich deposit and , according to an 1856 letter from Clemson to his brother-in-law , was still producing significant quantities of gold nearly 30 years after its initial discovery on the land . This mine - along with the Consolidated Mine and the Loud Mine - were some of the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt . In 1879 , the Calhoun Mine passed from the Calhoun family . In 1939 , after the deposits at the Calhoun Mine were long thought to be depleted , a small pocket was discovered and mined . After that excitement , things became quiet once again at the mine .

The Cherokee have come to call the event Nu na da ul tsun yi ( the place where they cried ) ; another term is Tlo va sa ( our removal ) - both phrases not used at the time , and seems to be of Choctaw origin . Removal actions ( voluntary , reluctantly or forcibly ) occurred to other American Indian groups in the American South , North , Midwest , Southwest , and the Plains regions . The Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek , Cherokee and ( Muskogee ) were removed reluctantly . The Seminole in Florida resisted removal by the United States Army for decades ( 1817-1850 ) with guerrilla warfare , part of the intermittent Native American Wars that lasted from 1540 to 1924 . Some Seminole remained in their Florida home country , while others were transported to Native American Territory in shackles .

He is remembered for strongly defending slavery and for advancing the concept of minority rights in politics , which he did in the context of protecting the interests of the white South when it was outnumbered by Northerners . He began his political career as a nationalist , modernizer , and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs . In the late 1820s , his views changed radically , and he became a leading proponent of states ' rights , limited government , nullification , and opposition to high tariffs - he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as a condition of the South remaining in the Union . His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South 's secession from the Union in 1860-1861 . Calhoun began his political career with election to the House of Representatives in 1810 . As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction , Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against British infractions of American independence and neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars . He then served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe , and in this position reorganized and modernized the War Department . Calhoun was a candidate for the presidency in the 1824 election . After failing to gain support , he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president .
