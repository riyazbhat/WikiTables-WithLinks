  "/wiki/Ontario_Highway_400": "King 's Highway 400 , commonly referred to as Highway 400 , historically as the Toronto-Barrie Highway , and colloquially as the 400 , is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario linking the city of Toronto in the urban and agricultural south of the province with the scenic and sparsely populated central and northern regions . The portion of the highway between Toronto and Lake Simcoe roughly traces the route of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail , a historic trail between the Lower and Upper Great Lakes . North of Highway 12 , in combination with Highway 69 , it forms a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway , the Georgian Bay Route , and is part of the highest-capacity route from southern Ontario to the Canadian West , via a connection with the mainline of the TCH in Sudbury . The highway also serves as the primary route from Toronto to southern Georgian Bay and Muskoka , areas collectively known as cottage country . The highway is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) , except for the section south of the 401 , where the speed limit is 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) . Highway 400 is the second longest freeway in the province , the trans-provincial Highway 401 being the longest . It was the first fully controlled-access highway in Ontario when it was opened between North York and Barrie on July 1 , 1952 . On that date , it was also the first highway to be designated as a 400-series . The freeway was extended in both directions ; north of Barrie to Coldwater in 1958 , and south of Highway 401 to Jane Street in 1966 . It was widened between North York and Barrie in the 1970s . Since 1977 , construction on the freeway has been snaking north along Highway 69 towards Parry Sound and Sudbury . As of 2011 , a four lane freeway is opened as far north as Carling ; at that point , the four lanes narrow into two and continue northerly to Sudbury as Highway 69",
  "/wiki/Toronto": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 . Current to 2016 , the Toronto census metropolitan area ( CMA ) , of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , held a population of 5,928,040 , making it Canada 's most populous CMA . The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants",

It is part of the Trans-Canada Highway and the National Highway System . From its northerly terminus at Sudbury , the highway is a four-lane undivided route running for several kilometres before dividing into a freeway south of Crown Ridge . As of July 2016 , this freeway segment extends south 49 km to a point 5 km north of the French River . From there , the route narrows to a two-lane highway to its southerly terminus , located three kilometres north of Highway 559 at Carling . At this terminus , the roadway widens back into a freeway and changes its designation to Highway 400 . South of this point , various former alignments of Highway 69 remain in use as directional carriageways of Highway 400 or as local roads . The highway forms part of the Georgian Bay Route of the Trans-Canada Highway , which continues south along Highway 400 . Highway 69 was first designated in 1936 when the Department of Highways ( DHO ) assumed the Rama Road between Atherley and Washago . This short route was expanded the following year when the DHO merged with the Department of Northern Development and expanded the King 's Highway network north of the Severn River . By the beginning of World War II , the route reached as far north as Britt ; a separate segment connected the town of Burwash with Sudbury . However , the rationing of labour and materials due to the war effort resulted in these two sections remaining separated until the mid-1950s",

A small disconnected signed section of the highway still remains within the Ottawa Region between County Road 29 and Grants Side Rd . This makes it Ontario 's longest highway . [ note 1 ] The highway once extended even farther to the Quebec boundary in East Hawkesbury with a peak length of about 2,180 km ( 1,350 mi ) . However , a section of Highway 17 disappeared when the Ottawa section of it was upgraded to the freeway Highway 417 in 1971 . Highway 17 was not re-routed through Ottawa , nor did it share numbering with Highway 417 to rectify the discontinuity , even though Highway 417 formed a direct link between the western and eastern sections of Highway 17 . However , from East Hawkesbury to Ottawa , Highway 17 retained the Trans-Canada Highway routing and signs until it met up again and merged with Highway 417 until 1997 when Highway 17 through Ottawa was downgraded . The Trans-Canada Highway designation now extends along all of Highway 417 . Ontario Highway 17 is a very important part of the national highway system in Canada , as it is the sole highway linking the eastern and western regions of the country . Although other small roads connect the province of Ontario with the province of Manitoba , it is the only major highway that links the two , making it a crucial section of Canada 's primary commercial and leisure route for all traffic travelling between Canada 's largest cities , from Toronto and Montreal in the east to Calgary and Vancouver in the west",

It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships . Being located inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) . The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25 % of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore . Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail , economic , health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario",

The speed limit is 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) throughout its length , with the only exceptions the posted 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) limit westbound in Windsor and in most construction zones . By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered Highway 401 : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario-Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque-Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length .

Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River , which forms the Canada-United States border , directly across from Port Huron , Michigan . The site 's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle . He named the site The Rapids on 23 August 1679 , when he had horses and men pull his 45-ton barque Le Griffon north against the nearly four-knot current of the St. Clair River . This was the first time that a vessel other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron , and La Salle 's voyage was germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes . Located in the natural harbour , the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products . The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas , together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 , led to the dramatic growth of the petroleum industry in this area . Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil , the knowledge that was acquired there resulted in oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other enterprises and nations how to drill for oil . The complex of refining and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia .

The history of the QEW dates back to 1931 , when work began to widen the Middle Road in a similar fashion to the nearby Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression . Following the 1934 provincial election , Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy minister Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany , dividing the opposite directions of travel and using grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads . When opened to traffic in 1937 , it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world . While not a true freeway at the time , it was gradually upgraded , widened , and modernized beginning in the 1950s , more or less taking on its current form by 1975 .

As of July 2016 the city has a population of 531,902 , and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296 . It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada . The Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec , an Algonquin [ note 1 ] word meaning where the river narrows , because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant . Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608 , and adopted the Algonquin name . Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America . The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec ( Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec ) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico . This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec . The city 's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec , an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence . The National Assembly of Quebec ( provincial legislature ) , the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec ( National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec ) , and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation ( Museum of Civilization ) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec",

  "/wiki/Ontario_Highway_420": "King 's Highway 420 , commonly referred to as Highway 420 , is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) with downtown Niagara Falls . It continues east as a limited-access expressway named Niagara Regional Road 420 to connect with the Rainbow Bridge international crossing between Canada and the United States over the Niagara River ; this was part of Highway 420 until 1998 . West of the QEW , the freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Montrose Road ( Niagara Regional Road 98 ) . The highway has a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) , making it the only 400-series highway to have a speed limit less than 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) for its entirety . Originally constructed as a divided four-lane road with two roundabouts , the route of Highway 420 formed part of the QEW between 1941 and 1972 ; then this segment was bypassed by an extension of the QEW to Fort Erie , resulting in the bypassed spur being assigned a unique route number . This re-designation took place during the reconstruction of the four-lane divided highway into a freeway and the construction of the large interchange at the freeway 's western terminus . In 1998 , the section of Highway 420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Regional Road 420",

  "/wiki/Ontario_Highway_427": "King 's Highway 427 ( pronounced four twenty-seven ) , also known as Highway 427 and colloquially as the 427 , is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) and Gardiner Expressway in Toronto to Highway 401 and with York Regional Road 7 ( formerly Highway 7 ) further north in the City of Vaughan . An arterial extension , known as York Regional Road 99 , continues 800 metres ( 2,600 ft ) north to Zenway Boulevard . It is Ontario 's second busiest freeway by volume and third busiest in North America , behind Highway 401 and Interstate 405 in California . Like Highway 401 , a portion of the route is divided into a collector-express system with twelve to fourteen continuous lanes . Notable about Highway 427 are its several multi-level interchanges ; the junctions with the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway 401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971 , while the interchanges with Highway 409 and Highway 407 were completed in 1992 and 1995 , respectively . Highway 427 is the main feeder to Toronto Pearson International Airport from the north and south . However , while much of the traffic from Highway 407 , Highway 401 ( eastbound ) , and the QEW/Gardiner Expressway makes use of the freeway for airport access , it also serves as a major traffic route for the western portion of Toronto ( Etobicoke ) , the northeastern portion of Mississauga ( Malton ) , the southeastern portion of Brampton ( Claireville ) , and the western portion of Vaughan ( Woodbridge ) . The section between Highway 401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor ; the 1.61-kilometre ( 1.00 mi ) stretch between Burnhamthorpe and Rathburn saw an average of over 400,000 vehicles and over 5,000 buses per day in 2016 . GO Transit , MiWay , and the Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) all operate express buses along this section of the highway . First designated in 1972 , Highway 427 assumed the recently-completed 12-lane collector-express freeway of Highway 27 , as well as a short freeway north of Highway 401 known as the Airport Expressway . Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s , eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972 . The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway 7 over the following twenty years",

East of Dufferin Street to just east of the Don River , the roadway is elevated for a length of 6.8 kilometres ( 4.2 mi ) , unofficially making it the longest bridge in Ontario . It runs above Lake Shore Boulevard east of Spadina Avenue . The highway is named after the first chair of the now-defunct Metro Council , Frederick G. Gardiner . The six-lane section east of the Humber River was built in segments from 1955 until 1964 by the Metropolitan Toronto government with provincial highway funds . The ten-lane section west of the Humber was formerly part of the QEW . The Gardiner Expressway is wholly owned and operated by the City of Toronto . The condition of the highway has deteriorated over the years . The highway has been described as an out-of-date , crumbling and frequently traffic-jammed freeway . Extensive repairs became necessary in the early 1990s , and significant commercial and residential development has occurred in the core . As a result of these , the Gardiner has been the subject of several proposals to demolish it or move it underground as part of downtown waterfront revitalization efforts",
  "/wiki/Ontario_Highway_7": "King 's Highway 7 , commonly referred to as Highway 7 and The 7 historically as the Northern Highway , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . At its peak , Highway 7 measured 716 km ( 445 mi ) in length , stretching from Highway 40 east of Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario to Highway 17 west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario . However , due in part to the construction of Highways 402 and 407 , the province transferred the sections of Highway 7 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction . The highway is now 535.7 km ( 332.9 mi ) long ; the western segment begins at Highway 4 north of London and extends 154.1 km ( 95.8 mi ) to Georgetown , while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends 381.6 km ( 237.1 mi ) to Highway 417 in Ottawa . Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year . Between 1927 and 1932 , the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth , where Highway 15 continued to Ottawa . In the early 1960s , that section of Highway 15 was renumbered as Highway 7 . In that same decade , the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed . During the 1970s and 1980s , many sections of Highway 7 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes . Within York Region , the route was upgraded to a limited-access expressway in preparation for the construction of Highway 407 . Soon thereafter , that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway 7 through the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) to regional governments . In the west , the construction of Highway 402 between Sarnia and London provided an uninterrupted alternative to Highway 7 , resulting in the transfer of the section west of Highway 4",
