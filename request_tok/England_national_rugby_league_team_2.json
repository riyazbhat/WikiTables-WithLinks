  "/wiki/Five-eighth": "Five-eighth or Stand-off is one of the positions in a rugby league football team . Wearing jersey number 6 , this player is one of the two half backs in a team , partnering the scrum-half . Sometimes known as the pivot or second receiver , in a traditional attacking 'back-line ' ( \u2116 1-7 ) play , the five-eighth would receive the ball from the scrum half , who is the first receiver of the ball from the dummy-half or hooker following a tackle . The role of the five-eighth is often to pass the ball away from the congested area around the tackle , further out along the 'back-line ' to the outside backs , the centres and wingers , who have more space to run with it . Furthermore , players in this position typically assume responsibility for kicking the ball for field position in general play . The five-eighth is therefore considered one of the most important positions , often referred to as a 'play maker ' , assuming a decision-making role on the field . Over time , however , as the game has evolved , the roles of the two halves have grown more aligned and difficult to distinguish . Along with other key positions - fullback , hooker and scrum half - the five-eighth makes up what is known as a team 's spine . One book published in 1996 stated that in senior rugby league , the five-eighth and hooker handled the ball more often than any other positions . The Rugby League International Federation 's Laws of the Game state that the Stand-off half or Five-eighth is to be numbered 6 . However , traditionally players ' jersey numbers have varied , and in the modern Super League , each squad 's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position",

  "/wiki/Wing": "A wing is a type of fin that produces lift , while moving through air or some other fluid . As such , wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils . A wing 's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio . The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing . A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift . Lifting structures used in water , include various foils , such as hydrofoils . Hydrodynamics is the governing science , rather than aerodynamics . Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes , sailboats and submarines",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(rugby_league)": "Fullback ( or full-back ) is one of the positions in a rugby league football team . Typically wearing jersey number 1 , the fullback is a member of the team 's 'back-line ' ( No . 1-7 ) . The position 's name comes from their duty of standing the furthest back in defence , behind the forwards ( 8-13 ) , half backs ( 6 and 7 ) and the three-quarter backs ( 2-5 ) . Fullbacks are therefore the last line of defence , having to tackle any opposition players and regather the ball from any kicks that make it through their teammates . It is for this reason that the fullback is also referred to as the sweeper or custodian . Being able to secure high bomb kicks is a highly sought quality in fullbacks . Fullback is also one of the most important positions in attack , handling the ball nearly every set of six and often running into open space on the field . Therefore , together with the two half backs and hooker , fullback is one of the four key positions that make up what is referred to as a team 's 'spine ' . Because the fullback makes the most support runs , players in the fullback role complete more very high-intensity running than any other position . The Rugby League International Federation 's Laws of the Game state that the 'fullback ' is to be numbered 1 . However , traditionally players ' jersey numbers have varied , and in the modern Super League , each squad 's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position",

  "/wiki/Scrum-half_(rugby_league)": "A rugby league team consists of thirteen players on the field , with four substitutes on the bench . Each of the thirteen players is assigned a position , normally with a standardised number , which reflects their role in attack and defence , although players can take up any position at any time . Players are divided into two general types , forwards and backs . Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength . They are expected to run with the ball , to attack , and to make tackles . Forwards are required to improve the team 's field position thus creating space and time for the backs . Backs are usually smaller and faster , though a big , fast player can be of advantage in the backs . Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills , rather than just strength , to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards . Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field , while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines , where more space can usually be found"
