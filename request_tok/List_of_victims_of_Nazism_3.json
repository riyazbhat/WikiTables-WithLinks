  "/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp": "The Auschwitz concentration camp ( Konzentrationslager Auschwitz ) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust . It consisted of Auschwitz I , the main camp ( Stammlager ) in O\u015bwi\u0119cim ; Auschwitz II-Birkenau , a concentration and extermination camp built with several gas chambers ; Auschwitz III-Monowitz , a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben ; and dozens of subcamps . The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died . The death toll includes 960,000 Jews ( 865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival ) , 74,000 non-Jewish Poles , 21,000 Roma , 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and up to 15,000 other Europeans . Those not gassed died of starvation , exhaustion , disease , individual executions , or beatings . Others were killed during medical experiments . At least 802 prisoners tried to escape , 144 successfully , and on 7 October 1944 two Sonderkommando units , consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers , launched an unsuccessful uprising .",

The camp was established and operated solely by the governing Usta\u0161e regime rather than by Nazi Germany as in the rest of occupied Europe . It was one of the largest concentration camps in Europe and it has been referred to as the Auschwitz of the Balkans and the Yugoslav Auschwitz . It was established in August 1941 in marshland at the confluence of the Sava and Una rivers near the village of Jasenovac , and was dismantled in April 1945 . It was notorious for its barbaric practices and the large number of victims . In Jasenovac the majority of victims were ethnic Serbs ( as part of the Genocide of the Serbs ) ; others were Jews ( The Holocaust ) , Roma ( The Porajmos ) , and some political dissidents . Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps spread over 210 km2 ( 81 sq mi ) on both banks of the Sava and Una rivers . The largest camp was the Brickworks camp at Jasenovac , about 100 km ( 62 mi ) southeast of Zagreb . The overall complex included the Stara Gradi\u0161ka sub-camp , the killing grounds across the Sava river at Donja Gradina , five work farms , and the U\u0161tica Roma camp . During and since World War II , there has been much debate and controversy regarding the number of victims killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp complex during its more than three-and-a-half years of operation . After the war , a figure of 700,000 reflected the conventional wisdom , although estimates have gone as high as 1.4 million . The authorities of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia conducted a population survey in 1964 that resulted in a list of 59,188 victims of Jasenovac and Stara Gradi\u0161ka , the findings were not published until 1989 .",

  "/wiki/Theresienstadt_concentration_camp": "Theresienstadt ( Czech : Terez\u00edn [ \u02c8t\u025br\u025bzi\u02d0n ] ) was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town Terez\u00edn , located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ( a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia ) . Theresienstadt served two main purposes : it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps , and a retirement settlement for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution . Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners , and the ghetto also served a propaganda role . Unlike other ghettos , the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant . The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941 . The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942 ; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war . About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt , mostly from malnutrition and disease . More than 88,000 people were held there for months or years before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites ; the Jewish self-administration 's role in choosing those to be deported has attracted significant controversy . Including 4,000 of the deportees who survived , the total number of survivors was around 23,000 . Theresienstadt was known for its relatively rich cultural life , including concerts , lectures , and clandestine education for children . The fact that it was governed by a Jewish self-administration as well as the large number of prominent Jews imprisoned there facilitated the flourishing of cultural life . This spiritual legacy has attracted the attention of scholars and sparked interest in the ghetto .",

  "/wiki/F\u00fcrstengrube_subcamp": "The F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp was organized in the summer of 1943 at the F\u00fcrstengrube hard coal mine in the town of Weso\u0142a ( Wessolla ) near Myslowice ( Myslowitz ) , approximately 30 kilometers ( 19 mi ) from Auschwitz concentration camp . The mine , which IG Farbenindustrie AG acquired in February 1941 , was to supply hard coal for the IG Farben factory being built in Auschwitz . Besides the old F\u00fcrstengrube mine , called the Altanlage , a new mine ( F\u00fcrstengrube-Neuanlage ) had been designed and construction had begun ; it was to provide for greater coal output in the future . Coal production at the new mine was anticipated to start in late 1943 , so construction was treated as very urgent ; however , that plan proved to be unfeasible . In the period before the Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners were sent to work at F\u00fcrstengrube , the mine employed Soviet prisoners of war , Jewish slave laborers , and forced laborers from the USSR in addition to its regular staff . Negotiations in July 1943 between Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss and representatives of IG Farbenindustrie AG and F\u00fcrstengrube GmbH , led to an agreement to build a new camp for approximately 600 prisoners - increasing to 1,200-1,300 later - from Auschwitz . Mainly Jews built the new camp . They lived in the mine 's forced-labor camp for Jews , which was under the so-called Organisation Schmelt ; that camp was called Lager Ostland . The Jewish prisoners from that camp were taken away even before the prisoners were moved from the Auschwitz concentration camp . The camp report for August 1943 no longer mentions the number of Jews employed . The prisoners moved from Auschwitz then continued the subcamp 's construction and expansion . In early September 1943 , the SS began moving prisoners , probably including a few German prisoner foremen , from Auschwitz to the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp , which appears as Lager S\u00fcd on mine maps .",

The Einsatzgruppen were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia , including members of the priesthood and cultural elite of Poland , and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called Final Solution to the Jewish Question ( Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage ) in territories conquered by Nazi Germany . Almost all of the people they killed were civilians , beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars , Jews , and Romani people as well as actual or alleged partisans throughout Eastern Europe . Under the direction of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich , the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the Wehrmacht ( German armed forces ) following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 . The Einsatzgruppen worked hand-in-hand with the Order Police battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days , such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33,771 Jews killed in two days , and the Rumbula massacre ( with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting ) . As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler , the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen , providing logistical support for their operations , and participated in the mass killings . Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen , related agencies , and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people , including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the Holocaust . After the close of World War II , 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen trial in 1947-48 , charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes . Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out . Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations .",

It was located in the forest next to the railway station of Sobib\u00f3r within the semi-colonial territory of the General Government in occupied Poland . Unlike many other Nazi concentration camps , Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of exterminating Jews . Most new arrivals were immediately sent to the gas chambers , with rare exceptions being made for those who were forced to serve as slave labourers who assisted in the operation of the camp . Some 200,000 to 250,000 people were murdered at Sobibor , making it the fourth deadliest extermination camp after Belzec , Treblinka , and Auschwitz . Sobibor is notable for the prisoner revolt which occurred on 14 October 1943 , an event which is often described as the most successful revolt ever to have taken place in a Nazi extermination camp . The plan for the revolt , which was developed by Alexander Pechersky and Leon Feldhendler , involved two phases . In the first phase , teams of prisoners were to assassinate all of the on-duty SS officers in discrete locations . In the second phase , all 600 prisoners would assemble for roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate . However , the revolt did not go as planned . The operation was discovered while several SS officers were still alive and prisoners ended up having to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire . Even so , about 300 prisoners made it out of the camp , of whom roughly 60 survived to the end of the war .",

After the Grossaktion Warsaw of summer 1942 , in which more than a quarter of a million Jews were deported from the ghetto to Treblinka and murdered , the remaining Jews began to build bunkers and smuggle weapons and explosives into the ghetto . The left-wing Jewish Combat Organization ( \u017bOB ) and right-wing Jewish Military Union ( \u017bZW ) formed and began to train . A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred the Polish groups to support the Jews in earnest . The uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer J\u00fcrgen Stroop , who then ordered the burning of the ghetto , block by block , ending on 16 May . A total of 13,000 Jews died , about half of them burnt alive or suffocated . German casualties were probably less than 150 , [ citation needed ] with Stroop reporting only 110 casualties [ 16 killed + 1 dead/93 wounded ] .
