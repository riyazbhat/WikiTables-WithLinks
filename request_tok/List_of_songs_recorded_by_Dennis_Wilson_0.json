He was also known for his association with Charles Manson , a cult leader and songwriter later convicted of several murders , and for co-starring in the 1971 film Two-Lane Blacktop . Wilson served mainly on drums and backing vocals for the Beach Boys . His playing can be heard on many of the group 's hits , despite the popular misconception that he was always replaced on record by studio musicians . He originally had few lead vocals on the band 's songs , but his prominence as a singer-songwriter increased following their 1968 album Friends . His music is characterized for reflecting his edginess and little of his happy charm . His original songs for the group included Little Bird ( 1968 ) , Forever ( 1970 ) , and Slip On Through ( 1970 ) . Friends and biographers also say that he was an uncredited writer on You Are So Beautiful , a hit for Joe Cocker in 1974 . During his final years , Wilson struggled with drug addiction which contributed to tensions with his bandmates .

Among the band 's US Top 10 hits were the Wilson-Love songs Fun , Fun , Fun ( 1964 ) , California Girls ( 1965 ) , and Good Vibrations ( 1966 ) . Love 's lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , which helped fashion pop culture 's perception of the California Dream . Starting in 1968 , Love was a student of Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , and became a TM teacher in 1971 . The experience influenced his lyrics to take on themes of astrology , meditation , politics and ecology . In the late 1970s , Love began working on solo albums , releasing his first in 1981 : Looking Back with Love . In 1988 , Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , along with the other founding members of the Beach Boys .
