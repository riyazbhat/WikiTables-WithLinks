The park received 644,922 recreational visitors in 2018 . Typical visitor activities include sightseeing , photography , hiking , and backpacking . Averaging about 5,400 feet ( 1,600 m ) in elevation , the park has a dry windy climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about 100 \u00b0F ( 38 \u00b0C ) to winter lows well below freezing . More than 400 species of plants , dominated by grasses such as bunchgrass , blue grama , and sacaton , are found in the park . Fauna include larger animals such as pronghorns , coyotes , and bobcats , many smaller animals , such as deer mice , snakes , lizards , seven kinds of amphibians , and more than 200 species of birds , some of which are permanent residents and many of which are migratory . About one third of the park is designated wilderness - 50,260 acres ( 79 sq mi ; 203 km2 ) . The Petrified Forest is known for its fossils , especially fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic Epoch , about 225 million years ago . The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation , from which the Painted Desert gets its name",

The community center includes administrative facilities , utility structures and National Park Service employee housing , planned by architects Richard Neutra and Robert Alexander as part of the Mission 66 park facilities improvement program . Work on the community began in 1961 and was completed by 1965 . The complex contrasts with earlier Park Service architecture that sought to blend with the environment . The Painted Desert community used straight manufactured materials that deliberately draw a contrast with the natural environment . The most significant building is the Painted Desert Visitor Center , designed as a severely modernist structure that includes administrative offices. , a visitor center , an auditorium , a clinic and staff apartments . Other structures include a community center , school and a Fred Harvey Company concession building . Neutra and Alexander paid particular attention to the division of the complex into public and private areas , using low walls to divide the Park Service service area from the central zone , and setting the inward-facing residential areas at a distance . Pedestrian circulation paths are used as defining organizing elements . The original landscape design used non-native plants that required regular watering . Removal of irrigation caused these plants to die , altering the landscape . The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 , and was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2016",
