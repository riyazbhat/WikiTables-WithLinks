He was the gold medalist in the event at the 2011 Pan American Games . He represented his country at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics .",
  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/The_Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/Racewalking": "Racewalking , or race walking , is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics . Although it is a foot race , it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times . This is assessed by race judges . Typically held on either roads or on running tracks , common distances range from 3,000 metres ( 1.9 mi ) up to 100 kilometres ( 62.1 mi ) . There are two racewalking distances contested at the Summer Olympics : the 20 kilometres race walk ( men and women ) and 50 kilometres race walk ( men only ) . Both are held as road events . The biennial World Athletics Championships also features these three events , in addition to a 50 km walk for women . The IAAF World Race Walking Cup , first held in 1961 , is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes , in addition to the Olympic-standard events . The IAAF World Indoor Championships featured 5000 m and 3000 m race walk variations , but these were discontinued after 1993 . Top level athletics championships and games typically feature 20 km racewalking events . The sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism , which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century . Since the mid-20th century onwards , Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage , with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers .",

Ecuador also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific , about 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland . The capital city is Quito , which is also its largest city . The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . The sovereign state of Ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 18 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights . It also has the fifth lowest homicide rate in the Americas .",

For the race , ten hurdles of a height of 83.8 centimetres ( 33.0 in ) are placed along a straight course of 100 metres ( 109.36 yd ) . The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line . The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other , and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long . The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner , but weighted so this is disadvantageous . Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in starting blocks . The fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds . The world record set by Kendra Harrison stands at 12.20 seconds .",

Consisting of the main islands Trinidad and Tobago , and numerous much smaller islands , it is situated 130 kilometres ( 81 miles ) south of Grenada and 11 kilometres ( 6.8 miles ) off the coast of northeastern Venezuela . It shares maritime boundaries with Barbados to the northeast , Grenada to the northwest , Guyana to the southeast , and Venezuela to the south and west . The island of Trinidad was inhabited for centuries by native Amerindian peoples before becoming a colony in the Spanish Empire , following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498 . Spanish governor Don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chac\u00f3n surrendered the island to a British fleet under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797 . During the same period , the island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish , British , French , Dutch and Courlander colonisers more times than any other island in the Caribbean . [ citation needed ] Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889 . Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962 , becoming a republic in 1976 . Trinidad and Tobago has the third highest GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity ( PPP ) in the Americas after the United States and Canada . It is recognised by the World Bank as a high-income economy . Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories , which rely heavily on tourism , the Trinidadian economy is primarily industrial with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals ; much of the nation 's wealth is derived from its large reserves of oil and natural gas . Trinidad and Tobago is well known for its African and East Indian/South Asian cultures , reflected in its large and famous Carnival and Diwali celebrations , as well being the birthplace of steelpan , the limbo , and music styles such as calypso , soca , rapso , parang , chutney , and chutney soca .",

The first runners must begin in the same stagger as for the individual 400 m race . A relay baton is carried by each runner . Prior to 2018 , the baton had to be passed within a 20 m changeover box , preceded by a 10-metre acceleration zone . With a rule change effective November 1 , 2017 that zone was modified to include the acceleration zone as part of the passing zone , making the entire zone 30 metres in length . The outgoing runner can not touch the baton until it has entered the zone , the incoming runner can not touch the baton after it has left the zone . The zone is usually marked in yellow , frequently using lines , triangles or chevrons . While the rule book specifies the exact positioning of the marks , the colors and style are only recommended . While most legacy tracks will still have the older markings , the rule change still uses existing marks . Not all governing body jurisdictions have adopted the rule change . Transfer of the baton in this race is typically blind . The outgoing runner reaches a straight arm backwards when they enter the changeover box , or when the incoming runner makes a verbal signal .",
