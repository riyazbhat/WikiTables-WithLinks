  "/wiki/Off-White": "Shades of white are colors that differ only slightly from pure white . Variations of white include what are commonly termed off-white colors , which may be considered part of a neutral color scheme . In color theory , a shade is a pure color mixed with black ( or having a lower lightness ) . Strictly speaking , a shade of white would be a neutral beige . This article is also about off-white colors that vary from pure white in hue , and in chroma ( also called saturation , or intensity ) . Colors often considered shades of white include cream , eggshell , ivory , Navajo white , and vanilla . Even the lighting of a room , however , can cause a pure white to be perceived as off-white . Off-white colors were pervasively paired with beiges in the 1930s , and especially popular again from roughly 1955 to 1975 . Whiteness measures the degree to which a surface is white in colorimetry .",
