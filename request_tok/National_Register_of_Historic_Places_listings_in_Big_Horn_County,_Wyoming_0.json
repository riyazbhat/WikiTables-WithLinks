  "/wiki/Bad_Pass_Trail": "The Bad Pass Trail , also known as the Sioux Trail , was established by Native Americans on the border of present-day Montana and Wyoming as a means of access from the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming to Bison-hunting grounds in the Grapevine Creek area of Montana . Marked by stone cairns , the trail led across Bad Pass and was established in pre-Columbian times . After Europeans arrived in the area it was frequented by fur trappers and mountain men , beginning in 1824 . Trappers assembled pack trains at the junction of the Shoshone River and the Bighorn River , using the Bad Pass Trail to avoid Bighorn Canyon . The trail ended at the mouth of Grapevine Creek on the Bighorn , from which the pack train could float down the Bighorn on rafts to the Yellowstone River and then to the Missouri and on to St. Louis . Approximately three hundred cairns are known to exist along the trail , particularly in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The cairns are believed to have been built incrementally , with passer-by placing stones on the pile as a good luck offering . Much of the trail itself has been altered beyond recognition by the construction of an access road for area ranches . The trail runs along the western side of Bighorn Canyon . It is estimated to have been in use for ten to twelve thousand years . The trail features as many as one thousand tipi rings on either side of the trail , some of which have been evaluated by archeologists . The Bad Pass Trail was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29 , 1975 .",
  "/wiki/Bighorn_River": "The Bighorn River is a tributary of the Yellowstone , approximately 461 miles ( 742 km ) long , in the states of Wyoming and Montana in the western United States . The river was named in 1805 by fur trader Fran\u00e7ois Larocque for the bighorn sheep he saw along its banks as he explored the Yellowstone . The upper reaches of the Bighorn , south of the Owl Creek Mountains in Wyoming , are known as the Wind River . The two rivers are sometimes referred to as the Wind/Bighorn . The Wind River officially becomes the Bighorn River at the Wedding of the Waters , on the north side of the Wind River Canyon near the town of Thermopolis . From there , the river flows through the Bighorn Basin in north central Wyoming , passing through Thermopolis and Hot Springs State Park . At the border with Montana , the river turns northeast , and flows past the north end of the Bighorn Mountains , through the Crow Indian Reservation , where the Yellowtail Dam forms the Bighorn Lake reservoir . The reservoir and the surrounding canyon are part of the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The Little Bighorn River joins the Bighorn near the town of Hardin , Montana . Approximately fifty miles farther downriver , the Bighorn River ends where it joins the Yellowstone .",

  "/wiki/Bridger_Immigrant_Road-Dry_Creek_Crossing": "The Bridger Trail , also known as the Bridger Road and Bridger Immigrant Road , was an overland route connecting the Oregon Trail to the gold fields of Montana . Gold was discovered in Virginia City , Montana in 1863 , prompting settlers and prospectors to find a trail to travel from central Wyoming to Montana . In 1863 , John Bozeman and John Jacobs scouted the Bozeman Trail , which was a direct route to the Montana gold fields through the Powder River Country . At the time the region was controlled by the Sioux , Cheyenne and Arapaho , who stepped up their raids in response to the stream of settlers along the trail . In 1864 the commandant of Fort Laramie , Colonel William O. Collins , concerned about the hostilities along the Bozeman Trail , asked Jim Bridger to lead a party of settlers from Denver on a new route to the mines through the Big Horn Basin along the western edge of the Big Horn Mountains . In 1859 , Bridger had guided a topographical expedition through the area , and knew the region well . The road ran approximately 425 miles ( 684 km ) , paralleling the Bozeman Trail and running to the west of the Bighorn Mountains in the lands of the Crow and Shoshone people . In all , 10 wagon trains made the trip in spring and summer of 1864 , two of them guided personally by Bridger . The following year , hostilities along the Bozeman Trail had escalated to the point where Major General Grenville M. Dodge ordered Brigadier General Patrick E. Connor to lead the first Powder River Expedition to try to end the raids along the trail . Connor chose Bridger as one of his guides , and Bridger spent the next few years guiding various military excursions into the Powder River Country and never again led settlers along the Bridger Trail .",
