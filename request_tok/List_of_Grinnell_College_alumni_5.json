  "/wiki/The_Guardian": "The Guardian is a British daily newspaper . It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian , and changed its name in 1959 . Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly , The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group , owned by the Scott Trust . The trust was created in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference . The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008 , with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators . Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders . The editor in chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015 . Since 2018 , the paper 's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format . As of November that year , its print edition had a daily circulation of 136,834 . The newspaper has an online edition , TheGuardian.com , as well as two international websites , Guardian Australia ( founded in 2013 ) and Guardian US ( founded in 2011 ) . The paper 's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion , and its reputation as a platform for liberal and left-wing editorial has led to the use of the Guardian reader and Guardianista as often-pejorative epithets for those of left-leaning or politically correct tendencies . Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting paper led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the Grauniad in the 1960s , a nickname still used today .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

  "/wiki/Podcast": "A podcast is an episodic series of digital audio files that a user can download in order to listen . With the emphasis on audio and the spoken word , podcasting shares roots with traditional radio programming , but with a different distribution model , involving computer networks and stored files . Podcasting grew out of the advent of portable media players such as Apple 's iPod where it became convenient to carry around a queue of preferred audio content ( other than music ) to consume during personal dead time , such as commuting to and from work . Software such as iTunes provided a convenient and integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and potential playback devices . Usually a podcast series features one or more recurring hosts engaged in discussion about some topic or current event . In highly produced podcasts , the discussion may be carefully scripted , almost to the point of being short oral essays , combined with elaborate and artistic sound production , with thematic concerns ranging from science reporting to slice-of-life journalism . Another common format is the talking head interview . In the simplest form , each episode features an audio interview between the recurring host and one special guest , anchored around one explicit subject matter , though the discussion might be free ranging . The sound production might be limited to a few seconds of introductory theme music , perhaps an introductory preamble to introduce the show or the guest , and then the interview with no other audio component beyond recorded speech . These are often exploratory podcasts based on expertise or opinion . More elaborate examples might involve multiple hosts or multiple guests ; there may be a live audience ; the hosts and guests may be constituted as a panel with a moderator ; there might be question period at the end , or other forms of audience interaction .",
