  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors": "The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ( LAC BOS ) is the five-member governing body of Los Angeles County , California , United States . The people of Los Angeles County on April 1 , 1850 asserted their newly won right of self-government and elected a three-man Court of Sessions as their first governing body . A total of 377 votes were cast in this election . In 1852 , the Legislature dissolved the Court of Sessions and created a five-member Board of Supervisors . In 1913 the citizens of Los Angeles County approved a charter recommended by a board of freeholders which gave the County greater freedom to govern itself within the framework of state law . As the population expanded throughout the twentieth century , Los Angeles County did not subdivide into separate counties or increase the number of supervisors as its population soared . As a result , the concentration of local administrative power in each county supervisor is high with the population of the county at ten million residents . Each supervisor represents more than two million people . A local nickname some use for the Board is the five little kings .",

Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier , originally called Takhoma or Tahoma . It is locally known as the City of Destiny because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century . The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma 's neighboring deep-water harbor , Commencement Bay . By connecting the bay with the railroad , Tacoma 's motto became When rails meet sails . Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma , a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington 's largest port . Like most industrial cities , Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment . Since the 1990s , downtown Tacoma has undergone a slow and steady revitalization .",

The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

Mississippi is bordered to the north by Tennessee , to the east by Alabama , to the south by the Gulf of Mexico , to the southwest by Louisiana , and to the northwest by Arkansas . Mississippi 's western boundary is largely defined by the Mississippi River . Jackson is both the state 's capital and largest city . Greater Jackson , with an estimated population of 580,166 in 2018 , is the most populous metropolitan area in Mississippi and the 95th-most populous in the United States . On December 10 , 1817 , Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union . By 1860 , Mississippi was the nation 's top cotton producing state and enslaved persons accounted for 55 % of the state population . Mississippi declared its secession from the Union on March 23 , 1861 , and was one of the seven original Confederate States . Following the Civil War , it was restored to the Union on February 23 , 1870 . Until the Great Migration of the 1930s , African Americans were a majority of Mississippi 's population . Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the American Civil Rights movement , including the 1962 Ole Miss riots , the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers , and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders .",
  "/wiki/Majority_leader": "In U.S. politics , the majority floor leader is a partisan position in a legislative body . In the federal Congress , the role of the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate differ slightly . In the United States Senate , the majority leader is the chief spokesperson for the majority party , as the president of the Senate is also the Vice-President of the United States , and the President pro tempore , though technically a substitute for the president of the Senate , is in reality a largely ceremonial position . In the United States House of Representatives , the majority leader is elected by U.S. Congresspeople in the political party holding the largest number of seats in the House . While the responsibilities vary depending upon the political climate , the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives typically sets the floor agenda and oversees the committee chairmen . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the majority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The majority leader is often assisted in their role by whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote in a way not approved of by the party . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) if the party line is violated ; decisions such as these are often made by the majority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In the states , the majority leader of a state legislative chamber usually performs a similar role to the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives . State senate presidents pro tempore are typically not ceremonial , but more akin to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Idaho": "Idaho ( /\u02c8a\u026ad\u0259ho\u028a/ ( listen ) ) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast , Wyoming to the east , Nevada and Utah to the south , and Washington and Oregon to the west . To the north , it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia . With a population of approximately 1.7 million and an area of 83,569 square miles ( 216,440 km2 ) , Idaho is the 14th largest , the 12th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states . The state 's capital and largest city is Boise . Idaho prior to European settlement was inhabited by Native American peoples , some of whom still live in the area . In the early 19th century , Idaho was considered part of the Oregon Country , an area disputed between the U.S. and the United Kingdom . It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 , but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863 , instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory . Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3 , 1890 , becoming the 43rd state . Forming part of the Pacific Northwest ( and the associated Cascadia bioregion ) , Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions . The state 's north , the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle , is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone - the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone . The state 's south includes the Snake River Plain ( which has most of the population and agricultural land ) .",

The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years .",
