In an interview with film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum , Ruiz calls Shattered Image an American accident . He explains some of his opinions and experiences of the top to down disconnected filmmaking process in America . Ruiz says , Shattered Image , I fought to make , and I now have a film about what it means to make a film in America - why American movies are the way they are . It 's a very strange film because I thought about it in the terms of American movies . In the American cinema there are good guys and bad guys . The good guys are the artists , let 's say the filmmakers , and the bad guys are the actors , sometimes the producers . I found new bad guys , who were the technicians , the workers , who were so obviously disconnected with the project , with the story of the movie . In France , you can get a good price from an electrician if he likes a script , if he finds it interesting and not very commercial he can , lets say , work Saturdays for free . And I thought that the relationship with the producer was ambiguous because he had the money coming from everywhere and he had to deal with those other producers , and everyone had a very precise idea about the movie .",
