  "/wiki/Offensive_Coordinator": "An offensive coordinator is a member of the coaching staff of an American football or Canadian football team who is in charge of the team 's offense . Generally , along with the defensive coordinator , he represents the second level of command structure after the head coach . The offensive coordinator is in charge of the team 's offensive game plan , and typically calls offensive plays during the game , although some offensive-minded head coaches also handle play-calling . Several position coaches work under the coordinator ( position groupings can include quarterbacks , wide receivers , offensive line , running backs , and tight ends ) . The coordinator may also coach a position ( typically quarterbacks ) . Unlike most position coaches in football , who are usually on the sidelines during games , offensive coordinators have the option of operating from the press box instead of being on the sideline . There are advantages and disadvantages to both locations . Since 2009 , nearly 40% of head coaches hired in the NFL had been serving as offensive coordinators .",

  "/wiki/Defensive_Coordinator": "A defensive coordinator is a coach responsible for a gridiron football ( American football ) team 's defense . Generally , the defensive coordinator and the offensive coordinator represent the second level of a team 's command structure , with the head coach being the first level . The primary role of the defensive coordinator is managing the roster of defensive players , overseeing the assistant coaches , developing the defensive game plan , and calling plays for the defense during the game . The defensive coordinator typically manages multiple assistant coaches , each of whom are responsible for various defensive positions on the team ( such as the defensive line , linebackers , or defensive backs ) . While the job of defensive coordinator is largely similar at the collegiate and professional level , college coaches are more involved in the recruitment process . A successful defensive coordinator is often a stepping stone to the position of head coach . Other major sports with strong delineation between offensive and defensive positions use similar coaching positions . For example : Phil Housley served as a defensive coordinator for the National Hockey League 's Nashville Predators from 2013 to 2017 and currently fills the same role with the Arizona Coyotes .",
