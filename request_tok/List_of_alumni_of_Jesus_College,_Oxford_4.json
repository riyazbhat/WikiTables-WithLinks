  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires",
  "/wiki/Rhodes_Scholars": "The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford . It was established in 1902 , making it the first large-scale programme of international scholarship . The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes , to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths . Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell . President of Pakistan Wasim Sajjad ; former prime minister of Malta Dom Mintoff ; former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott , Bob Hawke and Malcolm Turnbull ; and the current deputy prime minister of Canada , Chrystia Freeland are also Rhodes Scholars .

  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister",

In addition to the standard periodization , proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century . The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past , but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that Man is the measure of all things . This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe : the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century , in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto . As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term Renaissance man . The Renaissance began in the 14th century in Florence , Italy . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure , the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici , and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks",

He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War",

  "/wiki/American_History": "The history of the United States , a country in North America , started with the arrival of Native Americans in the United States from before 15,000 B.C . Numerous indigenous cultures formed , and many disappeared before 1500 . The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas . Most colonies were formed after 1600 , and the early records and writings of John Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded . By the 1760s , the thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . After defeating France , the British government imposed a series of taxes , including the Stamp Act of 1765 , rejecting the colonists ' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval . Resistance to these taxes , especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773 , led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government in Massachusetts . Armed conflict began in 1775 . In 1776 in Philadelphia , the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States . Led by General George Washington , it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France . The peace treaty of 1783 gave the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ) to the new nation . The Articles of Confederation established a central government , but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer",
