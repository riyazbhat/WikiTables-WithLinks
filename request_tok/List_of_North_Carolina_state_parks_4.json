  "/wiki/Blueway": "Water trails ( also known as blueways ) are marked routes on navigable waterway such as rivers , lakes , canals and coastlines for recreational use . They allow access to waterways for non-motorized boats and sometimes motorized vessels , innertubes , and other craft . Water trails not only require suitable access points and take-outs for exit but also provide places ashore to camp and picnic , and other facilities for boaters . Water trails may be in public or private waters . In the United States , many water trails are monitored by the National Park Service . Local statutes may apply to landowners who steward water trails and the boaters who use them . Much of the Trans Canada Trail will be a network of water trails open to canoes and other small vessels . Recreational use of water trails is a form of ecotourism sometimes called paddle tourism . Notable water trails and blueways include :",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain": "The Battle of Kings Mountain was a military engagement between Patriot and Loyalist militias in South Carolina during the Southern Campaign of the American Revolutionary War , resulting in a decisive victory for the Patriots .

The battle has been described as the wars largest all-American fight . Ferguson had arrived in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis ' main force . Ferguson issued a challenge to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences . In response , the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland , James Johnston , William Campbell , John Sevier , Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson . Receiving intelligence on the oncoming attack , Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Lord Cornwallis ' army . However , the Patriots caught up with the Loyalists at Kings Mountain near the border with South Carolina . Achieving a complete surprise , the Patriot militiamen attacked and surrounded the Loyalists , inflicting heavy casualties . After an hour of battle , Ferguson was fatally shot while trying to break the rebel line , after which his men surrendered . Some Patriots gave no quarter until the rebel officers re-established control over their men ; they were said to be seeking revenge for alleged killings by Banastre Tarleton 's militiamen at the Battle of Waxhaws , under the slogan Remember Tarleton 's Quarter .

After the permanent closing of the Badin Works in 2007 , Alcoa continued to operate its Yadkin hydroelectric facilities until selling them to Cube Hydro Carolinas in 2016 . At the time of construction , High Rock was the largest reservoir in North Carolina and one of the largest in the United States . When full , its surface covers 15,180 acres ( 61 km2 ) with 360 miles ( 579 km ) of shoreline and is 59 feet ( 18 m ) deep at the dam .

Upstream , the Yadkin River drains 4341 square miles ( 10,290 km2 ) of the land area of North Carolinas northwest piedmont . The dam was built in a small gorge formed where the river cuts through a major ridge of the Uwharrie Mountains . High Rock Mountain , the highest point in the Uwharries , towers over the adjoining dam site creating one of the most picturesque views found in the North Carolina piedmont . Both the mountain and the lake are named for the high rocks , a large outcropping of rocks located on the ridge approximately half a mile east of the dam . Being its furthest upstream resource , High Rock was managed by Alcoa during most of its years of ownership not only for its electricity production , but also to control water levels in all the Uwharrie Lakes downstream . This often resulted in extreme drawdown during summer months when normal river flow was low .",
  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",
  "/wiki/Reservoir": "A reservoir ( from French r\u00e9servoir - a tank ) is , most commonly , an enlarged natural or artificial lake , pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water . Reservoirs can be created in a number of ways , including controlling a watercourse that drains an existing body of water , interrupting a watercourse to form an embayment within it , through excavation , or building any number of retaining walls or levees . Defined as a storage space for fluids , reservoirs may hold water or gasses , including hydrocarbons . Tank reservoirs store these in ground-level , elevated , or buried tanks . Tank reservoirs for water are also called cisterns . Most underground reservoirs are used to store liquids , principally either water or petroleum , below ground ."
