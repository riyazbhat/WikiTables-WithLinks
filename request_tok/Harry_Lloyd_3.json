  "/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors": "The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare 's early plays . It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies , with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity , in addition to puns and word play . The Comedy of Errors is , along with The Tempest , one of only two Shakespearean plays to observe the Aristotelian principle of unity of time - that is , that the events of a play should occur over 24 hours . It has been adapted for opera , stage , screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide . In the centuries following its premiere , the play 's title has entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout . Set in the Greek city of Ephesus , The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated at birth . Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant , Dromio of Syracuse , arrive in Ephesus , which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers , Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant , Dromio of Ephesus .

It was first staged on September 29 , 1955 , as a one-act verse drama with A Memory of Two Mondays at the Coronet Theatre on Broadway . The run was unsuccessful , and Miller subsequently revised the play to contain two acts ; this version is the one with which audiences are most familiar . The two-act version premiered in the New Watergate theatre club in London 's West End under the direction of Peter Brook on October 11 , 1956 . The play is set in 1950s America , in an Italian-American neighborhood near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York . It employs a chorus and narrator in the character of Alfieri . Eddie , the tragic protagonist , has an improper love of , and almost obsession with , Catherine , his wife Beatrice 's orphaned niece , so he does not approve of her courtship of Beatrice 's cousin Rodolfo . Miller 's interest in writing about the world of the New York docks originated with an unproduced screenplay that he developed with Elia Kazan in the early 1950s ( titled The Hook ) that addressed corruption on the Brooklyn docks . Kazan later directed On the Waterfront , which dealt with the same subject . Miller said that he heard the basic account that developed into the plot of A View from the Bridge from a lawyer who worked with longshoremen , who related it to him as a true story",

  "/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi": "The Duchess of Malfi ( originally published as The Tragedy of the Dutchesse of Malfy ) is a Jacobean revenge tragedy written by English dramatist John Webster in 1612-1613 . It was first performed privately at the Blackfriars Theatre , then later to a larger audience at The Globe , in 1613-1614 . Published in 1623 , the play is loosely based on events that occurred between 1508 and 1513 surrounding Giovanna d'Aragona , Duchess of Amalfi ( d. 1511 ) , whose father , Enrico d'Aragona , Marquis of Gerace , was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand I of Naples . As in the play , she secretly married Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna after the death of her first husband Alfonso I Piccolomini , Duke of Amalfi . The play begins as a love story , when the Duchess marries beneath her class , and ends as a nightmarish tragedy as her two brothers undertake their revenge , destroying themselves in the process . Jacobean drama continued the trend of stage violence and horror set by Elizabethan tragedy , under the influence of Seneca . The complexity of some of the play 's characters , particularly Bosola and the Duchess , and Webster 's poetic language , have led many critics to consider The Duchess of Malfi among the greatest tragedies of English renaissance drama .
