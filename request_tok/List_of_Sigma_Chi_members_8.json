In 1964 , Goldwater mobilized a large conservative constituency to win the hard-fought Republican presidential primaries . Although raised as an Episcopalian , Goldwater was the first candidate of ethnically Jewish heritage to be nominated for President by a major American party ( his father was Jewish ) . Goldwater 's platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson . Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969 and specialized in defense and foreign policy . As an elder statesman of the party , Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974 when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent .
