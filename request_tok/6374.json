  "/wiki/Frank_Borman": "Frank Frederick Borman II ( born March 14 , 1928 ) is a retired United States Air Force ( USAF ) colonel , aeronautical engineer , test pilot , businessman , rancher , and NASA astronaut . He was the commander of Apollo 8 , the first mission to fly around the Moon , and together with crewmates Jim Lovell and Bill Anders , became the first of 24 humans to do so , for which he was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor . As of 2020 [ update ] , he is the oldest living former American astronaut , eleven days older than Lovell . Four days before he graduated with the West Point class of 1950 , in which he was ranked eighth out of 670 , Borman was commissioned in the USAF . He qualified as a fighter pilot and served in the Philippines . He earned a Master of Science degree at the California Institute of Technology in 1957 , and then became an assistant professor of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics at West Point . In 1960 , he was selected for Class 60-C at the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California and qualified as a test pilot . On graduation , he was accepted as one of five students in the first class at the Aerospace Research Pilot School . Borman was selected as a NASA astronaut with the second group , known as the Next Nine , in 1962 . In 1966 , he set a fourteen-day spaceflight endurance record as commander of Gemini 7 . He served on the NASA review board which investigated the Apollo 1 fire , and then flew to the Moon with Apollo 8 in December 1968 . The mission is known for the Earthrise photograph taken by Anders of the Earth rising above the lunar horizon as the Command/Service Module orbited the Moon , and for the reading from Genesis , which was televised to Earth from lunar orbit on Christmas Eve .",
  "/wiki/Gemini_7": "Gemini 7 ( officially Gemini VII ) was a 1965 crewed spaceflight in NASA 's Gemini program . It was the fourth crewed Gemini flight , the twelfth crewed American flight and the twentieth crewed spaceflight including Soviet flights and X-15 flights above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line . The crew of Frank Borman and Jim Lovell spent nearly 14 days in space , making a total of 206 orbits . Their spacecraft was the passive target for the first crewed space rendezvous performed by the crew of Gemini 6A .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_8": "Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first to reach the Moon , orbit it , and return . Its three-astronaut crew - Frank Borman , James Lovell , and William Anders - were the first humans to fly to the Moon , to witness and photograph an Earthrise , and to escape the gravity of a celestial body . Apollo 8 launched on December 21 , 1968 , and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the United States Apollo space program after Apollo 7 , which stayed in Earth orbit . Apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center , located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . Originally planned as the second crewed Apollo Lunar Module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight . Astronaut Jim McDivitt 's crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit , became the crew for the Apollo 9 mission , and Borman 's crew were moved to the Apollo 8 mission . This left Borman 's crew with two to three months ' less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training . Apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the Moon . The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours , during which they made a Christmas Eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis . At the time , the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever . Apollo 8 's successful mission paved the way for Apollo 11 to fulfill U.S. president John F. Kennedy 's goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s . The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27 , 1968 , when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean .",
  "/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon": "The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth . The far side 's terrain is rugged with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria compared to the near side . It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System , the South Pole-Aitken basin . Both sides of the Moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night ; even so , the far side is sometimes called the dark side of the Moon , where dark is used to mean unseen rather than lacking sunlight . About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to libration . The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959 , when it was photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe . The Soviet Academy of Sciences published the first atlas of the far side in 1960 . The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first humans to see the far side with the naked eye when they orbited the Moon in 1968 . All manned and unmanned soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon , until 3 January 2019 when the Chang ' e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side . Astronomers have suggested installing a large radio telescope on the far side , where the Moon would shield it from possible radio interference from Earth .",

Aldrin made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission , and as the lunar module pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission , he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the Moon . Born in Glen Ridge , New Jersey , Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point , with a degree in mechanical engineering . He was commissioned into the United States Air Force , and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War . He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft . After earning a Sc.D . degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA 's Astronaut Group 3 , making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree . His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous , earning him the nickname Dr. Rendezvous from fellow astronauts . His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity . Three years later , Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21 , 1969 ( UTC ) , nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface , while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit . A Presbyterian elder , Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion . Upon leaving NASA in 1971 , Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School .",

It was the 10th and final crewed Gemini flight , the 18th crewed American spaceflight , and the 26th spaceflight of all time , including X-15 flights over 100 kilometers ( 54 nmi ) . Commanded by Gemini VII veteran James A. Lovell , the flight featured three periods of extravehicular activity ( EVA ) by rookie Edwin Buzz Aldrin , lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes . It also achieved the fifth rendezvous and fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle . Gemini XII marked a successful conclusion of the Gemini program , achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft . This was instrumental in paving the way for the Apollo program to achieve its goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_11": "Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon . Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:17 UTC . Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth .",
  "/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)": "Michael Collins ( born October 31 , 1930 ) is an American former astronaut who flew the Apollo 11 command module Columbia around the Moon while his crewmates , Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , made the first crewed landing on the surface . He was a test pilot and major general in the US Air Force Reserves . Selected as part of NASA 's third group of fourteen astronauts in 1963 , Collins flew in space twice . His first spaceflight was on Gemini 10 in 1966 , in which he and Command Pilot John Young performed orbital rendezvous with two different spacecraft and undertook two extravehicular activities ( EVAs , also known as spacewalks ) . On the 1969 Apollo 11 mission he became one of 24 people to fly to the Moon , which he orbited thirty times . He was the fourth person ( and third American ) to perform a spacewalk , the first person to have performed more than one spacewalk , and , after Young , who flew the command module on Apollo 10 , the second person to orbit the Moon alone . Prior to becoming an astronaut , Collins graduated from the United States Military Academy with the class of 1952 . He joined the United States Air Force , and flew F-86 Sabre fighters at Chambley-Bussi\u00e8res Air Base , France . He was accepted into the U.S. Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in 1960 . After retiring from NASA in 1970 , Collins took a job in the Department of State as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs . A year later , he became the director of the National Air and Space Museum , and held this position until 1978 , when he stepped down to become undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution .

It was the tenth crewed American spaceflight ( including two X-15 flights at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers ( 54 nmi ) ) . Astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White circled the Earth 66 times in four days , making it the first US flight to approach the five-day flight of the Soviet Vostok 5 . The highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an American , during which White floated free outside the spacecraft , tethered to it , for approximately 20 minutes . Both of these accomplishments helped the United States overcome the Soviet Union 's early lead in the Space Race . The flight also included the first attempt to make a space rendezvous as McDivitt attempted to maneuver his craft close to the Titan II upper stage which launched it into orbit , but this was not successful . The flight was the first American flight to perform many scientific experiments in space , including use of a sextant to investigate the use of celestial navigation for lunar flight in the Apollo program .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_1": "Apollo 1 , initially designated AS-204 , was the first crewed mission of the United States Apollo program , the undertaking to land the first men on the Moon . Planned as the first low Earth orbital test of the Apollo command and service module , to launch on February 21 , 1967 , the mission never flew ; a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34 on January 27 killed all three crew members - Command Pilot Virgil I. Gus Grissom , Senior Pilot Ed White , and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee - and destroyed the command module ( CM ) . The name Apollo 1 , chosen by the crew , was made official by NASA in their honor after the fire . Immediately after the fire , NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to determine the cause of the fire , and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA 's investigation . The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical , and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material , and the high pressure , pure oxygen cabin atmosphere . Rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch , which could not be opened against the internal pressure of the cabin . Because the rocket was unfueled , the test had not been considered hazardous , and emergency preparedness for it was poor . During the Congressional investigation , Senator Walter Mondale publicly revealed a NASA internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor North American Aviation , which became known as the Phillips Report . This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator James E. Webb , who was unaware of the document 's existence , and attracted controversy to the Apollo program . Despite congressional displeasure at NASA 's lack of openness , both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident . Manned Apollo flights were suspended for 20 months while the command module 's hazards were addressed . However , the development and uncrewed testing of the lunar module ( LM ) and Saturn V rocket continued .",
  "/wiki/Spacewalk": "Extravehicular activity ( EVA ) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth 's appreciable atmosphere . The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth ( such as the International Space Station ) . On March 18 , 1965 , Alexei Leonov became the first human to perform a spacewalk , exiting the capsule during the Voskhod 2 mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds . The term also applied to lunar surface exploration ( commonly known as moonwalks ) performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the Apollo program from 1969 to 1972 . On July 21 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong became the first human to perform a moonwalk , outside his lunar lander on Apollo 11 for 2 hours and 31 minutes . On the last three Moon missions astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth , to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft . Astronauts Pete Conrad , Joseph Kerwin , and Paul Weitz also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab , the United States ' first space station . A Stand-up EVA ( SEVA ) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft , but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support . Its name derives from the astronaut standing up in the open hatch , usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut . EVAs may be either tethered ( the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft ; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable ; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft ) , or untethered . Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit ( MMU ) , and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue ( SAFER ) , a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs . The Soviet Union/Russia , the United States , and China have conducted EVAs .",

The mission was flown to qualify the LM for lunar orbit operations in preparation for the first Moon landing by demonstrating its descent and ascent propulsion systems , showing that its crew could fly it independently , then rendezvous and dock with the CSM again , as would be required for the first crewed lunar landing . Other objectives of the flight included firing the LM descent engine to propel the spacecraft stack as a backup mode ( as would be required on the Apollo 13 mission ) , and use of the Portable Life Support System backpack outside of the LM cabin . The three-person crew consisted of Commander James McDivitt , Command Module Pilot David Scott , and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart . During the ten-day mission , they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon , including the LM engines , backpack life support systems , navigation systems and docking maneuvers . After launching on March 3 , 1969 , the crew performed the first crewed flight of a lunar module , the first docking and extraction of the same , one two-person spacewalk ( EVA ) , and the second docking of two crewed spacecraft - two months after the Soviets performed a spacewalk crew transfer between Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 .
