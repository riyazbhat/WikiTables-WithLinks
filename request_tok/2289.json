Before Islam influence started in the 8th century AD , Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures in its early history . After its destruction by Genghis Khan in 1219 , the city was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road . From 18th to 19th century , the city became an independent city-state , before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand . In 1865 , it fell to the Russian Empire , and became the capital of Russian Turkestan . In Soviet times , Tashkent witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union . Much of the city was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake , though it was rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city . It was the fourth-largest city of the Soviet Union at the time , after Moscow , Leningrad and Kiev . Today , as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan , Tashkent retains a multi-ethnic population , with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority . In 2009 , the city celebrated its 2,200 years of written history .",
