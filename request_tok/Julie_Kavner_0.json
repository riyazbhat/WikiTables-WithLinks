They are currently seen in rotation among the four major networks ( ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC ) . The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC ( such as in 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 ) , so that it does not conflict with NBC 's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games ( due to another conflict , this time with the MTV Video Music Awards , the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday ) . However , the 2018 ceremony , broadcast by NBC , was moved back to September and aired on a Monday .

They conceived numerous plot ideas , with Groening 's being the one developed into a film .
