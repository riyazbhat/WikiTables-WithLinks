  "/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)": "A halfback ( HB ) is an offensive position in American football , whose duties involve lining up in the backfield and carrying the ball on most rushing plays , i.e . a running back . When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield , and especially when that player is placed behind another player ( usually a blocking back ) , as in the I formation , that player is instead referred to as a tailback ( see History below ) . The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field , and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team 's success . Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",

Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .
