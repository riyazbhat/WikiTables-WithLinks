  "/wiki/Greater_Manchester": "Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in North West England , with a population of 2.8 million ; the third largest in England after Greater London and the West Midlands . It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",
  "/wiki/Samuel_Brooks_(railway_pioneer)": "Samuel Brooks ( 12 August 1793 - 7 June 1864 ) was an English cotton manufacturer and banker . He was born at Great Harwood , near Whalley in Lancashire , England , the second son of William Brooks . In 1815 he became a partner in his fathers Blackburn-based business , Cunliffe Brooks & Co . This business supplied cotton and/or textile equipment , and also ran a bank as a sideline . Around 1819 his father set up Samuel and his two brothers as junior partners in three separate firms of calico printers in Manchester . Samuel opened a small branch of his fathers bank in a corner of his warehouse . Gradually , banking became his principal activity , and in 1826 the bank moved to its own premises . It soon became established as one of Manchesters leading banks . In 1900 it was absorbed by Lloyd 's Bank to provide them with a presence in the Manchester area . Subsequently Brooks established the first housing estates in Whalley Range ( which he named ) and Brooklands ( which acquired its name from common usage ) . William Cunliffe Brooks was the son of Samuel Brooks and his wife Margaret , n\u00e9e Hall , daughter of Thomas Hall .",

Chester is the second-largest settlement in Cheshire after Warrington . Chester was founded as a castrum or Roman fort with the name Deva Victrix in the reign of the Emperor Vespasian in 79 AD . One of the main army camps in Roman Britain , Deva later became a major civilian settlement . In 689 , King \u00c6thelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia , which later became Chester 's first cathedral , and the Saxons extended and strengthened the walls to protect the city against the Danes . Chester was one of the last cities in England to fall to the Normans . William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a castle , to dominate the town and the nearby Welsh border . Chester was granted city status in 1541 . Chester is one of the best-preserved walled cities in Britain . It has a number of medieval buildings , but many of the black-and-white buildings within the city centre are Victorian restorations , originating from the Black-and-white Revival movement . Apart from a 100-metre ( 330 ft ) section , the Grade I listed walls are almost complete .",

  "/wiki/Heritage_centre": "A heritage centre , center , or museum is a public facility - typically a museum , monument , visitor centre , or park - that is primarily dedicated to the presentation of historical and cultural information about a place and its people , and often also including , to some degree , the area 's natural history . Heritage centres typically differ from most traditional museums in featuring a high proportion of hands-on exhibits and live or lifelike specimens and practical artifacts . Some are open-air museums - heritage parks - devoted to depiction of daily life or occupational activity at a particular time and place , and may feature re-creations of typical buildings of an era . Such sites are often used for experimental archaeology , and as shooting locations for documentaries and historical-fiction films and television . A few are rebuilt archaeological sites , using the excavated foundations of original buildings , some restore historic structures that were not yet lost , while others are mock-ups built near actual sites of historic value ( which may still be subject to ongoing excavation , study , and preservation ) . Many also have living museum features , such as costumed staff , demonstrations of and short courses in historical craft-working , dramatic presentations ( live-action mock combat , etc . ) , and other living history activities . Others may be more narrowly focused on a particular occupation or industry , such as rail transport or the early factories or mines around which a community developed . The distinction between a heritage centre or park , and a history-based theme park can become blurred , as at Nikko Edomura , focused on Feudal Japan , and Wild West City , a self-described heritage theme park about the American Old West .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",
  "/wiki/Scheduled_monument": "In the United Kingdom , a scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building , given protection against unauthorised change . The various pieces of legislation used for legally protecting heritage assets from damage and destruction are grouped under the term designation .

A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic , archaeological , architectural or artistic interest . Only some of these are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation . There are about 20,000 scheduled monuments in England representing about 37,000 heritage assets . Of the tens of thousands of scheduled monuments in the UK , most are inconspicuous archaeological sites , but some are large ruins .

  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80 % of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",

  "/wiki/John_Douglas_(architect)": "John Douglas ( 11 April 1830 - 23 May 1911 ) was an English architect who designed over 500 buildings in Cheshire , North Wales , and northwest England , in particular in the estate of Eaton Hall . He was trained in Lancaster and practised throughout his career from an office in Chester . Initially he ran the practice on his own , but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants . Douglas 's output included new churches , restoring and renovating existing churches , church furnishings , new houses and alterations to existing houses , and a variety of other buildings , including shops , banks , offices , schools , memorials and public buildings . His architectural styles were eclectic . Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival , and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style . He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French , German and Dutch architecture . However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings , in particular half-timbering , influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester . Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging , pargeting , and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks . Of particular importance is Douglas 's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving . Throughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists , especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall .

  "/wiki/Presbyterianism": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Black-and-white_Revival_architecture": "The Black-and-white Revival was an architectural movement from the middle of the 19th century which re-used the vernacular elements of the past , using timber framing . The wooden framing is painted black and the panels between the frames are painted white . The style was part of a wider Tudor Revival in 19th-century architecture . Nikolaus Pevsner describes the movement as a Cheshire speciality , but states that it was not created in Cheshire and is not confined to the county . The earliest example noted by Pevsner is the Henry VII Lodge in Woburn Sands , Bedfordshire , built in 1811 . The other example he gives is the Court House in Worsley , which was built in 1849 . The first Cheshire architect to be involved in the movement was T. M. Penson who restored the house at No . 22 Eastgate Street , Chester in 1852 in the black-and-white style . This was followed by his further restorations in Eastgate Street , at Nos . 34-36 in 1856 , and No . 26 in 1858 . However , Pevsner considers that Penson 's works were moderate in size and not very knowledgeable in detail .",
