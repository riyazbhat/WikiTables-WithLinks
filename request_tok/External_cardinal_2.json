Among these men were important figures in the history of Germany such as Hatto I , Siegfried III , Peter of Aspelt , and Albert of Mainz . There were several violent contests between rivals for the archbishopric , and their power struggles occasionally moved the citizens of Mainz to revolt . The lands of the elector lay around the city of Mainz on both banks of the Rhine ; their area reached 3200 sq . m by the end of the Empire .

  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury": "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England , the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury . The current archbishop is Justin Welby , who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013 . Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission ."
