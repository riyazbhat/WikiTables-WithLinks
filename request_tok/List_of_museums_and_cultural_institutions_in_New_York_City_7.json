A republican , he contributed to the Italian unification and the creation of the Kingdom of Italy . He is considered one of the greatest generals of modern times and one of Italy 's fathers of the fatherland along with Camillo Benso , Count of Cavour , Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and Giuseppe Mazzini . Garibaldi is also known as the Hero of the Two Worlds because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe . Garibaldi was a follower of the Italian nationalist , Giuseppe Mazzini , and embraced republican nationalism as exemplified by the Young Italy movement . He became a life-long supporter of Italian unification under a democratic Republican government . After participating in an uprising in Piedmont , he was sentenced to death and he escaped by sailing to South America ; he spent fourteen years in exile , taking part in several wars and learning the art of guerrilla warfare . In 1835 , in Brazil , he took up the cause of the Riograndense Republic in its attempt to proclaim another republic within Santa Catarina , joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins . Garibaldi also became involved in the Uruguayan Civil War , raising an Italian force known as Redshirts , and is today celebrated as an important contributor towards the independence of the country . In 1848 , he returned to Italy and commanded and fought in many military campaigns that eventually led to the Italian unification . The provisional government of Milan made Garibaldi a general , and in 1849 , the Minister of War promoted him to General of the Roman Republic . When the war of independence broke out in April 1859 , he led his Hunters of the Alps in the capture of Varese and Como and reached the frontier of South Tyrol ; the war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy .",

Meucci is best known for developing a voice-communication apparatus that several sources credit as the first telephone . Meucci set up a form of voice-communication link in his Staten Island , New York , home that connected the second-floor bedroom to his laboratory . He submitted a patent caveat for his telephonic device to the U.S. Patent Office in 1871 , but there was no mention of electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound in his caveat . In 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound by undulatory electric current . Despite the longstanding general crediting of Bell with the accomplishment , the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities supported celebrations of Meucci 's 200th birthday in 2008 using the title Inventore del telefono ( Inventor of the telephone ) . The U.S. House of Representatives also honored Meucci in a resolution in 2002 for having had some role in the development of the telephone , although the U.S. Senate did not join the resolution and the interpretation of the resolution is disputed .",

Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan . Manhattan has been described as the cultural , financial , media , and entertainment capital of the world , and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and Manhattan is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization : the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan , and the borough has been the setting for numerous books , films , and television shows . Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world , with the value of Manhattan Island , including real estate , estimated to exceed US $ 3 trillion in 2013 ; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US $ 1,600 per square foot ( $ 17,000/m2 ) as of 2018 , with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world , at US $ 3,000 per square foot ( $ 32,000/m2 ) per year in 2017 . Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders , which equals roughly $ 1059 in current terms . The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother , the Duke of York .",
  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",
