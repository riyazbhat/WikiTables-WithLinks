Archaeological excavations carried out by A. Bernshtam corroborated that records . Kerben gained notoriety in 2002 when police fired into a crowd of unarmed demonstrators , killing six . The demonstrations were triggered by a political dispute between a local member of the national parliament , Azimbek Beknazarov , and Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev over an agreement with China that ceded some territory in the high Tien Shan range to China . Local officials and police officers suspected of being involved in the shootings were later acquitted or pardoned . Beknazarov remained an implacable political enemy of Akayev . In the wake of the March 2005 Tulip Revolution which sent Akayev into exile in Russia , he was appointed Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyz Republic and waged a determined campaign against Akayev and his family , seeking the return of much of the fortune amassed by the former president 's family and a repeal of Akayev 's immunity for life . He resigned his position in September 2005 under a cloud of suspicion concerning alleged secret deals of money for premature closure of investigations into other misdeeds .
