Historically part of Lanarkshire , the city now forms the Glasgow City council area , one of the 32 council areas of Scotland ; the local authority is Glasgow City Council . Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938",

Bath is in the valley of the River Avon , 97 miles ( 156 km ) west of London and 11 miles ( 18 km ) southeast of Bristol . The city became a World Heritage site in 1987 . The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis ( the waters of Sul ) c. 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon , although hot springs were known even before then . Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre ; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries . In the 17th century , claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs , and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era . Georgian architecture , crafted from Bath stone , includes the Royal Crescent , Circus , Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city 's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761 . Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood , the Elder , and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew .

  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed",
  "/wiki/Clemency": "A pardon is a government decision to allow a person to be relieved of some or all of the legal consequences resulting from a criminal conviction . A pardon may be granted before or after conviction for the crime , depending on the laws of the jurisdiction . Pardons can be granted in many countries when individuals are deemed to have demonstrated that they have paid their debt to society , or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them . Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted . In some jurisdictions of some nations , accepting a pardon may implicitly constitute an admission of guilt ; the offer is refused in some cases . Cases of wrongful conviction are in recent times more often dealt with by appeal rather than by pardon ; however , a pardon is sometimes offered when innocence is undisputed in order to avoid the costs that are associated with a retrial . Clemency plays a critical role when capital punishment is applied . Pardons are sometimes seen as a mechanism for combating corruption , allowing a particular authority to circumvent a flawed judicial process to free someone that is seen as wrongly convicted . Pardons can also be a source of controversy . In extreme cases , some pardons may be seen as acts of corruption by officials in the form of granting effective immunity as political favors",
  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment": "Life imprisonment ( also known as imprisonment for life , life in prison , whole-life order , a life sentence , a life term , lifelong incarceration , life incarceration or simply life ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled or otherwise commuted to a fixed term . Crimes for which , in some countries , a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , apostasy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , child rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , aircraft hijacking , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law . Life imprisonment ( as a maximum term ) can also be imposed , in certain countries , for traffic offenses causing death . The life sentence does not exist in all countries : Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment , in 1884 . Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary . Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted . In some countries , including Sweden , parole does not exist but a life sentence may - after a successful application - be commuted to a fixed-term sentence , after which the culprit is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed . In many countries around the world , particularly in the Commonwealth , courts have the authority to pass prison terms which may amount to de facto life imprisonment",

The only surviving member of June and Nevill 's immediate family was their adopted son , Jeremy Bamber , then 24 years old , who said he had been at home a few miles away when the shooting took place . The police at first believed that Sheila , diagnosed with schizophrenia , had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself . But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber 's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself . The prosecution argued that , motivated by a large inheritance , Bamber had shot the family with his father 's semi-automatic rifle , then placed the gun in his unstable sister 's hands to make it look like a murder-suicide . A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long , they argued , for Sheila 's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself . Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10-2 majority , sentenced to a minimum of 25 years , and informed in 1994 that he would never be released . The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002 . Bamber protested his innocence throughout , although his extended family remained convinced of his guilt . Between 2004 and 2012 , his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission . They argued that the silencer might not have been used during the killings , that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed , that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders , and that the time of Sheila 's death had been miscalculated",

Parts of it may be regarded as lying within Central London ( though that term too has no precise definition ) . The term East of Aldgate Pump is sometimes used as a synonym for the area . The East End began to emerge in the Middle Ages with initially slow urban growth outside the eastern walls , which later accelerated , especially in the 19th century , to absorb pre-existing settlements . The first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity , as opposed its component parts , comes from John Strype 's 1720 Survey of London , which describes London as consisting of four parts : the City of London , Westminster , Southwark , and That Part beyond the Tower . The relevance of Strype 's reference to the Tower was more than geographical . The East End was the urbanised part of an administrative area called the Tower Division , which had owed military service to the Tower of London since time immemorial . Later , as London grew further , the fully urbanised Tower Division became a byword for wider East London , before East London grew further still , east of the River Lea and into Essex . The area was notorious for its deep poverty , overcrowding and associated social problems . This led to the East End 's history of intense political activism and association with some of the country 's most influential social reformers .

Those aged under 18 are sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for murder , or detention for life for other crimes where life imprisonment is the sentence for adults ; however , regardless of age all defendants including those under 18 sentenced to a life sentence can theoretically be held in custody for their whole life if required and a life sentence can only end if quashed by a judge or the person serving the sentence dies . In addition to the sentences mentioned above , until 2012 there were two other kinds of life sentence , imprisonment for public protection ( for those over 18 ) and detention for public protection ( for those under 18 ) . These were for defendants whose crimes were not serious enough to merit a normal life sentence , but who were considered a danger to the public and so should not be released until the Parole Board had decided that they no longer represented a risk . These sentences were abolished by the Legal Aid , Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 , although a number of prisoners remain imprisoned under the former legislation",
  "/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid": "gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid or \u03b3-Hydroxybutyric acid ( GHB ) , also known as 4-hydroxybutanoic acid , is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug . It is a precursor to GABA , glutamate , and glycine in certain brain areas . It acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor . GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy , narcolepsy , and alcoholism . It is also used illegally as an intoxicant , as an athletic performance enhancer , as a date rape drug , and as a recreational drug . It is commonly used in the form of a salt , such as sodium \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate ( Na.GHB , sodium oxybate , or Xyrem ) or potassium \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate ( K.GHB , potassium oxybate ) . GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation , and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines , beef and small citrus fruits . Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood"
