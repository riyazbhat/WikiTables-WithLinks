The station was inaugurated in 1988 with the extension of the Eastern branch of line 1B from Alma to Stockel/Stokkel . Due to its location in a park-and-ride lot , it is one of the few Brussels Metro stations that has its own station building on the surface ( most other stations having only an underground mezzanine ) . Originally , the station was just called Kraainem , using only Dutch spelling , as it was technically named after the Kraainemlaan ( fr : Avenue de Kraainem ) ( a road using Dutch spelling for both its Dutch and French names ) , not after the nearby municipality ( Dutch : gemeente , French : commune ) of Kraainem . However , French speakers in the Brussels community quickly protested against what they regarded as a violation of bilingual language facilities and insisted that the French form Crainhem be added to the name of the station . Thus the station is today usually held to be named after the municipality of Kraainem , even though it is not actually located on its territory , but partly under the UCLouvain Bruxelles Woluwe university campus ."
