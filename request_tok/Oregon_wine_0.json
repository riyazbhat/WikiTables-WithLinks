  "/wiki/The_Eyrie_Vineyards": "The Eyrie Vineyards is an American winery in Oregon that consists of 60 acres ( 24 ha ) in five different vineyards in the Dundee Hills AVA of the Willamette Valley . The vineyards and winery were established by owner and winemaker David Lett , who produced the first Pinot gris in the United States . Against the advice of viticultural professors at the University of California , Davis , Lett and his wife , Diana , moved to Oregon to plant Pinot noir . They founded Eyrie Vineyards in 1965 , and their first vintage was 1970 . The 1975 Eyrie Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir won tenth place among Pinot noirs in blind tasting at the Wine Olympics in 1979 . Burgundy winemaker Robert Drouhin organized a re-match at Maison Joseph Drouhin in France . The 1975 Eyrie Vineyards Reserve won second place , losing to Drouhin 's 1959 Chambolle-Musigny by only two tenths of a point . Drouhin later purchased land in Oregon and built Domaine Drouhin Oregon . Over the years , David Lett ( known locally as Papa Pinot ) maintained a light-handed style of Pinot noir that did not follow the trend toward greater flavor , tannin , and color extraction , believing color not to be an indicator of quality in Pinot noir . This put him at odds with some of the wine critics . David Lett died on October 9 , 2008 from heart failure . David 's son Jason Lett is now the head winemaker for the winery .",
