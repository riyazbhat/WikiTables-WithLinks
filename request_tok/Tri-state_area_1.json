  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago .

The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States .

It is nominally a circle with a supposed - yet in fact only approximate and variable - 12-mile ( 19 km ) radius , centered in the town of New Castle , Delaware . In 1750 , the center of the circle was fixed at the cupola of the courthouse in New Castle . The Twelve-Mile Circle continues into the Delaware River . A small portion of the circle , known as the Arc Line , also forms part of the Mason-Dixon line , separating Delaware and Maryland . Two other small portions , although not actually demarcated until 1934 , form parts of the boundary between the states of Delaware and New Jersey . Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the United States that is a true arc , many cities in the South ( such as Plains , Georgia ) also have circular boundaries . Its existence dates back to 1681 , when Charles II granted a deed to William Penn north of the already chartered Maryland . Charles created an exception , consisting of 12 miles around the town of New Castle and extending down the peninsula , as these lands were held by the Duke of York , who had won them in conquest from the Dutch colonists .

The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river .

Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas"
