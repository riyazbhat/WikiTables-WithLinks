  "/wiki/B-58_Hustler": "The Convair B-58 Hustler was a high speed bomber designed and produced by American aircraft manufacturer Convair . It was the first operational bomber capable of Mach 2 flight . The B-58 was developed during the 1950s for the United States Air Force 's ( USAF ) Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . To achieve the high speeds desired , Convair designed it around a large delta wing , which was also used by contemporary fighters such as the Convair F-102 . It was powered by four General Electric J79 engines in underwing pods . It had no bomb bay ; it carried a single nuclear weapon plus fuel in a combination bomb/fuel pod underneath the fuselage . Later , four external hardpoints were added , enabling it to carry up to five weapons . The B-58 was introduced to service in March 1960 , and was operated by two bomb wings ( the 43d Bombardment Wing and the 305th Bombardment Wing ) of the SAC throughout the 1960s . It was considered to be a difficult aircraft to fly , imposing a high workload upon its three-man crews . Replacing the Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber , the B-58 was originally intended to fly at high altitudes and supersonic speeds to avoid Soviet interceptors . The B-58 became notorious for its sonic boom , which was often heard on the ground by the public as it passed overhead in supersonic flight . Following the introduction of highly accurate Soviet surface-to-air missiles , the B-58 was forced to adopt a low-level-penetration role that severely limited its range and strategic value",
  "/wiki/XB-70_Valkyrie": "The North American Aviation XB-70 Valkyrie was the prototype version of the planned B-70 nuclear-armed , deep-penetration strategic bomber for the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command . Designed in the late 1950s by North American Aviation ( NAA ) , the six-engined Valkyrie was capable of cruising for thousands of miles at Mach 3+ while flying at 70,000 feet ( 21,000 m ) . At these speeds , it was expected that the B-70 would be practically immune to interceptor aircraft , the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time . The bomber would spend only a brief time over a particular radar station , flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception . High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude and high-speed capacity could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet interceptor or fighter aircraft . The introduction of the first Soviet surface-to-air missiles in the late 1950s put the near-invulnerability of the B-70 in doubt . In response , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) began flying its missions at low level , where the missile radar 's line of sight was limited by terrain . In this low-level penetration role , the B-70 offered little additional performance over the B-52 it was meant to replace , while being far more expensive with shorter range . Other alternate missions were proposed , but these were of limited scope . With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) during the late 1950s , manned bombers were increasingly seen as obsolete . The USAF eventually gave up fighting for its production and the B-70 program was canceled in 1961 .

Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . The 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing expected supersonic airliners - the development of which was announced in the early 1960s - to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future .

  "/wiki/F-104_Starfighter": "The Lockheed F-104 Starfighter is an American single-engine , supersonic interceptor aircraft which became widely used as a fighter-bomber during the Cold War . Initially a day fighter , it was developed into an all-weather fighter in the late 1960s . It was originally developed by Lockheed for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) , but was later produced by several other nations , seeing widespread service outside the United States . One of the Century Series of fighter aircraft , it was operated by the air forces of more than a dozen nations from 1958 to 2004 . Its design team was led by Kelly Johnson , who contributed to the development of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning , Lockheed U-2 , Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird , and other Lockheed aircraft . The F-104 set numerous world records , including both airspeed and altitude records . Its success was marred by the Lockheed bribery scandals , in which Lockheed had given bribes to a considerable number of political and military figures in various nations to influence their judgment and secure several purchase contracts ; this caused considerable political controversy in Europe and Japan . The poor safety record of the Starfighter also brought the aircraft into the public eye , especially in German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) service . Fighter ace Erich Hartmann was put into early retirement from the Luftwaffe due to his outspoken opposition to the selection of the F-104 . The final production version of the fighter model was the F-104S , an all-weather interceptor designed by Aeritalia for the Italian Air Force , and equipped with radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missiles . An advanced F-104 with a high-mounted wing , known as the CL-1200 Lancer , was considered , but did not proceed past the mock-up stage",

The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries ( see comparative military ranks ) , but is often subdivided into senior ( first lieutenant ) and junior ( second lieutenant and even third lieutenant ) ranks . In navies it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain ; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank . The rank is also used in fire services , emergency medical services , security services and police forces . Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure . It often designates someone who is second-in-command , and as such , may precede the name of the rank directly above it . For example , a lieutenant master is likely to be second-in-command to the master in an organisation using both ranks . Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments , and Quebec lieutenant in Canadian politics .

  "/wiki/P-51_Mustang": "The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang is an American long-range , single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II and the Korean War , among other conflicts . The Mustang was designed in April 1940 by a design team headed by James Kindelberger of North American Aviation ( NAA ) in response to a requirement of the British Purchasing Commission . The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build Curtiss P-40 fighters under license for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . Rather than build an old design from another company , North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter . The prototype NA-73X airframe was rolled out on 9 September 1940 , 102 days after the contract was signed , and first flew on 26 October . The Mustang was designed to use the Allison V-1710 engine , which had limited high-altitude performance in its earlier variants . The aircraft was first flown operationally by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a tactical-reconnaissance aircraft and fighter-bomber ( Mustang Mk I ) . Replacing the Allison with a Rolls-Royce Merlin resulted in the P-51B/C ( Mustang Mk III ) model and transformed the aircraft 's performance at altitudes above 15,000 ft ( 4,600 m ) ( without sacrificing range ) , allowing it to compete with the Luftwaffe 's fighters . The definitive version , the P-51D , was powered by the Packard V-1650-7 , a license-built version of the two-speed two-stage-supercharged Merlin 66 , and was armed with six .50 caliber ( 12.7 mm ) AN/M2 Browning machine guns . From late 1943 , P-51Bs and P-51Cs ( supplemented by P-51Ds from mid-1944 ) were used by the USAAF 's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany , while the RAF 's Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF 's Ninth Air Force used the Merlin-powered Mustangs as fighter-bombers , roles in which the Mustang helped ensure Allied air superiority in 1944 . The P-51 was also used by Allied air forces in the North African , Mediterranean , Italian and Pacific theaters . During World War II , Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft",
  "/wiki/Brigadier_General": "Brigadier general ( Brig . Gen. ) or brigade general is a senior rank in the armed forces . It is the lowest ranking general officer in some countries , usually sitting between the ranks of colonel and major general . When appointed to a field command , a brigadier general is typically in command of a brigade consisting of around 4,000 troops ( four battalions ) . In some countries a brigadier general is informally designated as a one-star general ( OF-6 ) . In some countries , this rank is given the name of brigadier , which is usually equivalent to brigadier general in the armies of nations that use the rank . The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a brigadier general , or simply a brigadier , would command a brigade in the field . The rank name g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade ( which translates as brigade general ) was first used in the French revolutionary armies . In the first quarter of the 20th century , British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment , or as an honorary appointment on retirement ; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier , which was not classed as a general officer . Some armies , such as Taiwan and Japan , use major general as the equivalent of brigadier general ( See also Japan & Taiwan for details. ) . Some of these armies then use the rank of colonel general to make four general-officer ranks . [ citation needed ] Mexico uses the ranks of both General brigadier and General de brigada",

Allied propaganda claimed it had been nicknamed the fork-tailed devil ( German : der Gabelschwanz-Teufel ) by the Luftwaffe and two planes , one pilot by the Japanese . Along with its use as a general fighter , the P-38 was utilized in various aerial combat roles including as a highly effective fighter-bomber , a night fighter , and as a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks . The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder , guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers ; or even other P-38s , equipped with bombs , to their targets . Used in the aerial reconnaissance role , the P-38 would account for 90 percent of the aerial film captured over Europe . The P-38 was used most successfully in the Pacific Theater of Operations and the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations as the aircraft of America 's top aces , Richard Bong ( 40 victories ) , Thomas McGuire ( 38 victories ) and Charles H. MacDonald ( 27 victories ) . In the South West Pacific theater , the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the introduction of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war . Unusual for a fighter of this time , the exhaust was muffled by the turbo-superchargers , making the P-38 's operation relatively quiet . The two turbo-superchargers also provided the P-38 with good high-altitude performance , making it one of the earliest Allied fighters capable of performing at such altitudes . It was extremely forgiving and could be mishandled in many ways , but the rate of roll in the early versions was too low for it to excel as a dogfighter .

  "/wiki/Lifting_body": "A lifting body is a fixed-wing aircraft or spacecraft configuration in which the body itself produces lift . In contrast to a flying wing , which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage , a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing . Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces , lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic , supersonic and hypersonic flight , or spacecraft re-entry . All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight safety . Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 70s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft . The US built a number of lifting body rocket planes to test the concept , as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific . Interest waned as the US Air Force lost interest in the manned mission , and major development ended during the Space Shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage .

  "/wiki/Sound_barrier": "The sound barrier or sonic barrier is the sudden increase in aerodynamic drag and other undesirable effects experienced by an aircraft or other object when it approaches the speed of sound . When aircraft first began to be able to reach close to the speed of sound , these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making faster speeds very difficult or impossible . The term sound barrier is still sometimes used today to refer to aircraft reaching supersonic flight . In dry air at 20 \u00b0C ( 68 \u00b0F ) , the speed of sound is 343 metres per second ( about 767 mph , 1234 km/h or 1,125 ft/s ) . The term came into use during World War II when pilots of high-speed fighter aircraft experienced the effects of compressibility , a number of adverse aerodynamic effects that deterred further acceleration , seemingly impeding flight at speeds close to the speed of sound . These difficulties represented a barrier to flying at faster speeds . In 1947 it was demonstrated that safe flight at the speed of sound was achievable in purpose-designed aircraft thereby breaking the barrier . By the 1950s , new designs of fighter aircraft routinely reached the speed of sound , and faster . [ N 1 ]",

  "/wiki/SR-71_Blackbird": "The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is a long-range , high-altitude , Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft that was operated by the United States Air Force . It was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s by Lockheed and its Skunk Works division . American aerospace engineer Clarence Kelly Johnson was responsible for many of the design 's innovative concepts . During aerial reconnaissance missions , the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats . If a surface-to-air missile launch were detected , the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile . The shape of the SR-71 was based on the A-12 which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section . The SR-71 served with the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1998 . A total of 32 aircraft were built ; 12 were lost in accidents with none lost to enemy action . The SR-71 has been given several nicknames , including Blackbird and Habu . Since 1976 , it has held the world record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft , a record previously held by the related Lockheed YF-12",

  "/wiki/F-82_Twin_Mustang": "The North American F-82 Twin Mustang is the last American piston-engine fighter ordered into production by the United States Air Force . Based on the P-51 Mustang , the F-82 was originally designed as a long-range escort fighter in World War II . The war ended well before the first production units were operational . In the postwar era , Strategic Air Command used the planes as a long-range escort fighter . Radar-equipped F-82s were used extensively by the Air Defense Command as replacements for the Northrop P-61 Black Widow as all-weather day/night interceptors . During the Korean War , Japan-based F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea . The first three North Korean aircraft destroyed by U.S. forces were shot down by F-82s , the first being a North-Korean Yak-11 downed over Gimpo Airfield by the USAF 68th Fighter Squadron"
