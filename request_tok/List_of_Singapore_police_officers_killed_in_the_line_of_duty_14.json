  "/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore": "Capital punishment is a legal penalty in Singapore . The first Prime Minister , Lee Kuan Yew , was a staunch supporter of harsh punishments including execution , but executions peaked under his successor , Goh Chok Tong ; the city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1998 , estimated by the United Nations to be 13.83 executions annually per one million people during that period . The highest was Turkmenistan ( now an abolitionist country ) with 14.92 . Since then , execution has become far less common , with some years having no executions at all . No one was executed in 2012 and 2013 , and two persons were executed in 2014 . Nevertheless , in recent years , executions have started to increase again : in 2018 , 13 people were executed , the most since at least 2003 . Each execution in Singapore is carried out by long drop hanging in Changi Prison at dawn on Friday , except once on 20 May 2016 when the execution of Kho Jabing was carried out at 3:30 pm after his appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed that morning . In a survey done in 2005 , reported in The Straits Times , 95% of Singaporeans believe that their country should retain the death penalty . Singapore has had capital punishment since it was a British colony and became independent before the United Kingdom abolished capital punishment . The Singaporean procedure of hanging condemned individuals is similar to the methods formerly used in the United Kingdom . In 2012 , however , Singapore amended its laws to exempt some cases from the mandatory death sentence .",

  "/wiki/Fast_Response_Car": "Singapore Police Force land division officers typically respond to calls in rapid-deployment vehicles now known as the Fast Response Car ( FRC ) which are the main police cars in Singapore .

Most commonly seen are the Toyota Corolla Altis and the Hyundai Elantra . Around 2000 , Nissan Sunny and Subaru Impreza sedans were added to the fleet . Unlike civilian vehicles in Singapore in which speed limiters ( speed governors ) are installed to prevent over-speeding , Police Fast Response Cars are able to reach their maximum speed potential without hindrance when the need arises . Originally restricted to team leader vehicles during the 1990s , all current FRCs carry a large array of equipment to allow officers to conduct normal policing duties and basic investigative work which officers are expected to perform with the implementation of the Neighbourhood Police Centre ( NPC ) system .
