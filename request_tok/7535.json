  "/wiki/British_S-class_submarine_(1931)": "The S-class submarines of the Royal Navy were originally designed and built during the modernisation of the submarine force in the early 1930s to meet the need for smaller boats to patrol the restricted waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea , replacing the British H-class submarines . As part of the major naval construction for the Royal Navy during the Second World War , the S class became the single largest group of submarines ever built for the Royal Navy . A total of 62 were constructed over a period of 15 years , with fifty of the improved S class being launched between 1940 and 1945 .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Unrivalled_(P45)": "HMS Unrivalled ( P45 ) was a U-class submarine built for the Royal Navy during World War II . The boat has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to ever bear the name Unrivalled . Completed in 1942 , the boat spent most of the war in the Mediterranean . She sank a number of small merchant ships and naval auxiliaries , but major success eluded her during the war . Too small and slow for the post-war environment , Unrivalled was scrapped in 1946 .",

  "/wiki/British_T-class_submarine": "The Royal Navy 's T class ( or Triton class ) of diesel-electric submarines was designed in the 1930s to replace the O , P , and R classes . Fifty-three members of the class were built just before and during the Second World War , where they played a major role in the Royal Navy 's submarine operations . Four boats in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy were known as the Zwaardvisch class . In the decade following the war , the oldest surviving boats were scrapped and the remainder converted to anti-submarine vessels to counter the growing Soviet submarine threat . The Royal Navy disposed of its last operational boat in 1969 , although it retained one permanently moored as a static training submarine until 1974 . The last surviving boat , serving in the Israel Sea Corps , was scrapped in 1977 .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Sturgeon_(73S)": "HMS Sturgeon was an S-class submarine that entered service with the Royal Navy in 1932 . Ordered in 1930 , she was laid down at Chatham Dockyard in January 1931 and launched on 8 January 1932 . Commissioned on 27 February 1933 , Sturgeon was assigned to the 2nd Submarine Flotilla . At the start of World War II , Sturgeon conducted patrols in the North Sea . On 6 September , she was mistakenly bombed by British aircraft . On her second patrol , she fired three torpedoes at an unidentified submarine , which was in fact her sister ship HMS Swordfish , but the torpedoes missed . On her third patrol , she missed the German U-boat U-23 and was damaged after hitting the bottom , requiring repairs . On 20 November , she sank the German armed trawler V-209 with torpedoes . The sinking was the first successful attack by a British submarine of the war , and was a morale boost for British submariners . During her next patrols in the North Sea , Sturgeon sighted and sank several ships , including the German troop transport Pionier and the Danish merchants SS Sigrun and SS Delfinus . Afterwards , Sturgeon patrolled in the Bay of Biscay , acted as a beacon during Operation Torch , then , after being again damaged by Allied aircraft , escorted the Arctic Convoys PQ 15 and PQ 17 . Sturgeon was transferred to the 8th Submarine Flotilla , which operated on the Mediterranean Sea , in October 1942 to support the Allied landings in North Africa .",
