  "/wiki/Letters_patent": "Letters patent ( always in the plural ) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch , president , or other head of state , generally granting an office , right , monopoly , title , or status to a person or corporation . Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices , or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms . Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown , such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms , as well as appointing a Royal Commission . In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm . A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent ( referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law ) granting exclusive rights in an invention ( or a design in the case of a design patent ) . In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to practice the invention , i.e. , put it into practical use . In the Holy Roman Empire , Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary , imperial patent was also the highest form of generally binding legal regulations , e. g. Patent of Toleration , Serfdom Patent etc . The opposite of letters patent are letters close ( Latin : litterae clausae ) , which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents . Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of open letter in that their audience is wide . It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee , for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace , who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse . Today , for example , it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain in the library of the House of Commons , where it may be freely perused by all members of parliament .",

It comprises parts of 17 townlands in three civil parishes : Killeely , St. Munchin 's , and St. Nicholas . The area of the North Liberties was originally part of Bunratty barony in County Clare . The 1609 royal charter from James I of England for the municipal corporation of Limerick granted it portions of rural land outside the municipal borough , and erected the whole area into a corporate county , the county of the city of Limerick , separate from the county-at-large of Limerick , and with its own sheriff and grand jury . The rural areas , called the liberties , were inside the county of the city but outside the borough boundary . There were three parts to the liberties : the small North Liberties , the larger South Liberties east of the borough on the opposite bank of the River Shannon , and Scattery Island far to the west at the Mouth of the Shannon . In the 1650s , after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland , the North Liberties were included in the Civil Survey but not the Down Survey , whose supervisor William Petty was himself awarded the lands . The Municipal Corporations ( Ireland ) Act 1840 detached all the liberties from the county of the city and attached them to the county-at-large . The 1846 Parliamentary Gazetteer and the census through to 1871 regarded the North Liberties as having been annexed to the barony of Pubblebrien , the rest of which was adjacent but south across the Shannon .
