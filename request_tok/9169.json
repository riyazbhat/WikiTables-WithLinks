  "/wiki/United_States_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/Western_Open": "The Western Open was a professional golf tournament in the United States , for most of its history an event on the PGA Tour . The tournament 's founding in 1899 actually pre-dated the start of the Tour , which is generally dated from 1916 , the year the PGA of America was founded . The Western Open , organized by the Western Golf Association , was first played in September 1899 at the Glen View Club in Golf , Illinois the week preceding the U.S. Open . At the time of its final edition in 2006 , it was the third-oldest active PGA Tour tournament , after the British Open ( 1860 ) and U.S. Open ( 1895 ) . The tournament was held a total of 103 times over the course of 108 years . The event was not held in 1900 , nor in 1918 because of World War I , and not from 1943-1945 because of World War II . Golfers from the United States won the tournament 77 times , and players from Scotland won it 15 times . Walter Hagen had the most victories with five wins , and 17 other players won the event at least twice . Two amateurs also won the tournament : Chick Evans in 1910 and Scott Verplank in 1985 . Beginning in 2007 , the Western Open was renamed the BMW Championship , part of the FedEx Cup playoff series , and played with the PGA Tour 's point system as the sole qualification standard . It is no longer open to amateurs . Title sponsorship was introduced in 1987 , and included Beatrice , Centel , Sprint , Motorola , Advil , Golf Digest , and Cialis .",

One of them was played at Newport Country Club and was won by William G. Lawrence , and the other took place at St Andrew 's Golf Club and was won by Laurence B. Stottard .

The home team won the first five contests , but with the competition 's resumption after the Second World War , repeated American dominance eventually led to a decision to extend the representation of Great Britain and Ireland to include continental Europe from 1979 . The inclusion of continental European golfers was partly prompted by the success of a new generation of Spanish golfers , led by Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido . In 1973 the official title of the British Team had been changed from Great Britain to Great Britain and Ireland , but this was simply a change of name to reflect the fact that golfers from the Republic of Ireland had been playing in the Great Britain Ryder Cup team since 1953 , while Northern Irish players had competed since 1947 . Since 1979 , Europe has won eleven times outright and retained the Cup once in a tied match , with eight American wins over this period . In addition to players from Great Britain and Ireland , the European team has included players from Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and Sweden . The Ryder Cup , and its counterpart the Presidents Cup , remain exceptions within the world of professional sports because the players receive no prize money despite the contests being high-profile events that bring in large amounts of money in television and sponsorship revenue . The current holders are Europe who won in 2018 at the Albatros Course at Le Golf National in Guyancourt , south-west of Paris , by a score of 17\u00bd to 10\u00bd .",
