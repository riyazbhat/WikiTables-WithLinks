Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles .

It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis",

After the boom came a long period of growth and stability . Agriculture ( and agricultural trade ) remained as the fundamental industry . From the 1920s through the 1970s , Hartford City continued to thrive .

It was strongly white supremacist not just against African Americans , but also Catholics and Jews , whose faith were commonly associated with Irish , Italian , Balkan , and Slavic immigrants and their descendants . In Indiana , the Klan generally did not practice overt violence but used intimidation in certain cases , whereas nationally the organization practiced political acts against minority ethnic and religious groups . The Indiana Klan rose to prominence beginning in the early 1920s after World War I , when white Protestants felt threatened by social and political issues , including changes caused by decades of heavy immigration from southern and eastern Europe . By 1922 the state had the largest organization nationally , and its membership continued to increase dramatically under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson . It averaged 2,000 new members per week from July 1922 to July 1923 , when he was appointed as the Grand Dragon of Indiana . He led the Indiana Klan and other chapters he supervised to break away from the national organization in late 1923 . Indiana 's Klan organization reached its peak of power in the following years , when it had 250,000 members , an estimated 30 % of native-born white men . By 1925 over half the elected members of the Indiana General Assembly , the Governor of Indiana , and many other high-ranking officials in local and state government were members of the Klan . Politicians had also learned they needed Klan endorsement to win office . That year Stephenson was charged and convicted for the rape and murder of Madge Oberholtzer , a young schoolteacher . His vile behavior caused a sharp drop in Klan membership , which decreased further with his exposure to the press of secret deals and the Klan 's bribery of public officials",

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture .

In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament .

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40 % of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture .

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University",
