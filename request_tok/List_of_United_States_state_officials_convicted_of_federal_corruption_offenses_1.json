  "/wiki/R._Budd_Dwyer": "Robert Budd Dwyer ( November 21 , 1939 - January 22 , 1987 ) was the 30th State Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the state 's 50th district . He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20 , 1981 , until his death by suicide during a press conference . In the early 1980s , Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer 's administration . A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee . In 1986 , Dwyer was convicted for accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract . He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy , mail fraud , perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering , and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23 , 1987 . On January 22 , 1987 , Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of Harrisburg where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters , by shooting himself with a .357 Magnum revolver . Dwyer 's suicide was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania . Throughout Dwyer 's trial and after his conviction , Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted , and that his conviction resulted from political persecution . In 2010 , the prosecution 's main witness , William Trickett Smith , maintained that his testimony at Dwyer 's 1986 trial - in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe , and that Dwyer accepted this offer - was truthful , and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe . Moreover , Smith stated in October 1984 - the year before his own trial - that he offered Dwyer a bribe , and that Dwyer accepted it .",

  "/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act": "The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization . The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing , closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to , for example , murder , to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally . RICO was enacted by section 901 ( a ) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 ( Pub.L . 91-452 , 84 Stat . 922 , enacted October 15 , 1970 ) and is codified at 18 U.S.C . ch . 96 as 18 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 . G. Robert Blakey , an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee , drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee 's chairman , Senator John Little McClellan . It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 , and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon . While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime , its later application has been more widespread . Beginning in 1972 , 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct .",
