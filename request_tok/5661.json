While Halo 2 's release had set industry records , the mainstream press was not fully involved in covering the game ; part of Microsoft 's strategy was to fully involve casual readers and the press in the story . The saturation of advertising and promotions led Wired to state : The release of Halo 3 this week was an event that stretched far beyond our little gaming world . Everyone from The New York Times to Mother Jones wanted to cover it . Released on September 25 , 2007 , Halo 3 became the biggest entertainment debut in history , earning more than $ 170 million in a few days and selling a record 3,300,000 copies in its first week of sales alone .

The game 's development began in 2006 , after the creation of its game engine , the Hedgehog Engine . It was initially conceived as a sequel to Sonic Adventure 2 , but developer Sonic Team began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games , and it was renamed Unleashed .
