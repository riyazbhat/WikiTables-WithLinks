He was an outspoken Democrat in politics , opposed to slavery but unsympathetic to abolitionism .

He also wrote many hymns , some of which are still used today . One popular hymn he wrote is There is no Name so Sweet on Earth .

  "/wiki/Bishop": "A bishop is an ordained , consecrated , or appointed member of the Christian clergy who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight . Within the Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox , Moravian , Anglican , Old Catholic and Independent Catholic churches , as well as the Assyrian Church of the East , bishops claim apostolic succession , a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles . Within these churches , bishops are seen as those who possess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy , including other bishops . Some Protestant churches , including the Lutheran and Methodist churches , have bishops serving similar functions as well , though not always understood to be within apostolic succession in the same way . A person ordained as a deacon , priest , and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ( ministerial ) priesthood , given responsibility by Christ to govern , teach , and sanctify the Body of Christ . Priests , deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry",
  "/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church": "The Methodist Episcopal Church ( MEC ) was the oldest and largest Methodist denomination in the United States from its founding in 1784 until 1939 . It was also the first religious denomination in the US to organize itself on a national basis . In 1939 , the MEC reunited with two breakaway Methodist denominations ( the Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church , South ) to form the Methodist Church . In 1968 , the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church . The MEC 's origins lie in the First Great Awakening when Methodism emerged as an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England that stressed the necessity of being born again and the possibility of attaining Christian perfection . By the 1760s , Methodism had spread to the Thirteen Colonies , and Methodist societies were formed under the oversight of John Wesley . As in England , American Methodists remained affiliated with the Church of England , but this state of affairs became untenable after the American Revolution . In response , Wesley ordained the first Methodist elders for America in 1784 . Under the leadership of its first bishops , Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury , the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted episcopal polity and an itinerant model of ministry that saw circuit riders provide for the religious needs of a widespread and mobile population . Early Methodism was countercultural in that it was anti-elitist and anti-slavery , appealing especially to African Americans and women . While critics derided Methodists as fanatics , the Methodist Episcopal Church continued to grow , especially during the Second Great Awakening in which Methodist revivalism and camp meetings left its imprint on American culture . In the early 19th century , the MEC became the largest and most influential religious denomination in the United States",
