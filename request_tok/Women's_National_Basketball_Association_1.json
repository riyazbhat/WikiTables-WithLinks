Along with the Minnesota Lynx , the club was established in 1999 as part of the league 's expansion from ten to twelve teams . The Miracle , the club 's previous moniker , originated that year in Orlando , Florida , as the sister team to the NBA 's Orlando Magic . Financial straits left the Miracle teetering on the brink of disbanding before the Mohegan Indian tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun , becoming the first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise . The derivative of the club 's name comes from its affiliation with Mohegan Sun , while the team 's logo is reflective of a modern interpretation of an ancient Mohegan symbol . Capitalizing on the popularity of women 's basketball in the state , as a result of the success of the UConn Huskies , the Sun also held the distinction of being the only WNBA franchise not to share its market with an NBA team from 2003 until the Seattle SuperSonics relocated , leaving the Storm as an independent team in Seattle . The Sun has qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in eight of its fourteen years in Connecticut",
