  "/wiki/Big_Stone_County_Courthouse": "The Big Stone County Courthouse in Ortonville , Minnesota is the center of government for Big Stone County , Minnesota . The county was established by the Minnesota Legislature in 1862 , but the government was not organized until 1873 , when Governor Horace Austin appointed three county commissioners . They did nothing , so Governor Cushman Kellogg Davis appointed three replacement commissioners in 1874 . The county seat was established at Ortonville in 1874 and three elected commissioners took office in the beginning of 1877 . The organization was challenged in court , and the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the county had not properly been organized . The county was declared organized in 1881 by the Minnesota Legislature . The first courthouse , a wood frame structure , was built in October 1882 , but was destroyed by fire on October 31 , 1885 . A new wood frame courthouse was built in 1886 , and the county later built a granite jail building in 1895 . In 1901 , the county decided to replace the wood-frame courthouse with a brick building . Architect Fremont D. Orff designed the building , and Ole H. Olsen of Stillwater , Minnesota was awarded the construction contract . The building was completed in 1902 . The previous wooden courthouse was donated to the local school district , which used it for a classroom until it was demolished in 1918 .",

  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
