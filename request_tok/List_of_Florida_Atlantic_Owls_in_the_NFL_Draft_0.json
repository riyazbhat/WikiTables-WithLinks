The team won a championship in their inaugural NFL season , as well as in the 1954 , 1955 , and 1964 seasons , and in a feat unequaled in any of the North American major professional sports , played in their league championship game in each of the Browns ' first ten years of existence . From 1965 to 1995 , they qualified to play in the NFL playoffs 14 times , but did not win another championship or play in the Super Bowl during that period .

After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans , a compromise was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the Baltimore Ravens as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel .",
