  "/wiki/James_Watt": "James Watt FRS FRSE ( /w\u0252t/ ; 30 January 1736 ( 19 January 1736 OS ) - 25 August 1819 ) was a Scottish inventor , mechanical engineer , and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen 's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1776 , which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world . While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow , Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines . He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder . Watt introduced a design enhancement , the separate condenser , which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power , efficiency , and cost-effectiveness of steam engines . Eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion , greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water . Watt attempted to commercialise his invention , but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775 . The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man . In his retirement , Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work . He developed the concept of horsepower , and the SI unit of power , the watt , was named after him .",

  "/wiki/Cybernetics": "Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems - their structures , constraints , and possibilities . Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine . In other words , it is the scientific study of how humans , animals and machines control and communicate with each other . Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop - originally referred to as a circular causal relationship - that is , where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner ( feedback ) that triggers a system change . Cybernetics is relevant to , for example , mechanical , physical , biological , cognitive , and social systems . The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular , causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal , and again to action . Its focus is how anything ( digital , mechanical or biological ) processes information , reacts to information , and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks . Cybernetics includes the study of feedback , black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms , machines and organizations including self-organization . Concepts studied by cyberneticists include , but are not limited to : learning , cognition , adaptation , social control , emergence , convergence , communication , efficiency , efficacy , and connectivity . In cybernetics these concepts ( otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering ) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device . The word cybernetics comes from Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( kybern\u0113tik\u1e17 ) , meaning governance , i.e. , all that are pertinent to \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 ( kybern\u00e1\u014d ) , the latter meaning to steer , navigate or govern , hence \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ( kyb\u00e9rn\u0113sis ) , meaning government , is the government while \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( kybern\u1e17t\u0113s ) is the governor or helmperson of the ship .

Examples of complex systems are Earth 's global climate , organisms , the human brain , infrastructure such as power grid , transportation or communication systems , social and economic organizations ( like cities ) , an ecosystem , a living cell , and ultimately the entire universe . Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies , competitions , relationships , or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment . Systems that are complex have distinct properties that arise from these relationships , such as nonlinearity , emergence , spontaneous order , adaptation , and feedback loops , among others .

Park was studying in Germany . Back in the United States Park lived in Wollaston , Massachusetts and earned in 1923 a degree in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . After this he went to the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , Sweden to improve his knowledge on operational calculus . Park started working for General Electric , where he created his 1929 Park 's transformation paper , followed by Stone and Webster Engineering in Boston as an electrical engineer and for American Cyanamid as a chemical engineer doing physics research .

  "/wiki/Dqo_transformation": "The direct-quadrature-zero ( DQZ or DQ0 or DQO , sometimes lowercase ) transformation or zero-direct-quadrature ( 0DQ or ODQ , sometimes lowercase ) transformation is a tensor that rotates the reference frame of a three-element vector or a three-by-three element matrix in an effort to simplify analysis . The DQZ transform is the product of the Clarke transform and the Park transform , first proposed in 1929 by Robert H. Park . The DQZ transform is often used in the context of electrical engineering with three-phase circuits . The transform can be used to rotate the reference frames of ac waveforms such that they become dc signals . Simplified calculations can then be carried out on these dc quantities before performing the inverse transform to recover the actual three-phase ac results . As an example , the DQZ transform is often used in order to simplify the analysis of three-phase synchronous machines or to simplify calculations for the control of three-phase inverters . In analysis of three-phase synchronous machines the transformation transfers three-phase stator and rotor quantities into a single rotating reference frame to eliminate the effect of time-varying inductances .",

  "/wiki/Vector_control_(motor)": "Vector control , also called field-oriented control ( FOC ) , is a variable-frequency drive ( VFD ) control method in which the stator currents of a three-phase AC electric motor are identified as two orthogonal components that can be visualized with a vector . One component defines the magnetic flux of the motor , the other the torque . The control system of the drive calculates the corresponding current component references from the flux and torque references given by the drive 's speed control . Typically proportional-integral ( PI ) controllers are used to keep the measured current components at their reference values . The pulse-width modulation of the variable-frequency drive defines the transistor switching according to the stator voltage references that are the output of the PI current controllers . FOC is used to control AC synchronous and induction motors . It was originally developed for high-performance motor applications that are required to operate smoothly over the full speed range , generate full torque at zero speed , and have high dynamic performance including fast acceleration and deceleration . However , it is becoming increasingly attractive for lower performance applications as well due to FOC 's motor size , cost and power consumption reduction superiority . It is expected that with increasing computational power of the microprocessors it will eventually nearly universally displace single-variable scalar volts-per-Hertz ( V/f ) control .",

VFDs are used in applications ranging from small appliances to large compressors . About 25 % of the world 's electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in industrial applications . Systems using VFDs can be more efficient than those using throttling control of fluid flow , such as in systems with pumps or fans .

The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields , from aerospace engineering to economics . In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner . While some decision problems can not be taken apart this way , decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively . Likewise , in computer science , if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems , then it is said to have optimal substructure . If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems , so that dynamic programming methods are applicable , then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems . In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation .",
  "/wiki/Harold_Stephen_Black": "Harold Stephen Black ( April 14 , 1898 - December 11 , 1983 ) was an American electrical engineer , who revolutionized the field of applied electronics by discovering the negative feedback amplifier in 1927 . To some , his discovery is considered the most important breakthrough of the twentieth century in the field of electronics , since it has a wide area of application . This is because all electronic devices ( vacuum tubes , bipolar transistors and MOS transistors ) are inherently nonlinear , but they can be made substantially linear with the application of negative feedback . Negative feedback works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity ( or in other words , smaller distortion/intermodulation ) . By sacrificing gain , it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier . However , a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate . Once the stability problem is solved , the negative feedback amplifier is extremely useful in the field of electronics . Black published a famous paper , Stabilized feedback amplifiers , in 1934 .",

Kalman filters also are one of the main topics in the field of robotic motion planning and control , and they are sometimes included in trajectory optimization . The Kalman filter also works for modeling the central nervous system 's control of movement . Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback , use of the Kalman filter supports a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of the motor system and issuing updated commands . The algorithm works in a two-step process . In the prediction step , the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables , along with their uncertainties . Once the outcome of the next measurement ( necessarily corrupted with some amount of error , including random noise ) is observed , these estimates are updated using a weighted average , with more weight being given to estimates with higher certainty .

  "/wiki/Fokker\u2013Planck_equation": "In statistical mechanics , the Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle under the influence of drag forces and random forces , as in Brownian motion . The equation can be generalized to other observables as well . It is named after Adriaan Fokker and Max Planck , and is also known as the Kolmogorov forward equation , after Andrey Kolmogorov , who independently discovered the concept in 1931 . When applied to particle position distributions , it is better known as the Smoluchowski equation ( after Marian Smoluchowski ) , and in this context it is equivalent to the convection-diffusion equation . The case with zero diffusion is known in statistical mechanics as the Liouville equation . The Fokker-Planck equation is obtained from the master equation through Kramers-Moyal expansion . The first consistent microscopic derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Nikolay Krylov . The Smoluchowski equation is the Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density function of the particle positions of Brownian particles .",

  "/wiki/Autopilot": "An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft , marine craft or spacecraft without constant manual control by a human operator being required . Autopilots do not replace human operators , but instead they assist them in controlling the vehicle . This allows them to focus on broader aspects of operations such as monitoring the trajectory , weather and systems . The autopilot is often used in conjunction with the autothrottle , when present , which is the analogous system controlling the power delivered by the engines . The autopilot system on airplanes is sometimes colloquially referred to as George .",

He was the son of astronomer Mikhail Lyapunov and the brother of pianist and composer Sergei Lyapunov . Lyapunov is known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system , as well as for his many contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory .",
  "/wiki/Stability_theory": "In mathematics , stability theory addresses the stability of solutions of differential equations and of trajectories of dynamical systems under small perturbations of initial conditions . The heat equation , for example , is a stable partial differential equation because small perturbations of initial data lead to small variations in temperature at a later time as a result of the maximum principle . In partial differential equations one may measure the distances between functions using Lp norms or the sup norm , while in differential geometry one may measure the distance between spaces using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance . In dynamical systems , an orbit is called Lyapunov stable if the forward orbit of any point is in a small enough neighborhood or it stays in a small ( but perhaps , larger ) neighborhood . Various criteria have been developed to prove stability or instability of an orbit . Under favorable circumstances , the question may be reduced to a well-studied problem involving eigenvalues of matrices . A more general method involves Lyapunov functions . In practice , any one of a number of different stability criteria are applied .",
  "/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell": "James Clerk Maxwell FRS FRSE ( 13 June 1831 - 5 November 1879 ) was a Scottish scientist in the field of mathematical physics . His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation , bringing together for the first time electricity , magnetism , and light as different manifestations of the same phenomenon . Maxwell 's equations for electromagnetism have been called the second great unification in physics after the first one realised by Isaac Newton . With the publication of A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field in 1865 , Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light . He proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena . The unification of light and electrical phenomena led his prediction of the existence of radio waves . Maxwell is also regarded as a founder of the modern field of electrical engineering . He helped develop the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution , a statistical means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases . He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks ( trusses ) like those in many bridges . His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics , laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics . Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics . His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein ."
