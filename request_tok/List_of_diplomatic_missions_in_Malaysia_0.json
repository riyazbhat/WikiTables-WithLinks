The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 .

  "/wiki/Kelantan": "Kelantan ( Malay pronunciation : [ k\u0259\u02c8lantan ] ; Jawi : \u06a9\u0644\u0646\u062a\u0646 ; Kelantanese : Kelat\u00e9 ) is a state of Malaysia . The capital and royal seat is Kota Bharu . The honorific name of the state is Darul Naim ( Jawi : \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u064a\u0645 , The Blissful Abode ) . Kelantan is located in the north-eastern corner of the peninsula . Kelantan , which is said to translate as the Land of Lightning ( see alternate theories below ) , is an agrarian state with green paddy fields , rustic fishing villages and casuarina-lined beaches . Kelantan is home to some of the most ancient archaeological discoveries in Malaysia , including several prehistoric aboriginal settlements . Due to Kelantan 's relative isolation and largely rural lifestyle , Kelantanese culture differs somewhat from Malay culture in the rest of the peninsula ; this is reflected in the cuisine , arts and the unique Kelantanese Malay language , which is unintelligible even for some speakers of standard Malay . Kelantan is positioned in the north-east of Peninsular Malaysia . It is bordered by Narathiwat Province of Thailand to the north , Terengganu to the south-east , Perak to the west and Pahang to the south . To the north-east of Kelantan is the South China Sea ."
