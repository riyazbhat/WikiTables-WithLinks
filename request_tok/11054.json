Originally released in Japanese arcades in April 2007 , the title was ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 home consoles in Japan in May 2008 , with a North American Xbox 360-exclusive version released in English in September 2008 by Aksys Games . It was later released in the PAL region in 2009 for both systems by 505 Games ( Europe ) and Aksys Games ( Australia ) . A Microsoft Windows version , ported in collaboration with DotEmu and distributed via Steam , was released on July 7 , 2015 as Battle Fantasia : Revised Edition . The game 's development was headed by Emiko Iwasaki , who had previously served as illustrator for the company 's Guilty Gear series , and features three-dimensional character models restricted to a two-dimensional plane . Battle Fantasia retains a number of features of its predecessor including fast-paced gameplay , colorful anime-style graphics , and over-the-top effects , yet was designed to be a more basic representation of the fighting genre . The game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games , and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook , and borrows many superficial elements from role-playing games including damage represented as numbers and a text-heavy story mode , which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world . Battle Fantasia met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mixed to average reviews from critics .",
