  "/wiki/Mystery_film": "A mystery film is a genre of film that revolves around the solution of a problem or a crime . It focuses on the efforts of the detective , private investigator or amateur sleuth to solve the mysterious circumstances of an issue by means of clues , investigation , and clever deduction . The plot often centers on the deductive ability , prowess , confidence , or diligence of the detective as they attempt to unravel the crime or situation by piecing together clues and circumstances , seeking evidence , interrogating witnesses , and tracking down a criminal . Suspense is often maintained as an important plot element . This can be done through the use of the soundtrack , camera angles , heavy shadows , and surprising plot twists . Alfred Hitchcock used all of these techniques , but would sometimes allow the audience in on a pending threat then draw out the moment for dramatic effect . This genre has ranged from early mystery tales , fictional or literary detective stories , to classic Hitchcockian suspense-thrillers to classic private detective films . A related film subgenre is spy films .",

  "/wiki/Science_fiction_film": "Science fiction film ( or sci-fi film ) is a genre that uses speculative , fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science , such as extraterrestrial lifeforms , alien worlds , extrasensory perception and time travel , along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft , robots , cyborgs , interstellar travel or other technologies . Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held . The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously . In the late 1970s , big-budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades .",
  "/wiki/Musical_film": "Musical film is a film genre with many songs in the movies . The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film 's characters , but in some cases , they serve merely as breaks in the storyline , often as elaborate production numbers . The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology . Typically , the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater . Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater ; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching . In a sense , the viewer becomes the diegetic audience , as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it .",

  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",

  "/wiki/Silent_film": "A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound ( and in particular , no audible dialogue ) . In silent films for entertainment , the plot may be conveyed by the use of title cards , written indications of the plot and key dialogue lines . The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself , but because of the technical challenges involved , the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system . The term silent film is something of a misnomer , as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds . During the silent era that existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s , a pianist , theater organist - or even , in large cities , a small orchestra - would often play music to accompany the films . Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music , or improvisation . Sometimes a person would even narrate the intertitle cards for the audience . Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the video did not exist , music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience . The term is also frequently used to describe sound-era films that have a recorded music-only soundtrack without dialogue , such as City Lights and The Artist . The term silent film is a retronym - a term created to retroactively distinguish something . Early sound films , starting with The Jazz Singer in 1927 , were variously referred to as the talkies , sound films , or talking pictures . Within a decade , the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased , and the industry had moved fully into the sound era , in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue , music and sound effects .",

  "/wiki/Dark_comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .",

Rotterdam is known for its Erasmus University , its riverside setting , lively cultural life , maritime heritage and modern architecture .

The Rhine , Meuse and Scheldt give waterway access into the heart of Western Europe , including the highly industrialized Ruhr .
