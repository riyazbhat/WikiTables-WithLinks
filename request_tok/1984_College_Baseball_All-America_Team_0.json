  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position",

  "/wiki/Strikeouts": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out",

  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15",
  "/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

One of the most prolific home run hitters in baseball history , McGwire holds the major league career record for at bats per home run ratio ( 10.6 ) , and is the former record holder for both home runs in a single season ( 70 in 1998 ) and home runs hit by rookie ( 49 in 1987 ) . He ranks 11th all time in home runs with 583 , and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons , while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245 . Further , he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter , producing a career .394 on-base percentage ( OBP ) and twice leading the major leagues in bases on balls . Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons . A right-handed batter and thrower , McGwire stood 6 feet 5 inches ( 1.96 m ) tall and weighed 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) during his playing career .

  "/wiki/Home_runs": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner )",
  "/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game": "The Major League Baseball All-Star Game , also known as the Midsummer Classic , is an annual professional baseball game sanctioned by Major League Baseball ( MLB ) contested between the All-Stars from the American League ( AL ) and National League ( NL ) , currently selected by fans for starting fielders , by managers for pitchers , and by managers and players for reserves . The game usually occurs on either the second or third Tuesday in July , and is meant to mark a symbolic halfway-point in the MLB season ( though not the mathematical halfway-point which , for most seasons , is usually found within the previous calendar week ) . Both of the major leagues share an All-Star break , with no regular-season games scheduled on the day before or two days after the All-Star Game itself . Some additional events and festivities associated with the game take place each year close to and during this break in the regular season . No official MLB All-Star Game was held in 1945 including the official selection of players due to World War II travel restrictions . Two All-Star Games were held each season from 1959 to 1962 .

  "/wiki/Silver_Slugger_Award": "The Silver Slugger Award is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position in both the American League and the National League , as determined by the coaches and managers of Major League Baseball . These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners , including batting average , slugging percentage , and on-base percentage , in addition to coaches ' and managers ' general impressions of a player 's overall offensive value . Managers and coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their own team . The Silver Slugger was first awarded in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby , the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats . The award is a bat-shaped trophy , 3 feet ( 91 cm ) tall , engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver . The prize is presented to outfielders irrespective of their specific position . This means that it is possible for three left fielders , or any other combination of outfielders , to win the award in the same year , rather than one left fielder , one center fielder , and one right fielder . In addition , only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award ; lineups in the American League include a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order , so the designated hitter receives the award instead . Home run record-holder Barry Bonds won twelve Silver Slugger Awards in his career as an outfielder , the most of any player . He also won the award in five consecutive seasons twice in his career : from 1990 to 1994 , and again from 2000 to 2004 .

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well",
  "/wiki/Billy_Bates_(baseball)": "William Derrick Bates ( born December 7 , 1963 ) is a former Major League Baseball ( MLB ) second baseman and pinch runner who played for the Milwaukee Brewers and the 1990 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds . In 29 career games , Bates had a batting average of .125 with six hits , two runs batted in ( RBI ) , 11 runs , ten strikeouts , and eight stolen bases . Though defensively he played as a second baseman , the Reds primarily used Bates as a pinch runner . After he scored the winning run in Game 2 of the 1990 World Series , Bates never played in MLB again . Born in Houston , Bates attended the University of Texas and , in his freshman season , won the 1983 College World Series as a part of the Texas Longhorns baseball team . For the next two seasons , Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team , a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America . Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft , he rose through the Brewers ' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles . He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989 , after Milwaukee 's starting second baseman became injured . A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990 , where the Reds used him as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason . Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series , Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2 , as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics , four games to none . Following the World Series championship , Bates spent two years in minor league baseball , one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs , and last played exhibition baseball in 1995 . After retirement , he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston and coached his daughter 's softball team",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error",

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast",
  "/wiki/Gene_Larkin": "Eugene Thomas Larkin ( born October 24 , 1962 ) is a former switch-hitting first baseman , designated hitter , and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played his entire seven-season career with the Minnesota Twins . During his playing career he wore # 9 for Minnesota , and was a member of both the 1987 and 1991 World Series championship teams . He is best known for hitting the series-winning single , a deep fly ball that was not caught by the Braves ' drawn-in outfield and scored Dan Gladden from third base during the tenth inning in Game 7 of the 1991 Series . Larkin was one of seven Twins to be part of both the 1987 and 1991 World Series teams . The other six were Randy Bush , Greg Gagne , Kirby Puckett , Al Newman , Kent Hrbek and Gladden . Larkin attended Columbia University , where he played for the Lions and was later drafted in the 20th round of the 1984 amateur draft . He was the first alumnus of Columbia University to make the major leagues since Lou Gehrig . He also graduated from Chaminade High School in Mineola , New York .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base",

Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 . ( His granddaughter , Jane Forbes Clark , is the current chairman of the Board of Directors . ) The erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall .
