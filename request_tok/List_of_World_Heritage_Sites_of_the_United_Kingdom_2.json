  "/wiki/Chatham_Dockyard": "Chatham Dockyard was a Royal Navy Dockyard located on the River Medway in Kent . Established in Chatham in the mid-16th century , the dockyard subsequently expanded into neighbouring Gillingham ( at its most extensive , in the early 20th century , two-thirds of the dockyard lay in Gillingham , one-third in Chatham ) . It came into existence at the time when , following the Reformation , relations with the Catholic countries of Europe had worsened , leading to a requirement for additional defences . For 414 years Chatham Royal Dockyard provided over 500 ships for the Royal Navy , and was at the forefront of shipbuilding , industrial and architectural technology . At its height , it employed over 10,000 skilled artisans and covered 400 acres ( 1.6 km\u00b2 ) . Chatham dockyard closed in 1984 , and 84 acres ( 340,000 m2 ) of the Georgian dockyard is now managed as the Chatham Historic Dockyard visitor attraction by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust .",
  "/wiki/Kent": "Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties . It borders Greater London to the north-west , Surrey to the west and East Sussex to the south-west . The county also shares borders with Essex along the estuary of the River Thames ( connected by land via High Speed 1 and the Dartford Crossing ) , and with the French department of Pas-de-Calais through the Channel Tunnel . The county town is Maidstone . Kent was among the first British territories conquered and settled by Anglo-Saxons . Canterbury Cathedral in Kent has been the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury , leader of the Church of England , since the Reformation . Prior to that it was built by Catholics , dating back to the conversion of England to Catholicism by Saint Augustine that began in the 6th century . Before the English Reformation the cathedral was part of a Benedictine monastic community known as Christ Church , Canterbury , as well as being the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury . The last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury was Reginald Pole . Rochester Cathedral is also in Kent , in Medway . It is the second-oldest cathedral in England , with Canterbury Cathedral being the oldest . Between London and the Strait of Dover , which separates it from mainland Europe , Kent has seen both diplomacy and conflict , ranging from the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004 to the Battle of Britain in World War II .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",
  "/wiki/Creswell_Crags": "Creswell Crags is an enclosed limestone gorge on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire , England , near the villages of Creswell and Whitwell . The cliffs in the ravine contain several caves that were occupied during the last ice age , between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago . Its caves contain the northernmost cave art in Europe . The evidence of occupation found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years is regarded as internationally unique in demonstrating how prehistoric people managed to live at the extreme northernmost limits of their territory during the Late Pleistocene period . The caves contain occupation layers with evidence of flint tools from the Mousterian , proto-Solutrean , Creswellian and Maglemosian cultures . They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods . Evidence of Neolithic , Bronze Age , Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there . There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000-60,000 years ago , a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago . The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects associated with the caves , including a stuffed cave hyena . As a result of its unique features , Creswell Crags has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . It has also been put forward as a potential World Heritage Site . In 2006-07 , the B6042 road was re-routed from its path through the gorge , by approximately 150 metres ( 160 yd ) to the north , to minimise traffic impact on the site .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

  "/wiki/Slate_industry_in_Wales": "The existence of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period , when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium , now Caernarfon . The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century , then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century , at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales , including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda , the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis , the Nantlle Valley quarries , and Blaenau Ffestiniog , where the slate was mined rather than quarried . Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world , and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world . Slate is mainly used for roofing , but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring , worktops and headstones . Up to the end of the 18th century , slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord , carted slate to the ports , and then shipped it to England , Ireland and sometimes France . Towards the close of the century , the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves , on a larger scale . After the government abolished slate duty in 1831 , rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports . The slate industry dominated the economy of north-west Wales during the second half of the 19th century , but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere . In 1898 , a work force of 17,000 men produced half a million tons of slate . A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline , and the First World War saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry . The Great Depression and Second World War led to the closure of many smaller quarries , and competition from other roofing materials , particularly tiles , resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s . Slate production continues on a much reduced scale .",
