  "/wiki/Pipestone_National_Monument": "Pipestone National Monument is located in southwestern Minnesota , just north of the city of Pipestone , Minnesota . It is located along the highways of U.S. Route 75 , Minnesota State Highway 23 and Minnesota State Highway 30 . The catlinite , or pipestone , has been traditionally used to make ceremonial pipes , vitally important to traditional Plains Indian religious practices . The quarries are sacred to many of the tribes of North America , including the Dakota , Lakota , and other tribes of Native Americans , and were neutral territory where all Nations could quarry stone for ceremonial pipes . The Sioux tribes may have taken control of the quarries around 1700 , but the Minnesota pipestone has been found inside North American burial mounds dating from long before that , and ancient Indian trails leading to the area suggest pipestone may have been quarried there for many centuries . As the United States grew westward in the 19th century , pipes found their way into white society through trade . To protect their source , the Yankton Sioux secured free and unrestricted access via The Treaty With The Yankton Sioux , which was signed on April 19 , 1858 . The land was acquired by the federal government in 1893 . In 1928 , the Yankton Sioux , then resettled on a reservation 150 miles ( 240 km ) away , sold their claim to the federal government . The National Monument was established by an act of Congress on August 25 , 1937 , and the establishing legislation restored quarrying rights to the Indians . Today only people of Native American ancestry are allowed to quarry the pipestone . A boundary change occurred on June 18 , 1956 .",
  "/wiki/Catlinite": "Catlinite , also called pipestone , is a type of argillite ( metamorphosed mudstone ) , usually brownish-red in color , which occurs in a matrix of Sioux Quartzite . Because it is fine-grained and easily worked , it is prized by Native Americans , primarily those of the Plains nations for use in making ceremonial pipes such as chanunpas . Pipestone quarries are located and preserved in Pipestone National Monument outside Pipestone , Minnesota , in Pipestone County , Minnesota , and at the Pipestone River in Ontario , Canada .",
  "/wiki/Plains_Indians": "Plains Indians , Interior Plains Indians or Indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have traditionally lived on the greater Interior Plains ( i.e . the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies ) in North America . Their historic nomadic culture and development of equestrian culture and resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for American Indians everywhere . Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree . The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries , following the vast herds of buffalo , although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture . These include the Blackfoot , Arapaho , Assiniboine , Cheyenne , Comanche , Crow , Gros Ventre , Kiowa , Lakota , Lipan , Plains Apache ( or Kiowa Apache ) , Plains Cree , Plains Ojibwe , Sarsi , Nakoda ( Stoney ) , and Tonkawa . The second group of Plains Indians were semi-sedentary , and , in addition to hunting buffalo , they lived in villages , raised crops , and actively traded with other tribes . These include the Arikara , Hidatsa , Iowa , Kaw ( or Kansa ) , Kitsai , Mandan , Missouria , Omaha , Osage , Otoe , Pawnee , Ponca , Quapaw , Wichita , and the Santee Dakota , Yanktonai and Yankton Dakota .",
  "/wiki/Ceremonial_pipe": "A ceremonial pipe is a particular type of smoking pipe , used by a number of Native American cultures in their sacred ceremonies . Traditionally they are used to offer prayers in a religious ceremony , to make a ceremonial commitment , or to seal a covenant or treaty . The pipe ceremony may be a component of a larger ceremony , or held as a sacred ceremony in and of itself . Indigenous peoples of the Americas who use ceremonial pipes have names for them in each culture 's indigenous language . Not all cultures have pipe traditions , and there is no single word for all ceremonial pipes across the hundreds of diverse Native American languages .",
  "/wiki/Stick_style": "The Stick style was a late-19th-century American architectural style , transitional between the Carpenter Gothic style of the mid-19th century , and the Queen Anne style that it had evolved into by the 1890s .

  "/wiki/Sioux_Quartzite": "The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota , South Dakota , and Iowa , and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States . It was formed by braided river deposits , and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the North American craton . In human history , it provided the catlinite , or pipestone , that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes . With the arrival of Europeans , it was heavily quarried for building stone , and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls , South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest . Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in Jasper , Minnesota at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry , which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5 , 1978 . Jasper , Minnesota contains many turn-of-the-century quartzite buildings , including the school , churches and several other public and private structures , mostly abandoned .",

  "/wiki/Pipestone_Indian_School_Superintendent's_House": "The Pipestone Indian School Superintendent 's House served as the home of the superintendent of the Pipestone Indian School from its construction in 1907 to the closure of the school in 1953 . It then served as a private residence until 1983 , and is now used for storage by the present owner , Minnesota West Community and Technical College . In 2006 the property was added to the 10 Most Endangered Historic Places list of the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota as it was considered to be in immediate need of stabilization . The superintendent 's house is the last of what was once a boarding school campus of more than 60 buildings , and one of only 11 built of red quartzite . The Indian school was built under the auspices of the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 , which sought to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream American culture . Education was recognized by the federal government as a way to increase control over them while at the same time separating them from their cultural ties . Children from many parts of the Midwestern United States and from tribes including the Dakota , Oneida , Pottawatomie , Arikaree , Sac and Fox were brought to the school , often with strong objections from their parents . With changing government policies the school declined and was closed in 1953 .",
  "/wiki/Native_American_boarding_schools": "Native American boarding schools , also known as Indian Residential Schools , were established in the United States during the late 19th and mid 20th centuries with a primary objective of assimilating Native American children and youth into Euro-American culture , while at the same time providing a basic education in Euro-American subject matters . These boarding schools were first established by Christian missionaries of various denominations , who often started schools on reservations , especially in the lightly populated areas of the West . The government paid religious orders to provide basic education to Native American children on reservations . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , with the last residential schools closing as late as 1973 . The Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) founded additional boarding schools based on the assimilation model of the off-reservation Carlisle Indian Industrial School . Children were typically immersed in European-American culture through forced changes that removed indigenous cultural signifiers . These methods included being forced to have European-American style haircuts , being forbidden to speak their Indigenous languages , and having their real names replaced by European names to both civilize and Christianize them . ( Similarly , Evenk children were required to speak Russian when sent to boarding schools in the former Soviet Union . ) The experience of the schools was usually harsh and sometimes deadly , especially for the younger children who were forcibly separated from their families . The children were forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures . Investigations of the later twentieth century have revealed many documented cases of sexual , manual , physical and mental abuse occurring mostly in church-run schools . In summarizing the recent scholarship from Native perspectives , Dr. Julie Davis argues :",

  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",
