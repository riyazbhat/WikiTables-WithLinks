  "/wiki/Tower_mill": "A tower mill is a type of vertical windmill consisting of a brick or stone tower , on which sits a wooden 'cap ' or roof , which can rotate to bring the sails into the wind . This rotating cap on a firm masonry base gave tower mills great advantages over earlier post mills , as they could stand much higher , bear larger sails , and thus afford greater reach into the wind . Windmills in general had been known to civilization for centuries , but the tower mill represented an improvement on traditional western-style windmills . The tower mill was an important source of power for Europe for nearly 600 years from 1300-1900 , contributing to 25 percent of the industrial power of all wind machines before the advent of the steam engine and coal power . It represented a modification or a demonstration of improving and adapting technology that had been known by humans for ages . Although these types of mills were effective , some argue that , owing to their complexity , they would have initially been built mainly by the most wealthy individuals .",

G\u0127arb started life as a small hamlet centuries ago . The word G\u0127arb is Maltese for West , so it should be no surprise that the village is the most westerly place on Gozo . One can see its ancient roots in the centre of the village where some houses have fine examples of decorated stone balconies . G\u0127arb was created as a parish in 1679 , a move which gave impetus for the building of a new , baroque parish church . Built between 1699 and 1729 , it has an elegant fa\u00e7ade which has been compared with Francesco Borromini 's Church of Saint Agnes in Piazza Navona , Rome . The village square , so quintessentially Gozitan , has become the view on many a postcard . On the square is a folklore museum housing all sorts of memorabilia retelling the Islands ' rural history . G\u0127arb lies in some of Gozo 's most scenic countryside , particularly at Dbie\u0121i , the highest hill on the Island . Also at Dbie\u0121i is a centre for Gozitan crafts . Within the limits of G\u0127arb is the Chapel of San Dimitri . According to legend , the first chapel was built on the cliff side by a woman whose son was freed from captivity by St. Demetrius .",

The Roman Baths and an early Christian cemetery at G\u0127ar Gerduf , referred to by Gozitan historian Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis as Roman Catacombs , are also significant discoveries . However , to date , these historic sites are not accessible to the public . Ta ' Ker\u010bem evolved into a village community in the late Middle Ages , around an ancient chapel dedicated to Pope Gregory the Great built around 1581 . The site gained historical importance due to the annual traditional St. Gregory procession from the Matrix church in Rabat ( Victoria ) to this medieval chapel , upon the saint 's feast , namely on 12 March . The chapel was , however , replaced by the present parish church in 1851 , which in turn was enlarged later on to its present state between 1906 and 1910 . Ta ' Kercem became a distinct parish on 10 March 1885 by Bishop Pietru Pace . The Ta ' Kercem parish church is the only Gozitan church which is jointly dedicated to two saints . As referred earlier , it was traditionally dedicated to Pope Gregory , but , since 17 August 1885 , the church was additionally co-dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help . The village of Ta ' Ker\u010bem has a population of around 1700 people .",
