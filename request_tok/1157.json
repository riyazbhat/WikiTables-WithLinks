Dialogue may include the actual words of real-life persons , as recorded in historical documents . Docudrama producers sometimes choose to film their reconstructed events in the actual locations in which the historical events occurred . A docudrama , in which historical fidelity is the keynote , is generally distinguished from a film merely based on true events , a term which implies a greater degree of dramatic license ; and from the concept of historical drama , a broader category which may also encompass largely fictionalized action taking place in historical settings or against the backdrop of historical events . As a portmanteau , docudrama is sometimes confused with docufiction .

Forward time travel , outside the usual sense of the perception of time , is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity . However , making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology . As for backward time travel , it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it , such as a rotating black hole . Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has a very limited support in theoretical physics , and usually is connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes , also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges .",

The vessel went down 11 miles ( 18 km ) off the Old Head of Kinsale , :429 Ireland , killing 1,198 and leaving 761 survivors . The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany , contributed to the American entry into World War I and became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought . :497-503 Lusitania fell victim to torpedo attack relatively early in the First World War , before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood . The contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship 's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany . Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship . At the time she was sunk , she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition ( .303 caliber ) , almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings ( for a total of some 50 tons ) , and 3,240 brass percussion fuses , in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696 .

Whilst the Voyager and Pioneer probes have travelled into local interstellar space , the purpose of these uncrewed craft was specifically interplanetary and they are not predicted to reach another star system ( although Voyager 1 will travel to within 1.7 light years of Gliese 445 in approximately 40,000 years . ) Several preliminary designs for starships have been undertaken through exploratory engineering , using feasibility studies with modern technology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future . In April 2016 , scientists announced Breakthrough Starshot , a Breakthrough Initiatives program , to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of small centimeter-sized light sail spacecraft , named StarChip , capable of making the journey to Alpha Centauri , the nearest extrasolar star system , at speeds of 20 % and 15 % of the speed of light , taking between 20 and 30 years to reach the star system , respectively , and about 4 years to notify Earth of a successful arrival .

  "/wiki/Black_hole": "A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing - no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light - can escape from it . The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , no locally detectable features appear to be observed . In many ways , a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe . Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace . The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 , although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958 . Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity ; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity . The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality . Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle .",

Unlike the other ships in the class , Olympic had a long career spanning 24 years from 1911 to 1935 . This included service as a troopship during the First World War , which gained her the nickname Old Reliable . She returned to civilian service after the war , and served successfully as an ocean liner throughout the 1920s and into the first half of the 1930s , although increased competition , and the slump in trade during the Great Depression after 1930 , made her operation increasingly unprofitable . Olympic was the largest ocean liner in the world for two periods during 1911-13 , interrupted only by the brief tenure of the slightly larger Titanic ( which had the same dimensions but higher gross tonnage owing to revised interior configurations ) , before she was then surpassed by SS Imperator . Olympic also retained the title of the largest British-built liner until RMS Queen Mary was launched in 1934 , interrupted only by the short careers of her slightly larger sister ships . The Olympic was withdrawn from service and sold for scrap in 1935 ; demolition was completed in 1937 . Decorative elements of Olympic were removed and sold at auction before she was scrapped , and now adorn buildings and a cruise ship . By contrast with Olympic , the other two ships in the class , Titanic and Britannic , had short service lives : in 1912 , Titanic collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic on her maiden voyage and sank ; in 1916 , Britannic struck a mine and sank in the Kea Channel in Greece .

Throughout her career , Minogue has been known for reinventing herself in fashion and music . She is described as a style icon and has been recognised with several honorific nicknames , most notably the Princess of Pop . Minogue is also recognised as the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time . Born and raised in Melbourne , she has worked and lived in the United Kingdom since the 1990s . Minogue achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours , where she played tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson . She came to prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman and released by PWL . By the time she released her fourth album in the early 1990s , she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia , including I Should Be So Lucky , The Loco-Motion , Hand on Your Heart , Better the Devil You Know and Step Back in Time . Minogue , however , felt alienated and dissatisfied with the little creative control she had over her music . In 1992 , she left PWL and signed with Deconstruction Records , where she released Kylie Minogue ( 1994 ) and Impossible Princess ( 1997 ) , both of which received positive reviews from critics , with the latter being often described as her most personal and best work .

  "/wiki/Pastiche": "A pastiche is a work of visual art , literature , theatre , or music that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists . Unlike parody , pastiche celebrates , rather than mocks , the work it imitates . The word pastiche is a French cognate of the Italian noun pasticcio , which is a p\u00e2t\u00e9 or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients . Metaphorically , pastiche and pasticcio describe works that are either composed by several authors , or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists ' work . Pastiche is an example of eclecticism in art . Allusion is not pastiche . A literary allusion may refer to another work , but it does not reiterate it . Moreover , allusion requires the audience to share in the author 's cultural knowledge . Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of intertextuality .",

The TV show Doctor Who mainly features a single TARDIS used by the central character the Doctor . However , in the series other TARDISes are sometimes seen or used . The Doctor 's TARDIS has a number of features peculiar to it , notably due to its age and personality . While other TARDISes have the ability to change their appearance in order to blend in with their surroundings , the chameleon circuit in the Doctor 's TARDIS is broken , and it always resembles a police box . However , in the new series ( since 2005 ) , a perception filter is used to make the TARDIS blend in with the surroundings , so that it is often ignored by passersby . While the exterior is of limited size , the TARDIS is much bigger on the inside , containing an infinite number of rooms , corridors and storage spaces . Doctor Who has become so much a part of British popular culture that the shape of the police box has become associated with the TARDIS rather than with its real-world inspiration . [ nb 4 ] The name TARDIS is a registered trademark of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . The police box design has also been registered as a trademark by the BBC , despite the design having been created by the Metropolitan Police .
