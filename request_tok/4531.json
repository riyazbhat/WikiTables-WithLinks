  "/wiki/British_Antarctic_Territory": "The British Antarctic Territory ( BAT ) is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom as one of its 14 British Overseas Territories , of which it is by far the largest by area . It comprises the region south of 60\u00b0S latitude and between longitudes 20\u00b0W and 80\u00b0W , forming a wedge shape that extends to the South Pole , overlapping the Antarctic claims of Argentina ( Argentine Antarctica ) and Chile ( Chilean Antarctic Territory ) . The Territory was formed on 3 March 1962 , although the UK 's claim to this portion of the Antarctic dates back to letters patent of 1908 and 1917 . The area now covered by the Territory includes three regions which , before 1962 , were administered by the British as separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands : Graham Land , the South Orkney Islands , and the South Shetland Islands . The United Kingdom 's claim to the region has been suspended since the Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961 , Article 4 of which states No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting , supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica . No new claim , or enlargement of an existing claim , to territorial sovereignty , shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force . Most countries do not recognise territorial claims in Antarctica . The United Kingdom has ratified the treaty . In 2012 , the southern part of the territory was named Queen Elizabeth Land in honour of Queen Elizabeth II . The territory is inhabited by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations , and stations of Argentina , Chile and other countries . There are no native inhabitants .",

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14,200,000 square kilometres ( 5,500,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia . At 0.00008 people per square kilometre , it is by far the least densely populated continent . About 98 % of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Most of Antarctica is a polar desert , with annual precipitation of 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) along the coast and far less inland ; there has been no rain there for almost 2 million years , yet 80 % of the world freshwater reserves are stored there . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u221289.2 \u00b0C ( \u2212128.6 \u00b0F ) ( or even \u221294.7 \u00b0C ( \u2212135.8 \u00b0F ) as measured from space ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u221263 \u00b0C ( \u221281 \u00b0F ) . Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at research stations scattered across the continent . Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra . Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered , unseen until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf .",

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk . Over 40 % of its 207,600 square kilometres ( 80,200 sq mi ) is forested . Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing . Until the 20th century , different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus , including the Principality of Polotsk ( 11th to 14th centuries ) , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and the Russian Empire . In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution , Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People 's Republic , which was conquered by Soviet Russia . The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) . Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 . Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland , and were finalized after World War II . During WWII , military operations devastated Belarus , which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources . The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years .

The islands were vital naval and air bases on the route between the Americas and the Philippines and Australia and were claimed by both the United Kingdom and the United States . From 1939 to 1979 , they formed an Anglo-American condominium , with administration jointly exercised by the U.S. and the UK . This arrangement only covered Canton and Enderbury islands ; the remaining Phoenix Islands were still claimed by the U.S. under the Guano Islands Act , but aside from Hull Island were either abandoned or remained under exclusive British control until 1979 . The United States and the United Kingdom relinquished control over the islands to the government of newly independent Kiribati under the Treaty of Tarawa in 1979 and the Canton and Enderbury Islands Condominium ceased to exist . In this treaty , the U.S. acknowledged I-Kiribati sovereignty over fourteen islands , but reserved the right to military bases . Today the islands form part of the Phoenix Islands administrative group within the Republic of Kiribati . As of 2005 , the population of Canton Island was 41 , down from 61 in 2000 . In May 2010 the population was reportedly 24 , with 14 adults and 10 children . The island 's sole village is called Tebaronga . Enderbury is uninhabited .

The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",

  "/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia": "The Federated States of Micronesia ( /\u02ccma\u026akro\u028a\u02c8ni\u02d0\u0292\u0259/ ( listen ) ; abbreviated FSM and also known simply as Micronesia ) is an independent republic associated with the United States . It consists of four states - from west to east , Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae - that are spread across the Western Pacific Ocean . Together , the states comprise around 607 islands ( a combined land area of approximately 702 km2 or 271 sq mi ) that cover a longitudinal distance of almost 2,700 km ( 1,678 mi ) just north of the equator . They lie northeast of New Guinea , south of Guam and the Marianas , west of Nauru and the Marshall Islands , east of Palau and the Philippines , about 2,900 km ( 1,802 mi ) north of eastern Australia and some 4,000 km ( 2,485 mi ) southwest of the main islands of Hawaii . While the FSM 's total land area is quite small , it occupies more than 2,600,000 km2 ( 1,000,000 sq mi ) of the Pacific Ocean , giving the country the 14th-largest exclusive economic zone in the world . The sovereign island nation 's capital is Palikir , located on Pohnpei Island , while the largest city is Weno , located in the Chuuk Atoll . Each of its four states is centered on one or more main high islands , and all but Kosrae include numerous outlying atolls . The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the Caroline Islands in the wider region of Micronesia , which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries . The term Micronesia may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole . The FSM was formerly a part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) , a United Nations Trust Territory under U.S. administration , but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10 , 1979 , becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3 , 1986 , under a Compact of Free Association with the United States . Other neighboring island entities , and also former members of the TTPI , formulated their own constitutional governments and became the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) and the Republic of Palau ( ROP ) . The FSM has a seat in the United Nations and has been a member of the Pacific Community since 1983 .",

The CNMI includes the 14 northernmost islands in the Mariana Archipelago except the southernmost island of the chain , Guam , which is a separate U.S. territory . The CNMI and Guam are the westernmost territories of the United States . The United States Department of the Interior cites a landmass of 183.5 square miles ( 475.26 km2 ) . According to the 2010 United States Census , 53,883 people were living in the CNMI at that time . The vast majority of the population resides on Saipan , Tinian , and Rota . The other islands of the Northern Marianas are sparsely inhabited ; the most notable among these is P\u00e5gan , which for various reasons over the centuries has experienced major population flux , but formerly had residents numbering in the thousands . The administrative center is Capitol Hill , a village in northwestern Saipan . However , most publications consider Saipan to be the capital because the island is governed as a single municipality .",
  "/wiki/Palau": "Palau ( /p\u0259\u02c8la\u028a/ ( listen ) , historically Belau , Palaos , or Pelew ) , officially the Republic of Palau ( Palauan : Beluu er a Belau ) , is an island country located in the western Pacific Ocean .

The islands were first explored by Europeans in the 16th century , and were made part of the Spanish East Indies in 1574 . Following Spain 's defeat in the Spanish-American War in 1898 , the islands were sold to Imperial Germany in 1899 under the terms of the German-Spanish Treaty , where they were administered as part of German New Guinea . After World War I , the islands were made a part of the Japanese-ruled South Seas Mandate by the League of Nations . During World War II , skirmishes , including the major Battle of Peleliu , were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign .

  "/wiki/Panama_Canal_Zone": "The Panama Canal Zone ( Spanish : Zona del Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) was an unincorporated territory of the United States from 1903 to 1979 , centered on the Panama Canal and surrounded by the Republic of Panama . The zone consisted of the canal and an area generally extending five miles ( 8.0 km ) on each side of the centerline , excluding Panama City and Col\u00f3n , which otherwise would have been partly within the limits of the Zone . Its border spanned three of Panama 's provinces . When reservoirs were created to assure a steady supply of water for the locks , those lakes were included within the Zone . In 1904 , the Isthmian Canal Convention was proclaimed . In it , the Republic of Panama granted to the United States in perpetuity the use , occupation , and control of a zone of land and land under water for the construction , maintenance , operation , sanitation , and protection of the canal . From 1903 to 1979 , the territory was controlled by the United States , which had purchased the land from the private and public owners , built the canal and financed its construction . The Canal Zone was abolished in 1979 , as a term of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties two years earlier ; the canal itself was later under joint U.S.-Panamanian control until it was fully turned over to Panama in 1999 .",
  "/wiki/Panama": "Panama ( /\u02c8p\u00e6n\u0259m\u0251\u02d0/ ( listen ) PAN-\u0259-mah , /p\u00e6n\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0/ pan-\u0259-MAH ; Spanish : Panam\u00e1 IPA : [ pana\u02c8ma ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Panama ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 ) , is a transcontinental country in Central America and South America , bordered by Costa Rica to the west , Colombia to the southeast , the Caribbean Sea to the north , and the Pacific Ocean to the south . The capital and largest city is Panama City , whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country 's 4 million people . Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 . Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama 's GDP , although commerce , banking , and tourism are major and growing sectors . It is regarded as a high-income country . In 2018 Panama ranked 66th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index . In 2018 , Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America , according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index . Covering around 40 percent of its land area , Panama 's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals - some of them found nowhere else on earth ."
