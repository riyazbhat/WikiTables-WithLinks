  "/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a forward is a player position on the ice whose primary responsibility is to score and assist goals . Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",

  "/wiki/Defenceman": "Defence ( defense in the United States ) in ice hockey is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . They are often referred to as defencemen , D , D-men or blueliners ( the latter a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which represents the boundary of the offensive zone ; defencemen generally position themselves along the line to keep the puck in the zone ) . They were once called cover-point . A good defenceman is both strong in defensive and offensive play and for defenceman pairing also need to be good at defending and attacking . In regular play , two defencemen complement three forwards and a goaltender on the ice . Exceptions include overtime during the regular season and when a team is shorthanded ( i.e . has been assessed a penalty ) , in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender ; in National Hockey League play in overtime effective with the 2015-16 season the teams have only three position players and a goaltender on the ice and may use either two forwards and one defenceman ( typically ) , or conversely , two defencemen and one forward .",

  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",
