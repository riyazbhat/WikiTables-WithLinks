Niger is a developing country , which consistently ranks near the bottom in the United Nations ' Human Development Index ( HDI ) ; it was ranked 187th of 188 countries for 2015 and 189th out of 189 countries in the 2018 report . Many of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification . The economy is concentrated around subsistence , with some export agriculture in the more fertile south , and export of raw materials , especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position , desert terrain , inefficient agriculture , high fertility rates without birth control , and the resulting overpopulation , the poor educational level and poverty of its people , lack of infrastructure , poor healthcare , and environmental degradation . Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state . Historically , what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states . Since independence , Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule .",
