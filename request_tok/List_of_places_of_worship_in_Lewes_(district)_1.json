  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Roughcast": "Roughcast or pebbledash is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand , small gravel , and often pebbles or shells . The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop . The idea is to maintain an even spread , free from lumps , ridges or runs and without missing any background . Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix , whereas pebbledashing adds them on top . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910-1911 ) , roughcast used to be a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings , but it is now frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses , especially those built using timber framing ( half timber ) . Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours , and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded . Though it is an occasional home-design fad , its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5% . However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland , with a high percentage of new houses still being built with roughcasting . [ citation needed ] This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s , when housing was in greater demand , and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could , and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work , which also added rudimentary weather protection . Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building materials needed , although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all , but small and sharp flint chips , and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash . There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar , sharp-dash , sharpstone dash , thrown dash , pebble stucco , Derbyshire Spar , Yellow spar , golden gravel , black and white , and also sunflower .

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

  "/wiki/Dutch_gable": "A Dutch gable or Flemish gable is a gable whose sides have a shape made up of one or more curves and has a pediment at the top . The gable may be an entirely decorative projection above a flat section of roof line , or may be the termination of a roof , like a normal gable ( the picture of Montacute House , right , shows both types ) . The preceding is the strict definition , but the term is sometimes used more loosely , though the stepped gable should be distinguished from it . The term Dutch gable is also used in America and Australasia to refer to a gablet roof . The Dutch gable was a notable feature of the Renaissance architecture , which spread to northern Europe from the Low Countries , arriving in Britain during the latter part of the 16th century . Later Dutch gables with flowing curves became absorbed into Baroque architecture . Examples of Dutch-gabled buildings can be found in historic cities across Europe . In Potsdam , Germany , 150 red brick houses featuring steep Dutch gables form part of the city 's Dutch Quarter , while in Bruges , Belgium , a wide range of buildings featuring Dutch gables can be found . The Flemish culture also had a strong architectural impact in Arras , northern France . The style also spread beyond Europe , for example Barbados is well known for the Dutch gables on its historic buildings . Dutch settlers in South Africa also brought with them building styles from the Netherlands which included the use of prominent Dutch gables but adjusted to the Western Cape region where the style became known as Cape Dutch architecture .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ .

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

In the 1890s the village 's population grew from less than 100 to over 500 after a cement manufacturing plant opened nearby . The village is now associated with the urbanised area of Newhaven . There is no place called North Heighton although part of the South Downs above the village is called Heighton Hill , from which one can get to Norton , which lies north-east of South Heighton , and north of Bishopstone . It is a regular thoroughfare and point of rest for ramblers , and features a series of ponds , known locally as 'The Three Lakes ' , which were until the early 1990s open to the public . It remains a popular destination for local visitors , with its public house , The Hampden Arms , and until recently , its corner-shop and post office , which has now closed and been converted into a residential dwelling . South Heighton is one of many villages in the area which maintains a bonfire society , celebration and parade . South Heighton is famous for its secret tunnels , built and used for defence during the Second World War , which lie underneath most of the village , with the main entrance at Denton House . In 1998 , when work finished on the conversion of Denton House into flats and of the surrounding area into houses , the road was called Forward Close , after the ship associated with Newhaven and the secret tunnels , HMS Forward . Notable residents , past and present , include Ralph Reader , originator of the Scouting Gang Show and Ursula Mommens , the great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin and the great-great-granddaughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood .",
  "/wiki/Southover_General_Baptist_Chapel": "Southover General Baptist Chapel is a former Baptist place of worship in the ancient village of Southover , now part of the town and district of Lewes , one of six local government districts in the English county of East Sussex . Founded in 1741 as the first Baptist place of worship in the area , it attracted a congregation of General Baptists whose theological views gradually moved towards Unitarianism . This led to their union with the members of the nearby Westgate Chapel , after which the flint and brick building housed other congregations and secular groups before its conversion to a house . The building is protected as a Grade II by English Heritage .",
  "/wiki/Knapping": "Knapping is the shaping of flint , chert , obsidian or other conchoidal fracturing stone through the process of lithic reduction to manufacture stone tools , strikers for flintlock firearms , or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls , and flushwork decoration . The original Germanic term knopp meant strike , shape , or work , so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice . Modern usage is more specific , referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
