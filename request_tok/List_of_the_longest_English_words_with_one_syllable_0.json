  "/wiki/Word_Ways": "Word Ways : The Journal of Recreational Linguistics is a leading quarterly magazine on recreational linguistics , logology and word play . It was established by Dmitri Borgmann in 1968 at the behest of Martin Gardner . Howard Bergerson took over as editor-in-chief for 1969 , but stepped down when Greenwood Periodicals dropped the publication . A. Ross Eckler Jr. , a statistician at Bell Labs , became editor until 2006 , when he was succeeded by Jeremiah Farrell ( Butler University ) . Word Ways was the first periodical devoted exclusively to word play , and has become the foremost publication in that field . Lying on the midpoint of a spectrum from popular magazine to scholarly journal , it publishes articles on various linguistic oddities and creative use of language . This includes research into and demonstrations of anagrams , pangrams , lipograms , tautonyms , univocalics , word ladders , palindromes and unusually long words , as well as book reviews , literature surveys , investigations into questionable logological claims , puzzles and quizzes , mnemonics and a small measure of linguistically oriented fiction . Bestselling language author Willard R. Espy discovered Word Ways in 1972 , and eventually used material from several dozen articles in his Almanac of Words at Play anthologies . The first of these included complete subscription details for Word Ways , which generated so many inquiries that for decades the publishers were reluctant to change their address .",
  "/wiki/French_language": "French ( le fran\u00e7ais [ l\u0259 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b ] or la langue fran\u00e7aise [ la l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family . It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",
  "/wiki/Smurf": "The Smurfs ( French : Les Schtroumpfs ; Dutch : De Smurfen ) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small , blue , human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest . The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo ( the pen name of Pierre Culliford ) in 1958 , wherein they were known as Les Schtroumpfs . There are more than 100 Smurf characters , and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics , such as Jokey Smurf , who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs . Smurfette was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series . The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps , which came to represent freedom during the modern era . The word smurf is the original Dutch translation of the French schtroumpf , which , according to Peyo , is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist Andr\u00e9 Franquin when he could not remember the word salt . The Smurfs franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising , films , TV series , ice capades , video games , theme parks , and dolls .",
  "/wiki/Umberto_Eco": "Umberto Eco [ a ] OMRI ( 5 January 1932 - 19 February 2016 ) was an Italian novelist , literary critic , philosopher , semiotician , and university professor . He is widely known for his 1980 novel Il nome della rosa ( The Name of the Rose ) , a historical mystery combining semiotics in fiction with biblical analysis , medieval studies , and literary theory .

  "/wiki/General_American": "General American English or General American ( abbreviated GA or GenAm ) is the umbrella accent of American English spoken by a majority of Americans and widely perceived , among Americans , as lacking any distinctly regional , ethnic , or socioeconomic characteristics . In reality , it encompasses a continuum of accents rather than a single unified accent . Americans with high education , or from the North Midland , Western New England , and Western regions of the country , are the most likely to be perceived as having General American accents . The precise definition and usefulness of the term General American continue to be debated , and the scholars who use it today admittedly do so as a convenient basis for comparison rather than for exactness . Other scholars prefer the term Standard American English . Standard Canadian English is sometimes considered to fall under the phonological spectrum of General American , especially rather than the United Kingdom 's Received Pronunciation ; in fact , spoken Canadian English aligns with General American in nearly every situation where British and American accents differ .",
  "/wiki/Received_Pronunciation": "Received Pronunciation ( RP ) , commonly called BBC English and Standard British pronunciation or Southern British pronunciation , is an accent of Standard English in the United Kingdom and is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as the standard accent of English as spoken in the south of England , although it can be heard from native speakers throughout England and Wales . Peter Trudgill estimated in 1974 that 3 per cent of people in Britain were RP speakers , but this rough estimate has been questioned by the phonetician J. Windsor Lewis . Clive Upton notes higher estimates of 5% ( Romaine , 2000 ) and 10% ( Wells , 1982 ) but refers to all these as guesstimates that are not based on robust research . Formerly colloquially called the King 's English , RP enjoys high social prestige in Britain , being thought of as the accent of those with power , money , and influence , though it may be perceived negatively by some as being associated with undeserved privilege . Since the 1960s , a greater permissiveness toward regional English varieties has taken hold in education . The study of RP is concerned exclusively with pronunciation , whereas Standard English , the Queen 's English , Oxford English , and BBC English are also concerned with matters such as grammar , vocabulary , and style .",
  "/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences": "Many of the differences between American and British English date back to a time when spelling standards had not yet developed . For instance , some spellings seen as American today were once commonly used in Britain and some spellings seen as British were once commonly used in the United States . A British standard began to emerge following the 1755 publication of Samuel Johnson 's A Dictionary of the English Language , and an American standard started following the work of Noah Webster and in particular his An American Dictionary of the English Language , first published in 1828 . Webster 's efforts at spelling reform were somewhat effective in his native country , resulting in certain well-known patterns of spelling differences between the American and British varieties of English . However , English-language spelling reform has rarely been adopted otherwise , and so modern English orthography varies somewhat between countries and is far from phonemic in any country .",
  "/wiki/Brougham_(carriage)": "A brougham ( pronounced broom or brohm ) was a light , four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage built in the 19th century . [ note 1 ] It was named after the politician and jurist Lord Brougham , who had this type of carriage built to his specification by London coachbuilder Robinson & Cook in 1838 or 1839 . It had an enclosed body with two doors , like the rear section of a coach ; it sat two , sometimes with an extra pair of fold-away seats in the front corners , and with a box seat in front for the driver and a footman or passenger . Unlike a coach , the carriage had a glazed front window , so that the occupants could see forward . The forewheels were capable of turning sharply . A variant , called a brougham-landaulet , had a top collapsible from the rear doors backward . [ note 2 ] Three features specific to the Brougham were :",

  "/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw": "George Bernard Shaw ( /\u02c8b\u0259rn\u0251\u02d0rd/ ; 26 July 1856 - 2 November 1950 ) , known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw , was an Irish playwright , critic , polemicist and political activist . His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",
  "/wiki/Early_Modern_English": "Early Modern English or Early New English ( sometimes abbreviated EModE , EMnE , or EME ) is the stage of the English language from the beginning of the Tudor period to the English Interregnum and Restoration , or from the transition from Middle English , in the late 15th century , to the transition to Modern English , in the mid-to-late 17th century . Before and after the accession of James I to the English throne in 1603 , the emerging English standard began to influence the spoken and written Middle Scots of Scotland . The grammatical and orthographical conventions of literary English in the late 16th century and the 17th century are still very influential on modern Standard English . Most modern readers of English can understand texts written in the late phase of Early Modern English , such as the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare , and they have greatly influenced Modern English . Texts from the earlier phase of Early Modern English , such as the late-15th century Le Morte d'Arthur ( 1485 ) and the mid-16th century Gorboduc ( 1561 ) , may present more difficulties but are still obviously closer to Modern English grammar , lexicon , and phonology than are 14th-century Middle English texts , such as the works of Geoffrey Chaucer .",
  "/wiki/Zoom_Schwartz_Profigliano": "Zoom Schwartz Profigliano , also known as figliano , is a verbal tag drinking game with many variations . One player at a time is active ( it ) . The active player states a command from a predefined set of words , which typically include zoom , schwartz , and profigliano . The command shifts active status to another player , 'tagging ' them . Play continues until a player fouls by giving a command when not active , by failing to give a command promptly when active , or in some cases by giving a command which is prohibited by the current state of the game . The game lends itself to bluffing where the active player uses nonverbal communication to suggest that someone else is active . In a high-speed game a player might give a command passing active status to one player while looking at a different player , confusing the situation .",
  "/wiki/Schnapps": "Schnapps ( /\u0283n\u0251\u02d0ps/ or /\u0283n\u00e6ps/ ) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms , including distilled fruit brandies , herbal liqueurs , infusions , and flavored liqueurs made by adding fruit syrups , spices , or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits . The English loanword schnapps is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ \u0283naps ] ( listen ) ( plural : Schn\u00e4pse ) which is used in reference to spirit drinks . The word Schnaps stems from Low German language and is related to the German term schnappen , which refers to the fact that the spirit or liquor drink is usually consumed in a quick slug from a small glass ( i.e. , a shot glass ) . In British English , a corresponding term is dram [ of liquor ] .",
