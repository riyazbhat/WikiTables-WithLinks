Its eruptive history was unknown to most before the pre-eruption volcanic activities of 1991 , just before June . Pinatubo was heavily eroded , inconspicuous and obscured from view . It was covered with dense forests which supported a population of several thousand indigenous Aetas . Pinatubo is most notorious for its VEI-6 eruption on June 15 , 1991 , the second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska . Complicating the eruption was the arrival of Typhoon Yunya , bringing a lethal mix of ash and rain to towns and cities surrounding the volcano . Predictions at the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas , saving many lives . Surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic surges , pyroclastic falls , and subsequently , by the flooding lahars caused by rainwater re-mobilizing earlier volcanic deposits . This caused extensive destruction to infrastructure and changed river systems for years after the eruption . Minor dome-forming eruptions inside the caldera continued from 1992 to 1993 . The effects of the 1991 eruption were felt worldwide . It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes ( 1.1\u00d71010 short tons ) or 10 km3 ( 2.4 cu mi ) of magma , and 20,000,000 tonnes ( 22,000,000 short tons ) of SO2 , bringing vast quantities of minerals and toxic metals to the surface environment .",

  "/wiki/Mount_Tambora": "Mount Tambora , or Tomboro , is an active stratovolcano in the northern part of Sumbawa , one of the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia . It was formed due to the active subduction zones beneath it , and before its 1815 eruption , it was more than 4,300 metres ( 14,100 feet ) high , making it one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago . Tambora 's 1815 eruption was the largest in recorded human history . The magma chamber under Tambora had been drained by pre-1815 eruptions and underwent several centuries of dormancy as it refilled . Volcanic activity reached a peak that year , culminating in the eruption . The explosion was heard on Sumatra island , more than 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 miles ) away . Heavy volcanic ash rains were observed as far away as Borneo , Sulawesi , Java and Maluku islands , and the maximum elevation of Tambora was reduced from about 4,300 metres ( 14,100 ft ) to 2,850 metres ( 9,350 feet ) . Although estimates vary , the death toll was at least 71,000 people . The eruption caused global climate anomalies in the following years , while 1816 became known as the year without a summer due to the impact on North American and European weather . In the Northern Hemisphere , crops failed and livestock died , resulting in the worst famine of the century . During a 2004 excavation , archaeologists discovered the remains of a house destroyed and buried by the 1815 eruption .

Huaynaputina is a large volcanic crater , lacking an identifiable mountain profile , with an outer stratovolcano and three younger volcanic vents . The vents of Huaynaputina form a north-northwest-south-southeast trend . The volcano erupted several times during the Holocene , the largest eruption took place in the year 1600 . The 1600 eruption was the largest historical eruption in South America , measuring 6 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . It occurred on 19 February and continued with a series of events into March . Witnessed by the people of the city of Arequipa , its impact in the region was severe , wiping out vegetation and burying the surroundings with 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) of volcanic rock ; it also damaged infrastructure and economic resources . The eruption had significant effects on Earth 's climate , decreasing temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere , causing floods , famines and cold waves in numerous places , and depositing several million tons of acid . The climate disruption caused social upheaval in many countries such as Russia and may have played a role in the onset of the Little Ice Age . Huaynaputina has not erupted since 1600 .

The fourth ( of seven ) eruptive phase was phreatomagmatic , indicating that a Crater lake was already present at that time . The caldera has since accumulated a 250 m ( 820 ft ) deep crater lake , which has a greenish color as a result of dissolved minerals . Fumaroles are found on the lake floor and hot springs occur on the eastern flank of the volcano . Quilotoa is a tourist site of growing popularity . The route to the summit ( the small town of Quilotoa ) is generally traveled by hired truck or bus from the town of Zumbahua 17 km to the South , or more commonly by bus from Latacunga . Visitors no longer have to pay two US dollars each to look from the lip of the caldera . There are a number of simple hostels in the immediate area offering services such as mules and guides . Activities include a four to five-hour hike around the caldera ( whose diameter is just over 3 km ) . The caldera rim is highly irregular and reaches its maximum elevations ( 3810 m to the N , 3894 m to the NW and 3915 m to the SE ) at three lava domes .",
  "/wiki/Northern_Volcanic_Zone": "The Andean Volcanic Belt is a major volcanic belt along the Andean cordillera in Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru . It is formed as a result of subduction of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate . The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps . The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style , products , and morphology . While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to , there are significant differences within volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes . Despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism , the Andean Volcanic Belt has a broad range of volcano-tectonic settings , as it has rift systems and extensional zones , transpressional faults , subduction of mid-ocean ridges and seamount chains as well as a large range of crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths and different amounts of crustal assimilations . Romeral in Colombia is the northernmost active member of the Andean Volcanic Belt . South of latitude 49\u00b0 S within the Austral Volcanic Zone volcanic activity decreases with the southernmost volcano Fueguino in Tierra del Fuego archipelago .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Segara_Anak": "Segara Anak is a crater lake in the caldera that formed during the explosive volcanic eruption of Mount Samalas in 1257 .

  "/wiki/1257_Samalas_eruption": "In 1257 , a catastrophic eruption occurred at Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok . The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7 , [ a ] making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the current Holocene epoch . It created eruption columns reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and pyroclastic flows that buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighbouring island of Sumbawa . The flows destroyed human habitations , including the city of Pamatan , which was the capital of a kingdom on Lombok . Ash from the eruption fell as far as 340 kilometres ( 210 mi ) away in Java ; the volcano deposited more than 10 cubic kilometres ( 2.4 cu mi ) of rocks and ash . The eruption was witnessed by people who recorded it on the Babad Lombok , a document written on palm leaves . It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak . Later volcanic activity created more volcanic centres in the caldera , including the Barujari cone , which remains active . The aerosols injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface , cooling the atmosphere for several years and leading to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere , although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated . The eruption may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age , a centuries-long cold period during the last thousand years . Before the site of the eruption was known , an examination of ice cores around the world had found a large spike in sulfate deposition around 1257 , providing strong evidence of a large volcanic eruption having occurred somewhere in the world . In 2013 , scientists linked the historical records about Mount Samalas to these spikes .",

  "/wiki/Little_Ice_Age": "The Little Ice Age ( LIA ) was a period of cooling that occurred after the Medieval Warm Period . Although it was not a true ice age , the term was introduced into scientific literature by Fran\u00e7ois E. Matthes in 1939 . It has been conventionally defined as a period extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries , but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850 . The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals : one beginning about 1650 , another about 1770 , and the last in 1850 , all separated by intervals of slight warming . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report considered the timing and areas affected by the Little Ice Age suggested largely independent regional climate changes rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation . At most , there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period . Several causes have been proposed : cyclical lows in solar radiation , heightened volcanic activity , changes in the ocean circulation , variations in Earth 's orbit and axial tilt ( orbital forcing ) , inherent variability in global climate , and decreases in the human population ( for example from the Black Death and the colonization of the Americas ) .",

At 2,744 m ( 9,003 ft ) , it is the highest mountain of the Changbai and Baekdudaegan ranges . Koreans assign a mythical quality to the volcano and its caldera lake , considering it to be their country 's spiritual home . It is the highest mountain in North Korea , the Korean Peninsula , and Northeast China . A large crater lake , called Heaven Lake , is in the caldera atop the mountain . The caldera was formed by the VEI 7 Millennium or Tianchi eruption of 946 , which erupted about 100-120 km3 ( 24-29 cu mi ) of tephra . This was one of the largest and most violent eruptions in the last 5,000 years ( alongside the Minoan eruption , the Hatepe eruption of Lake Taupo in around AD 180 , the 1257 eruption of Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani , and the 1815 eruption of Tambora ) .

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty .

  "/wiki/Ceboruco_(volcano)": "Ceboruco is a dacitic stratovolcano located in Nayarit , Mexico , northwest of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt . The largest eruption , the Jala Plinian eruption , was around 930 AD \u00b1200 , VEI 6 , releasing 11 cubic kilometres ( 2.6 cu mi ) of tephra . The most recent and best documented eruption from Ceboruco lasted from 1870-1875 , with fumarole activity lasting well into the 20th century . The mountain features one large caldera , created during the Jala eruption , with a smaller crater nested inside that formed when the Dos Equis lava dome collapsed during the Coapales eruption around 1100 AD . Within both of these craters , are several explosive volcanic features , including scoria deposits , lava domes , and pyroclastic domes , or cinder cone volcanoes . Cooled lava flows preserved around the volcano keep a record of the recent eruptions . Before the Jala eruption , there is record of one major lava flow , called the Destiladero flow . During the 500 years after the Jala eruption , the volcano was at its most active , leaving record of six major lava flows : the Copales , El Caj\u00f3n , Coapan I , Coapan II , El Norte , and Ceboruco flows , all before the Spanish arrived in 1521 . The volcano remained active until the next major eruption in 1870 , however volcanism was , for the most part , constrained within the calderas . Lava extruded from the volcano is primarily trachydacite to trachyandesite in composition , transitioning from more andesitic to more dacitic compositions over time . The magma is likely a mix from three different sources , a rhyodacite source , a dacite source ( likely itself a mixture of rhyodacite and basalt ) , and a mafic source .",
