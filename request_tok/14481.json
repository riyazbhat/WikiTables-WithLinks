  "/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King": "William Lyon Mackenzie King OM CMG PC ( December 17 , 1874 - July 22 , 1950 ) , commonly known as Mackenzie King or by the initials WLMK , was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s . He served as the tenth prime minister of Canada in 1921-1926 , 1926-1930 and 1935-1948 . He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) when he mobilized Canadian money , supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining morale on the home front . A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office , he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history . Trained in law and social work , he was keenly interested in the human condition ( as a boy , his motto was Help those that can not help themselves ) , and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state . King acceded to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919 . Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War , he reconciled factions , unifying the Liberal Party and leading it to victory in the 1921 election . His party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada , 1930-35 ; he returned when the economy was on an upswing . He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie Provinces , while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians . During the Second World War , he carefully avoided the battles over conscription , patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War . Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership , he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support . Scholars attribute King 's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada 's needs .",

The Union government that had governed Canada through the First World War was defeated , and replaced by a Liberal government under the young leader William Lyon Mackenzie King . A new third party , the Progressive Party , won the second most seats in the election . Since the 1911 election , the country had been governed by the Conservatives , first under the leadership of Prime Minister Robert Borden and then under Prime Minister Arthur Meighen . During the war , the Conservatives had united with the pro-conscription Liberal-Unionists and formed a Union government . A number of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , mostly Quebecers , stayed loyal to Sir Wilfrid Laurier , however , and they maintained their independence . When Laurier died , he was replaced as leader by the Ontarian Mackenzie King . After the 1919 federal budget , a number of western unionist MPs , who were former Liberals , left the Union government in protest against high tariffs on farm products imposed by the budget . Led by Thomas Alexander Crerar , the group became known as the Progressive Party . Also running were a number of Labour advocates , foremost amongst them J. S. Woodsworth of Winnipeg , who had organized their political movement after the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 . Meighen had played a key role in violently suppressing the strikers and this earned him the animosity of organized labour . Meighen attempted to make the Unionist party a permanent alliance of Tories and Liberals by renaming it the National Liberal and Conservative Party , but the name change failed , and most Unionist Liberals either returned to the Liberal fold or joined the new Progressive Party .",

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal Party formed a minority government . This precipitated the King-Byng Affair . The Liberals under Mackenzie King won fewer seats than Arthur Meighen 's Conservatives . A third party , the Progressives , which had nominated candidates for the first time in the 1921 election , held the balance of the seats . King decided to hold on to power with the help of the Progressives . The Progressives were closely aligned with the Liberals , and enabled King to form a minority government . This plan was complicated by the fact that his party won fewer seats than the Conservatives , and that King himself had lost his seat in the House of Commons . Meighen was outraged by King 's move , and demanded that King resign from the Prime Minister 's office . King asked a Liberal Member of Parliament from Prince Albert , Saskatchewan to resign so that he could run in the resulting by-election . Prince Albert was one of the safest seats in Canada for the Liberals , and King won easily . With King back in Parliament , a huge scandal rocked the King cabinet when one of his appointees was discovered to be accepting bribes from a male lover [ citation needed ] .",
  "/wiki/King-Byng_Affair": "The King-Byng affair was a Canadian constitutional crisis that occurred in 1926 , when the Governor General of Canada , the Lord Byng of Vimy , refused a request by his prime minister , William Lyon Mackenzie King , to dissolve parliament and call a general election . The prime minister ( leader of the Liberal Party ) and the governor general agreed in October 1925 that , before the next election were to be called , the Conservative Party should be given the chance to form a government because technically it had the most seats . The Conservatives were not given this chance by 26 June 1926 when the prime minister asked the governor general to dissolve parliament anyway . This request was refused ( the climax of the constitutional crisis ) . The prime minister resigned and the governor general invited the Conservative Party to form a government . This government lost a motion of no confidence on 2 July 1926 , and the governor general agreed to dissolve parliament immediately . Following the election on 14 September , King reprised his role as prime minister . The crisis came to redefine the role of governor general , not only in Canada but throughout the Dominions , becoming a major impetus in negotiations at Imperial Conferences held in the late 1920s that led to the adoption of the Statute of Westminster 1931 . According to constitutional convention in the British Empire , the governor general once represented both the sovereign in his imperial council and in his Canadian council , but the convention had evolved with Byng 's predecessors , the Canadian government , and the Canadian people into a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government . After 1931 , the governor general remained an important figure in Canadian governance as a constitutional watchdog , but the role was shorn of its previous imperial duties .",

Known to friends as Bungo , Byng was born to a noble family at Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire , England and educated at Eton College , along with his brothers . Upon graduation , he received a commission as a militia officer and saw service in Egypt and Sudan before enrolling in the Staff College at Camberley . There , he befriended individuals who would be his contemporaries when he attained senior rank in France . Following distinguished service during the First World War - specifically , with the British Expeditionary Force in France , in the Battle of Gallipoli , as commander of the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge , and as commander of the British Third Army - Byng was in 1919 himself elevated to the peerage . In 1921 , King George V , on the recommendation of Prime Minister David Lloyd George , appointed him to replace the Duke of Devonshire as Canada 's governor general , a post he occupied until the Viscount Willingdon suceeded him in 1926 . Byng proved to be popular with Canadians due to his war leadership , though his stepping directly into political affairs became the catalyst for widespread changes to the role of the Crown in all of the British Dominions . After his viceregal tenure , Byng returned to the UK to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and was promoted within the peerage to become Viscount Byng of Vimy . Three years after attaining the rank of field marshal , he died at his home on 6 June .",

Mackenzie King , however , was determined to continue to govern with the support of the Progressive Party . The combined Liberal and Progressive caucuses gave Mackenzie King a plurality of seats in the House of Commons , and the ability to form a minority government . The agreement collapsed , however , following a scandal , and Mackenzie King approached the Governor-General , Baron Byng of Vimy , to seek dissolution of the Parliament . Byng refused on the basis that the Conservatives had won the largest number of seats in the prior election , and called upon Meighen to form a government . Prime Minister Meighen 's government was soon defeated in a vote of non-confidence , and Byng agreed to dissolve Parliament and call new elections . Mackenzie King effectively campaigned against Byng in the election instead of against Meighen , and won the largest number of seats in the House of Commons despite receiving a smaller proportion of the popular vote than the Tories . The Liberals did not run candidates in all ridings , having an informal electoral pact with the Progressives and Liberal-Progressives . Note in particular the election results in Manitoba , where Meighen 's party captured almost 40 percent of the vote , twice the vote share of any other party , but no seats . Thus , Mackenzie King 's Liberals were able to govern with the support of Liberal-Progressive Members of Parliament .",

The central issue was the economy , which was still in the depths of the Great Depression . Bennett , in office since the 1930 election , had done little to stimulate the economy during his first few years , believing that a policy of high tariffs and trade within the British Empire would correct the depression . In the last months of his time in office , he reversed his position , however , copying the popular New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the United States . Upset about high unemployment and inaction by the federal government , voters were unwilling to allow the Conservatives to continue to govern , despite their change of policy .

It was held March 26 , 1940 , to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 19th Parliament of Canada . Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal Party was re-elected to their second consecutive majority government . The election was overshadowed by the Second World War , which caused many Canadians to rally around the government . In response to this , the Conservative Party of Robert Manion ran on a platform advocating the creation of an all-party national unity government and ran under the name National Government in this election . Though Manion was personally opposed to conscription , the Liberals faced intense pressure in Quebec on the question and promised not to institute the measure . This promise was to haunt the Liberals as they faced increasing pressure from the military and especially from English Canada to bring in the measure . To release him from his 1940 promise , King called a plebiscite in 1942 on the question . See also Conscription Crisis of 1944 . It was the most successful election for the Liberal Party in its history , in which it captured 73 % of the seats in the House of Commons . Social Credit ran jointly with the New Democracy movement of William Duncan Herridge .

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal government was re-elected to its third consecutive government , although this time with a minority government as the Liberals fell five seats short of a majority . Although the election officially resulted in a minority government , the election of eight Independent Liberal MPs , most of whom did not run as official Liberals because of their opposition to conscription ( see Conscription Crisis of 1944 ) , gave the King government an effective working majority in parliament . Most of the Independent Liberal MPs joined ( or re-joined ) the Liberal caucus following World War II when the conscription issue became moot . As King was defeated in his own riding of Prince Albert , fellow Liberal William MacDiarmid , who was re-elected in the safe seat of Glengarry , resigned so that a by-election could be held , which was subsequently won by King . The federal election was the first since the victory of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the Saskatchewan provincial election , and many predicted a major breakthrough for the CCF nationally . A Gallup poll from September 1943 showed the CCF with a one-point lead over both the Liberals and Conservatives . The party was expected to win 70 to 100 seats , possibly even enough to form a minority government . Despite the expectations , the party only won 28 seats . 1945 was also the first test of the newly named Progressive Conservatives .

Macdonald was born in Scotland ; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada ( today in eastern Ontario ) . As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston , which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada . By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 . Macdonald 's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion , using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party , promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy , and completing the railway .

In his youth he was a popular figure in the court of Queen Victoria , and became well known to the public after publishing a best-selling account of his travels in the North Atlantic . He is now best known as one of the most successful diplomats of his time . His long career in public service began as a commissioner to Syria in 1860 , where his skilful diplomacy maintained British interests while preventing France from instituting a client state in Lebanon . After his success in Syria , Dufferin served in the Government of the United Kingdom as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Under-Secretary of State for War . In 1872 he became the third Governor General of Canada , bolstering imperial ties in the early years of the Dominion , and in 1884 he reached the pinnacle of his diplomatic career as eighth Viceroy of India . Following his retirement from the diplomatic service in 1896 , his final years were marred by personal tragedy and a misguided attempt to secure his family 's financial position . His eldest son was killed in the Second Boer War and another son badly wounded . He was chairman of a mining firm that went bankrupt after swindling people , although he was ignorant of the matter . His biographer Davenport-Hines says he was imaginative , sympathetic , warm-hearted , and gloriously versatile . He was an effective leader in Lebanon , Canada and India , averted war with Russia , and annexed Burma . He was careless with money but charming in high society on three continents .",

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald .

He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice .

His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms , such as the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax . Prior to his political career , he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal . He later ran for the Progressive Conservatives and won in a landslide in the 1984 Canadian federal election , defeating John Turner of the Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the NDP , not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50 % of the vote for the first time since 1958 and increasing his party 's seats by 111 , up to 211 seats , the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history . The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the Liberals ' victory in 2015 . Throughout his political career , Mulroney 's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage . He brought forth a constitutional reform , the Meech Lake Accord , in 1987 , meant to persuade the government of Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments . It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline , and thus met its demise in 1990 . This loss led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992 . These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the Charlottetown Accord , which would create extensive changes to the constitution , including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society . However , the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992 . Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney 's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord .",

As prime minister , Borden led Canada through World War I and its immediate aftermath . His government passed the War Measures Act , created the Canadian Expeditionary Force , and eventually introduced compulsory military service , which sparked the 1917 conscription crisis . On the home front , it dealt with the consequences of the Halifax Explosion , introduced women 's suffrage for federal elections , and used the North-West Mounted Police to break up the 1919 Winnipeg general strike . For the 1917 federal election ( the first in six years ) , Borden created the Unionist Party , an amalgam of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals ; his government was re-elected with an overwhelming majority . Borden retired from politics in 1920 , having accepted a knighthood in 1915 - the last Canadian prime minister to be knighted .

  "/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1917": "The Conscription Crisis of 1917 ( French : Crise de la conscription de 1917 ) was a political and military crisis in Canada during World War I . It was mainly caused by disagreement on whether men should be conscripted to fight in the war , but also brought out many issues regarding relations between French Canadians and English Canadians . Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription ; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France . Led by Henri Bourassa , they felt their only loyalty was to Canada . English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire . On January 1 , 1918 , the Unionist government began to enforce the Military Service Act . The act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service , from which 385,510 sought exemption . The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec , where anti-war attitudes drawn from French-Canadian nationalism sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1 , 1918 . The disturbances began on a Thursday when Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers . Despite the man 's release , an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held . Rioters then ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City . The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city , which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers .",

The Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin lost its majority , but was able to form a minority government after the elections . The main opposition party , the newly amalgamated Conservative Party of Canada , improved its position but with a showing below its expectations . On May 23 , 2004 , Governor General Adrienne Clarkson , on the advice of Martin , ordered the dissolution of the House of Commons . Following a 36-day campaign , voters elected 308 Members of the House of Commons . All three major national parties had changed their leaders since the 2000 election . Earlier the election was widely expected to be a relatively easy romp for Martin to a fourth consecutive Liberal majority government , but early in 2004 Liberal popularity fell sharply due to the sponsorship scandal . Polls started to indicate the possibility of a minority government for the Liberals , or even a minority Conservative government , fuelling speculation of coalitions with the other parties . In the end , the Liberals fared better than the final opinion polls had led them to fear , but well short of a majority . On election day , polling times were arranged to allow results from most provinces to be announced more or less simultaneously , with the exception of Atlantic Canada , whose results were known before the close of polling in other provinces due to the British Columbia Supreme Court 's decision in R v Bryan .",

  "/wiki/Windsor_Castle": "Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire . It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture . The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe . The castle 's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by early 20th century art historian Hugh Roberts as a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste . Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George 's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic design . Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound . Gradually replaced with stone fortifications , the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons ' War at the start of the 13th century . Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century , and Edward III went further , rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England . Edward 's core design lasted through the Tudor period , during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment . Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired .",

He suffered a heavy defeat in the 1921 election to Mackenzie King and the Liberal Party , but re-entered Parliament through a 1922 by-election and remained as Opposition Leader . In the 1925 election , the Conservatives won a plurality of seats , just eight short of a majority government , but Mackenzie King decided to hold onto power with the support of the Progressives .

  "/wiki/1917_Canadian_federal_election": "The 1917 Canadian federal election ( sometimes referred to as the khaki election ) was held on December 17 , 1917 , to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 13th Parliament of Canada . Described by historian Michael Bliss as the most bitter election in Canadian history , it was fought mainly over the issue of conscription ( see Conscription Crisis of 1917 ) . The election resulted in Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden 's Unionist government elected with a strong majority and the largest percentage of the popular vote for any party in Canadian history . The previous election had been held in 1911 and was won by Borden 's Conservatives . Normally , there is a constitutional requirement that Parliament last no longer than five years , which would have resulted in an election in 1916 . However , citing the emergency of the Great War , the Parliament of Canada approved a one-year extension , which was implemented by the British Parliament . The Borden government hoped that the delay would allow the formation of a coalition government , as existed in Britain . Sir Wilfrid Laurier , head of the Liberal Party of Canada , refused to join the coalition over the issue of conscription , which was strongly opposed in the Liberal heartland of Quebec . Laurier worried that agreeing to Borden 's coalition offer would cause that province to abandon the Liberals and perhaps even Canada . Borden proceeded to form a Unionist government , and the Liberal Party split over the issue . Many English Canadian Liberal MPs and provincial Liberal parties in English Canada supported the new Unionist government . To ensure victory for conscription , Borden introduced two laws to skew the voting towards the government .",
  "/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Canada": "The Progressive Party of Canada was a federal-level political party in Canada in the 1920s until 1930 . It was linked with the provincial United Farmers parties in several provinces , and it spawned the Progressive Party of Saskatchewan , and the Progressive Party of Manitoba , which formed the government of that province . The Progressive Party was part of the farmers ' political movement that included federal and provincial Progressive and United Farmers ' parties . The United Farmers movement in Canada rose to prominence after World War I . With the failure of the wartime Union government to alter a tariff structure that hurt farmers , various farmers movements across Canada became more radical and entered the political arena . The United Farmers movement was tied to the federal Progressive Party of Canada and formed provincial governments in Ontario , Alberta and Manitoba . It rejected the National Policy of the Conservatives , and felt that the Liberals were not strong enough proponents of free trade and were too strongly tied to business interests . Generally , farmers groups formed alliances with Labour and socialist groups though , in power , they became closer to the Liberals causing ruptures in several provinces between United Farmer governments and their organizations .",

Abbott involved himself in politics from a young age , signing the Montreal Annexation Manifesto in 1849 - which he later regretted - and winning election to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1860 . In the lead-up to Confederation he was a prominent advocate for the rights of English-speaking Quebecers . In the 1867 federal election , Abbott was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party .

  "/wiki/Manitoba_Schools_Question": "The Manitoba Schools Question ( French : La question des \u00e9coles du Manitoba ) was a political crisis in the Canadian Province of Manitoba that occurred late in the 19th century , involving publicly funded separate schools for Roman Catholics and Protestants . The crisis eventually spread to the national level , becoming one of the key issues in the federal election of 1896 and resulted in the defeat of the Conservative government , which had been in power for most of the previous thirty years . Because of the close linkage at that time between religion and language , the Schools Question raised the deeper question whether French would survive as a language or a culture in Western Canada . The result of the crisis was that by the end of the 19th century , French was no longer supported as an official language in Manitoba or the neighbouring North-West Territories , which in turn led to a strengthening of French Canadian nationalism in Quebec .",

Clark and his government had been under attack for its perceived inexperience , for example , in its handling of its 1979 election campaign commitment to move Canada 's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . Clark had maintained uneasy relations with the fourth largest party in the House of Commons , Social Credit . While he needed the six votes that the conservative-populist Quebec-based party had to get legislation passed , he was unwilling to agree to the conditions they imposed for their support . Clark had managed to recruit one Social Credit MP , Richard Janelle , to join the PC caucus . Clark 's Minister of Finance , John Crosbie , introduced an austere government budget in late 1979 that proposed to increase the excise tax on gasoline by 18\u00a2 per Imperial gallon ( about 4\u00a2 a litre ) to reduce the federal government 's deficit . The New Democratic Party 's finance critic , Bob Rae , proposed a subamendment to the budget motion , stating that the House of Commons did not approve of the budget . The five remaining Social Credit MPs abstained , upset that the revenues from the increased gas tax were not allocated to Quebec . In addition , one Tory MP was too ill to attend the vote while two others were abroad on official business . Meanwhile , the Liberals assembled all but one member of their caucus , even going as far as to bring in several bedridden MPs by ambulance . Rae 's subamendment was adopted by a vote of 139-133 , bringing down the government and forcing a new election ."
