  "/wiki/Blanding,_UT": "Blanding ( /\u02c8bl\u00e6nd\u026a\u014b/ ( listen ) ) is a city in San Juan County , Utah , United States . The population was 3,375 at the 2010 census , making it the most populated city in San Juan County . It was settled in the late 19th century by Mormon settlers , predominantly from the famed Hole-In-The-Rock expedition . Economic contributors include mineral processing , mining , agriculture , local commerce , tourism , and transportation . Blanding is located near both the Navajo and White Mesa Ute Native American reservations , and a significant percentage of Blanding 's population has family ties to these nearby cultures . Blanding is a gateway to an abundance of nearby natural and archaeological resources , including The Dinosaur Museum , Natural Bridges National Monument , Monument Valley and the Four Corners area , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area ( Lake Powell ) , Cedar Mesa archaeological and wilderness area , the San Juan River including Goosenecks State Park , and the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park . It is located approximately 1 hour south of the popular recreation hub of Moab and Arches National Park .",
  "/wiki/Hovenweep_National_Monument": "Hovenweep National Monument is located on land in southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah , between Cortez , Colorado and Blanding , Utah on the Cajon Mesa of the Great Sage Plain . Shallow tributaries run through the wide and deep canyons into the San Juan River . Although Hovenweep National Monument is largely known for the six groups of Ancestral Puebloan villages , there is evidence of occupation by hunter-gatherers from 8,000 to 6,000 B.C . until about AD 200 . Later , a succession of early puebloan cultures settled in the area and remained until the 14th century . Hovenweep became a National Monument in 1923 and is administered by the National Park Service . In July 2014 , the International Dark-Sky Association designated Hovenweep an International Dark Sky Park .",

  "/wiki/Kivas": "A kiva is a room used by Puebloans for rites and political meetings , many of them associated with the kachina belief system . Among the modern Hopi and most other Pueblo people , kivas are square-walled and underground , and are used for spiritual ceremonies . Similar subterranean rooms are found among ruins in the North-American South-West , indicating uses by the ancient peoples of the region including the ancestral Puebloans , the Mogollon , and the Hohokam . Those used by the ancient Pueblos of the Pueblo I Period and following , designated by the Pecos Classification system developed by archaeologists , were usually round and evolved from simpler pit-houses . For the Ancestral Puebloans , these rooms are believed to have had a variety of functions , including domestic residence along with social and ceremonial purposes .",
  "/wiki/Solar_calendar": "A solar calendar is a calendar whose dates indicate the season or almost equivalently the apparent position of the Sun relative to the stars . The Gregorian calendar , widely accepted as standard in the world , is an example of a solar calendar . The main other type of calendar is a lunar calendar , whose months correspond to cycles of Moon phases . The months of the Gregorian calendar do not correspond to cycles of Moon phase .",
  "/wiki/Solstice": "A solstice is an event occurring when the Sun appears to reach its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere . Two solstices occur annually , around June 21 and December 21 . In many countries , the seasons of the year are determined by reference to the solstices and the equinoxes . The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense , as the day when this occurs . The day of a solstice in either hemisphere has either the most sunlight of the year ( summer solstice ) or the least sunlight of the year ( winter solstice ) for any place other than the Equator . Alternative terms , with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context , are June solstice and December solstice , referring to the months in which they take place every year . The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol ( sun ) and sistere ( to stand still ) , because at the solstices , the Sun 's declination appears to stand still ; that is , the seasonal movement of the Sun 's daily path ( as seen from Earth ) pauses at a northern or southern limit before reversing direction .",
  "/wiki/Equinox": "An equinox is commonly regarded as the instant of time when the plane ( extended indefinitely in all directions ) of Earth 's equator passes through the center of the Sun . This occurs twice each year , around 20 March and 23 September . In other words , it is the moment at which the center of the visible Sun is directly above the equator . The word is derived from the Latin aequinoctium , from aequus ( equal ) and nox ( genitive noctis ) ( night ) . On the day of an equinox , daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet . They are not exactly equal , however , due to the angular size of the Sun , atmospheric refraction , and the rapidly changing duration of the length of day that occurs at most latitudes around the equinoxes . Long before conceiving this equality , primitive equatorial cultures noted the day when the Sun rises due east and sets due west , and indeed this happens on the day closest to the astronomically defined event . In the Northern Hemisphere , the March equinox is called the vernal or spring equinox while the September equinox is called the autumnal or fall equinox . In the Southern Hemisphere , the reverse is true . The dates slightly vary due to leap years and other factors . Since the Moon ( and to a lesser extent the planets ) causes Earth 's orbit to slightly vary from a perfect ellipse , the equinox is officially defined by the Sun 's more regular ecliptic longitude rather than by its declination . The instants of the equinoxes are currently defined to be when the apparent geocentric longitude of the Sun is 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 ."
