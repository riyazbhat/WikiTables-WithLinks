Some sources described Mullah Omar as Head of the Supreme Council of Afghanistan . The Supreme Council was initially established at Kandahar in 1994 .

  "/wiki/Taliban": "The Taliban ( Pashto : \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646 , \u1e6d\u0101lib\u0101n students ) or Taleban , who refer to themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ( IEA ) , are a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement and military organization in Afghanistan currently waging war ( an insurgency , or jihad ) within that country . Since 2016 , the Taliban 's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada . From 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan , and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia , or Islamic law . The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students ( talib ) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools , and fought during the Soviet-Afghan War . Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar , the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan , sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords . The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar . It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks . At its peak , formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban 's government was acknowledged by only three nations : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in the War in Afghanistan . The Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law , which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans , especially women . During their rule from 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians , denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes . According to the United Nations , the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76 % of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010 , 80 % in 2011 , and 80 % in 2012",
