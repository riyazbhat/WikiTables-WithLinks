  "/wiki/Alexander_Ramsey_House": "The Alexander Ramsey House is a historic house museum in Saint Paul , Minnesota , United States ; the former residence of Alexander Ramsey , who served as the first governor of Minnesota Territory and the second governor of the state of Minnesota . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 . It is also a contributing property to the Irvine Park Historic District . It is located at 265 Exchange Street South in the Irvine Park area , which was one of the first trendy neighborhoods in Minnesota . Designed by noted early Minnesota architect Monroe Sheire , the house is one of the nation 's best-preserved Victorian homes , featuring carved walnut woodwork , marble fireplaces , crystal chandeliers , and many original furnishings . The Ramsey family began building the house in 1868 , including innovations like hot water radiators , gas lights and hot and cold running water , and when it was completed in 1872 , the total cost of construction was nearly $ 41,000 . To furnish the house , Ramsey 's wife Anna filled two boxcars with fashionable and expensive Renaissance-revival furniture from the A.T. Stewart Company Store in New York to bring home to Minnesota . The Ramseys ' daughter Marion married Charles Furness in a lavish wedding in the parlor in 1875 . The 15-room house remained in the Ramsey family until the death of Alexander Ramsey 's last surviving granddaughter Anita in 1964 . The house and its contents were left to the Minnesota Historical Society , which now operates it as a museum with tours offered year-round . They offer special programs such as A Victorian Christmas at the Ramsey House in which the house is decorated for the holidays and visitors can discover how the Ramseys would have prepared for and celebrated Christmas . Tours show the dining table set with the family 's china and crystal , with a Christmas tree decorated with the family 's own ornaments .",

As of 2018 , the city 's estimated population was 307,695 . Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County , the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota . The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River , and adjoins Minneapolis , the state 's largest city . Known as the Twin Cities , the two form the core of Minneapolis-Saint Paul , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States , with about 3.6 million residents . Founded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center , the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 . The Dakota name for Saint Paul is Imnizaska . Regionally , the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center , home of the Minnesota Wild , and for the Science Museum of Minnesota . As a business hub of the Upper Midwest , it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab . Saint Paul , along with its twin city , Minneapolis , is known for its high literacy rate . The settlement originally began at present-day Lambert 's Landing , but was known as Pig 's Eye after Pierre Pig 's Eye Parrant established a popular tavern there . When Lucien Galtier , the first Catholic pastor of the region , established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul ( shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul ) , he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name , as Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated , this monosyllable is short , sounds good , it is understood by all Christian denominations .",

A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",

Lindbergh covered the \u200b33 1\u20442-hour , 3,600-statute-mile ( 5,800 km ) flight alone in a purpose-built , single-engine Ryan monoplane , the Spirit of St. Louis . Although not the first non-stop transatlantic flight , this was the first solo transatlantic flight , the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs , and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles , thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement . Lindbergh was an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve , and he received the United States ' highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his transatlantic flight . His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail , which revolutionized the aviation industry , and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity . Lindbergh 's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy . In March 1932 , his infant son , Charles Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the Crime of the Century . The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim . By late 1935 , the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe , from which they returned in 1939 . Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany .

The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 . Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property : contributing and non-contributing . A contributing property , such as a 19th-century mansion , helps make a historic district historic , while a non-contributing property , such as a modern medical clinic , does not .

World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Mississippi_National_River_and_Recreation_Area": "The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area protects a 72-mile ( 116 km ) and 54,000-acre ( 22,000 ha ) corridor along the Mississippi River from the cities of Dayton and Ramsey , Minnesota to just downstream of Hastings , Minnesota . This includes the stretch of Mississippi River which flows through Minneapolis and St. Paul , Minnesota . This stretch of the upper Mississippi River includes natural , historical , recreational , cultural , scenic , scientific , and economic resources of national significance . This is the only national park dedicated exclusively to the Mississippi River . It is located in parts of Anoka , Dakota , Hennepin , Ramsey , and Washington counties , all within the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area . The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is a long name and therefore is frequently referred to as MNRRA ( often pronounced like minnra ) or MISS ( the four letter code assigned to the park by the National Park Service ) . The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area ( MISS ) was established in 1988 as a new unique type of National Park known as a partnership park . Unlike traditional national parks , MISS is not a major land owner and therefore does not have control over land use . MISS works with dozens of partners ( local , state , and federal governments , non-profits , businesses , educational institutions , and individuals ) who own land along the river or who have an interest in the Mississippi River to achieve the National Park Service 's mission to protect and preserve for future generations . Some of the most prominent attractions within the park include the St. Anthony Falls Historic District ( including Mill City Museum , the Guthrie Theater , the Stone Arch Bridge , and Mill Ruins Park ) , the Historic Fort Snelling and the adjacent Fort Snelling State Park , Minnehaha Falls , and the rustic Winchell Trail . There are many additional attractions , trails , and programs all within the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area . As of 2016 MNRRA has two visitor centers , one located inside the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul , MN and the other at Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock & Dam in Minneapolis , both of which are staffed by National Park Rangers .",

  "/wiki/Jeffers_Petroglyphs": "The Jeffers Petroglyphs site is an outcrop in southwestern Minnesota with pre-contact Native American petroglyphs . The petroglyphs are pecked into rock of the Red Rock Ridge , a 23-mile ( 37 km ) -long Sioux quartzite outcrop that extends from Watonwan County , Minnesota to Brown County , Minnesota . The exposed surface is approximately 150 by 650 feet ( 50 by 200 m ) and surrounded by virgin prairie . Several old wagon trail ruts traverse the site , one of which is believed to be the old stage coach route from New Ulm , Minnesota to Sioux Falls , South Dakota . The exact age of the petroglyphs is not known , but the earliest petroglyphs are estimated to be from 9000 to 7000 years ago ( 7000 to 5000 BCE ) . but some atlatl symbols at Jeffers are a close match with similar symbols at Indian Knoll in Kentucky , which have been dated to 3000 BCE during the Late Archaic Period . Another clue to the age comes from the projectile point carvings , which show a projectile point design used by hunters in the Late Archaic Period . Other carvings , such as thunderbirds , dragonflies , turtles , and shamans , are symbolic of later tribes such as the Otoe tribe , Sioux , and Iowa tribe . These are believed to date between 900 CE and 1750 CE . There are over 4000 American Indian images preserved in the bedrock .

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78 % of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",
  "/wiki/Petroglyph": "A petroglyph is an image created by removing part of a rock surface by incising , picking , carving , or abrading , as a form of rock art . Outside North America , scholars often use terms such as carving , engraving , or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images . Petroglyphs are found worldwide , and are often associated with prehistoric peoples . The word comes from the Greek prefix petro- , from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 petra meaning stone , and \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9 gl\u00fdph\u014d meaning carve , and was originally coined in French as p\u00e9troglyphe . Another form of petroglyph , normally found in literate cultures , a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on living rock such as a cliff , rather than a detached piece of stone . While these relief carvings are a category of rock art , sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture , they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art , which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric or nonliterate cultures . Some of these reliefs exploit the rock 's natural properties to define an image . Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures , especially in the ancient Near East . Rock reliefs are generally fairly large , as they need to be to make an impact in the open air . Most have figures that are larger than life-size . Stylistically , a culture 's rock relief carvings relate to other types of sculpture from period concerned . Except for Hittite and Persian examples , they are generally discussed as part of the culture 's sculptural practice .",

Lac qui Parle is a French translation of the native Dakota name , meaning lake which speaks . In the 19th century , the first dictionary of the Dakota language was written , and part of the Bible was translated into that language for the first time at a mission on the site of the park . It was a site for Christian missionary work to the Sioux for nearly 20 years . Renville was related to and had many friends in the native community , and after his death in 1846 , the business was taken over by the irreligious Martin McLeod . The Indians became more hostile to the mission , and in 1854 the missionaries abandoned the site and relocated to the Upper Sioux Agency .

The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state . The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ( Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna ; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end ) , collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena , resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858 . Despite ceding their lands , their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry , which is the cultural center of the Sioux people .

  "/wiki/Sawmill": "A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber . Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces , and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ( dimensional lumber ) . The portable saw mill is iconic and of simple operation - the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed , by the operator manually pushing the saw . The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig ( Alaskan saw mill ) , with similar horizontal operation . Before the invention of the sawmill , boards were made in various manual ways , either rived ( split ) and planed , hewn , or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw , one above and another in a saw pit below . The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill , a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis , Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD . Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , and in the next few centuries , spread across Europe . The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade . Generally , only the saw was powered , and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand . An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage , also water powered , to move the log steadily through the saw blade . By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , the circular saw blade had been invented , and with the development of steam power in the 19th century , a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible . Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler .",
