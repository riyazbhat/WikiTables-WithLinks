  "/wiki/Imamah_(Shi'a_doctrine)": "In Shia Islam , the Imamah ( Arabic : \u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0629 ) is a doctrine which asserts that certain individuals from the lineage of the Prophet Muhammad are to be accepted as leaders and guides of the ummah after the death of the Prophet . Imamah further says that Imams possess divine knowledge and authority ( Ismah ) as well as being part of the Ahl al-Bayt , the family of Muhammad . These Imams have the role of providing commentary and interpretation of the Quran as well as guidance . According to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , the Imam is a means through which humans receive divine grace , because He brings men closer to obedience ( of Allah ) and keeps them away from disobedience . As fulfilling the human being is his wish , it is logical that God appoints Imams to subject man to his wishes . So his existence and his deeds display two forms of grace of God toward man",

The term Twelver refers to its adherents ' belief in twelve divinely ordained leaders , known as the Twelve Imams , and their belief that the last Imam , Imam al-Mahdi , lives in occultation and will reappear as the promised Mahdi . According to Shia tradition , the Mahdi 's tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus , who is to assist the Mahdi against the Dajjal . Twelvers believe that the Twelve Imams are the spiritual and political successors to the Islamic prophet Muhammad . According to the theology of Twelvers , the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice , but are also able to preserve and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran . The words and deeds ( Sunnah ) of Muhammad and the Imams are a guide and model for the community to follow ; as a result , Muhammad and the Imams must be free from error and sin , a doctrine known as Ismah or infallibility , and must be chosen by divine decree , or nass , through Muhammad . Twelver Shiism is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with about 85 % of all Shias , or approximately 150 to 200 million Twelver Shias . Twelvers make majorities among Shia Muslims in Iran , Azerbaijan , Iraq , Lebanon , Bahrain . Also , they make significant minorities in India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia , Bangladesh , Kuwait , Oman , UAE , Qatar , Nigeria , Chad , and Tanzania . Iran is the only country where Twelver Shiism is the state religion . Twelvers share many tenets of Shia with related sects , such as the belief in Imams , but the Ismaili Shias believe in a different number of Imams and , for the most part , a different path of succession regarding the Imamate . They also differ in the role and overall definition of an Imam",

Twelver Shias believe that al-Mahdi was born on the 15th Sha'ban 879 CE/ 255 AH and assumed Imamate at nearly 5 years of age following the killing of his father Hasan al-Askari . In the early years of his Imamah , he is believed to have had contact with his followers only through The Four Deputies .

A few days before the death of his fourth deputy Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri in 941 , he is believed to have sent his followers a letter . In that letter which was transmitted by al-Samarri he declared the beginning of Major Occultation ( Arabic : \u0671\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) , during which Mahdi is not in contact with his followers directly but has instructed them to follow the pious high clerics for whom he has mentioned some distinguishing merits . Sunni Muslims reject that he is the Mahdi and believe that the Mahdi has not yet been born . They believe his exact identity is only known to Allah , other than the idea that he is to be from the descendants of Muhammad . Aside from the Mahdi 's precise genealogy , Sunnis accept many of the same hadiths which Shias accept about the predictions regarding the Mahdi 's emergence , his acts , and his universal Caliphate . Sunnis also have many hadiths about Mahdi which are in their Hadith collections",
