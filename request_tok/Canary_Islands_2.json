  "/wiki/New_Year": "New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar 's year count increments by one . Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner and the 1st day of January is often marked as a national holiday . In the Gregorian calendar , the most widely used calendar system today , New Year occurs on January 1 ( New Year 's Day ) . This was also the first day of the year in the original Julian calendar and of the Roman calendar ( after 153 BC ) . During the Middle Ages in western Europe , while the Julian calendar was still in use , authorities moved New Year 's Day , depending upon locale , to one of several other days , including March 1 , March 25 , Easter , September 1 , and December 25 . Beginning in 1582 , the adoptions of the Gregorian calendar has meant that many national or local dates in the Western World and beyond have changed to using one fixed date for New Year 's Day , January 1 . Other cultures observe their traditional or religious New Years Day according to their own customs , sometimes in addition to a ( Gregorian ) civil calendar . Chinese New Year , the Islamic New Year , the traditional Japanese New Year and the Jewish New Year are the more well-known examples . India and other countries continue to celebrate New Year on different dates",
  "/wiki/Epiphany_(holiday)": "Epiphany ( /\u026a\u02c8p\u026af\u0259ni/ i-PIF-\u0259-nee ) is a Christian feast day that celebrates the revelation ( theophany ) of God incarnate as Jesus Christ . In Western Christianity , the feast commemorates principally ( but not solely ) the visit of the Magi to the Christ Child , and thus Jesus ' physical manifestation to the Gentiles . It is sometimes called Three Kings ' Day , and in some traditions celebrated as Little Christmas . Moreover , the feast of the Epiphany , in some denominations , also initiates the liturgical season of Epiphanytide . Eastern Christians , on the other hand , commemorate the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River , seen as his manifestation to the world as the Son of God . The spot marked by Qasr el Yahud in the West Bank , and Al-Maghtas in Jordan on the east bank , is considered to be the original site of the baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist . The traditional date for the feast is January 6 . However , since 1970 , the celebration is held in some countries on the Sunday after January 1 . Those Eastern Churches which are still following the Julian calendar observe the feast on what , according to the internationally used Gregorian calendar , is January 19 , because of the current 13-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars . In many Western Christian Churches , the eve of the feast is celebrated as Twelfth Night ( Epiphany Eve ) . The Monday after Epiphany is known as Plough Monday . Popular Epiphany customs include Epiphany singing , chalking the door , having one 's house blessed , consuming Three Kings Cake , winter swimming , as well as attending church services",
  "/wiki/Holy_Thursday": "Maundy Thursday ( also known as Holy Thursday , Covenant Thursday , Great and Holy Thursday , Sheer Thursday , and Thursday of Mysteries , among other names ) is the Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter . It commemorates the Washing of the Feet ( Maundy ) and Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Apostles , as described in the canonical gospels . It is the fifth day of Holy Week , preceded by Holy Wednesday ( Spy Wednesday ) and followed by Good Friday . Maundy comes from the Latin word mandatum , or commandment , reflecting Jesus ' words I give you a new commandment . The day comes always between March 19 and April 22 , inclusive , and will vary according to whether the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar is used . Eastern churches generally use the Julian system . Maundy Thursday initiates the Easter Triduum , the period which commemorates the passion , death , and resurrection of Jesus ; this period includes Good Friday and Holy Saturday , and ends on the evening of Easter . The Mass of the Lord 's Supper or service of worship is normally celebrated in the evening , when Friday begins according to Jewish tradition , as the Last Supper was held on the feast of Passover , according to the three Synoptic Gospels",
  "/wiki/Holy_Friday": "Good Friday is a Christian holiday recalling the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary . It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday , and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover . It is also known as Holy Friday , Great Friday , and Black Friday . Members of many Christian denominations , including the Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Lutheran , Anglican , Methodist , Oriental Orthodox and Reformed traditions , observe Good Friday with fasting and church services . The date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next on both the Gregorian and Julian calendars . Eastern and Western Christianity disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday . Good Friday is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world , including in most Western countries and 12 U.S. states . Some countries , such as Germany , have laws prohibiting certain acts , such as dancing and horse racing , that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day",

  "/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary": "The Assumption of Mary into Heaven ( often shortened to the Assumption ) is , according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church , Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life . In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) . Various apocryphal documents do contain narrations of the event",

  "/wiki/Discovery_of_the_Americas": "The settlement of the Americas began when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers entered North America from the North Asian Mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge , which had formed between northeastern Siberia and western Alaska due to the lowering of sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum . These populations expanded south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and spread rapidly throughout both North and South America , by 14,000 years ago . The earliest populations in the Americas , before roughly 10,000 years ago , are known as Paleo-Indians . The peopling of the Americas is a long-standing open question , and while advances in archaeology , Pleistocene geology , physical anthropology , and DNA analysis have shed progressively more light on the subject , significant questions remain unresolved . While there is general agreement that the Americas were first settled from Asia , the pattern of migration , its timing , and the place ( s ) of origin in Eurasia of the peoples who migrated to the Americas remain unclear . The prevalent migration models outline different time frames for the Asian migration from the Bering Straits and subsequent dispersal of the founding population throughout the continent . Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to Siberian populations by linguistic factors , the distribution of blood types , and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data , such as DNA . The Clovis first theory refers to the 1950s hypothesis that the Clovis culture represents the earliest human presence in the Americas , beginning about 13,000 years ago ; evidence of pre-Clovis cultures has accumulated since 2000 , pushing back the possible date of the first peopling of the Americas to about 13,200-15,500 years ago",
  "/wiki/All_Saints'_Day": "All Saints ' Day , also known as All Hallows ' Day , Hallowmas , the Feast of All Saints , or Solemnity of All Saints , is a Christian festival celebrated in honour of all the saints , known and unknown .

The Eastern Orthodox Church and associated Eastern Catholic Churches and Byzantine Lutheran Churches celebrate it on the first Sunday after Pentecost . Oriental Orthodox churches of Chaldea and associated Eastern Catholic churches celebrate All Saints ' Day on the first Friday after Easter . In the Western Christian practice , the liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October , All Hallows ' Eve ( All Saints ' Eve ) , and ends at the close of 1 November . It is thus the day before All Souls ' Day , which commemorates the faithful departed . In many traditions , All Saints ' Day is part of the season of Allhallowtide , which includes the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive and in some denominations , such as Anglicanism , extends to Remembrance Sunday . In places where All Saints ' Day is observed as a public holiday but All Souls ' Day is not , cemetery and grave rituals such as offerings of flowers , candles and prayers or blessings for the graves of loved ones often take place on All Saints Day . In Austria and Germany , godparents gift their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel ( All Saint 's Braid ) on All Saint 's Day , while the practice of souling remains popular in Portugal . It is a national holiday in many Christian countries . The Christian celebration of All Saints ' Day and All Souls ' Day stems from a belief that there is a powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven ( the Church triumphant ) , and the living ( the Church militant ) . In Catholic theology , the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven",

  "/wiki/Immaculate_Conception": "In Roman Catholic Christian theology , the Immaculate Conception is the conception of the Virgin Mary free from original sin by virtue of the merits of her son Jesus . The Catholic Church teaches that God acted upon Mary in the first moment of her conception , keeping her immaculate . Other Christian denominations have a range of views on the matter . The Immaculate Conception is commonly confused with the virgin birth of Jesus , the latter saying that Jesus was conceived and born by his mother Mary without a human father . While many Christians believe in the virgin birth of Jesus , it is principally Roman Catholics who believe in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception . Although the belief that Mary was sinless , or conceived without original sin , has been widely held since Late Antiquity , the doctrine was not dogmatically defined in the Catholic Church until 1854 when Pope Pius IX , declared ex cathedra , i.e. , using papal infallibility , in his papal bull Ineffabilis Deus , the Immaculate Conception to be doctrine . The Catholic Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 ; in many Catholic countries , it is a holy day of obligation or patronal feast , and in some a national public holiday",
  "/wiki/Christmas": "Christmas ( or Feast of the Nativity ) is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed primarily on December 25 [ a ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions , Christmastide includes an octave . Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world 's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians , as well as culturally by many non-Christians , and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it . The traditional Christmas narrative , the Nativity of Jesus , delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies . When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city , the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born , with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information . Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25 . This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar . Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar . For Christians , believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than knowing Jesus ' exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian , and secular themes and origins . Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving ; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath ; Christmas music and caroling ; viewing a Nativity play ; an exchange of Christmas cards ; church services ; a special meal ; and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly",
  "/wiki/Jesus_of_Nazareth": "Jesus [ e ] ( c. 4 BC - c. AD 30 / 33 ) , also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ , [ f ] was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader . He is the central figure of Christianity . Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah ( the Christ ) prophesied in the Old Testament . Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , [ g ] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus . [ h ] [ i ] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry . He preached orally and was often referred to as rabbi . Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God , engaged in healings , taught in parables and gathered followers . He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , turned over to the Roman government , and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect . After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the early Church . Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Christian Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , from where he will return . Most Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God . The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection , an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology"
