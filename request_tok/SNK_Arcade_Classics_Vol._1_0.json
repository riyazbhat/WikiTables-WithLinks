  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter",

  "/wiki/Sports_game": "A sports game is a video game genre that simulates the practice of sports . Most sports have been recreated with a game , including team sports , track and field , extreme sports and combat sports . Some games emphasize actually playing the sport ( such as the Madden NFL series ) , whilst others emphasize strategy and sport management ( such as Championship Manager and Out of the Park Baseball ) . Some , such as Need for Speed , Arch Rivals and Punch-Out ! ! , satirize the sport for comic effect . This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive , just like real-world sports .

  "/wiki/Beat_'em_up": "Beat 'em up ( also known as brawler ) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents . Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling , two-dimensional ( 2D ) levels , though some later games feature more open three-dimensional ( 3D ) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies . These games are noted for their simple gameplay , a source of both critical acclaim and derision . Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre . Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots , though some games may employ historical , science fiction or fantasy themes . The first beat 'em up was 1984 's Kung-Fu Master , with 1986 's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games . The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987 , which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups , and led to 1991 's Street Fighter II , which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games . Games such as Streets of Rage , Final Fight , Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period . The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games , but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments . In recent years , the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia , with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online ( 2004 )",

  "/wiki/Shoot_'em_up": "Shoot 'em up ( also known as shmup or STG ) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up . Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement ; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives . The genre 's roots can be traced back to Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games , developed in 1962 . The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan .

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers",
