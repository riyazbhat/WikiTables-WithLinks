The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes , followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC , when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum . It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire . The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918 , when Bavaria became a republic . In 1946 , the Free State of Bavaria reorganized itself on democratic lines after the Second World War . Bavaria has a unique culture , largely because of the state 's former Catholic majority and conservative traditions",

Thuringia is located in central Germany covering an area of 16,171 square kilometres ( 6,244 sq mi ) and a population of 2.15 million inhabitants , making it the sixth smallest German state by area and the fifth smallest by population . Erfurt is the state capital and largest city , while other major cities include Jena , Gera , and Weimar . Thuringia is surrounded by the states of Bavaria , Hesse , Lower Saxony , Saxony-Anhalt , and Saxony . Most of Thuringia is within the watershed of the Saale , a left tributary of the Elbe , and has been known as the green heart of Germany ( das gr\u00fcne Herz Deutschlands ) from the late 19th century due to the dense forest covering the land . Thuringia is home to the Rennsteig , Germany 's best-known hiking trail , and the winter resort of Oberhof , making it a well-known winter sports destination with half of Germany 's 136 Winter Olympic gold medals won through 2014 having been won by Thuringian athletes . Thuringia is also home to prominent German intellectuals and creative artists , including Johann Sebastian Bach , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , and Friedrich Schiller , and is location of the University of Jena , the Ilmenau University of Technology , the University of Erfurt , and the Bauhaus University of Weimar . Thuringia was established in 1920 as a state of the Weimar Republic from a merger of the Ernestine duchies , except for Saxe-Coburg , but can trace its origins to the Frankish Duchy of Thuringia established around 631 AD by King Dagobert I . After World War II , Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone in Allied-occupied Germany , and its borders altered to become contiguous . Thuringia became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949 , but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms , and its territory divided into the districts of Erfurt , Suhl and Gera . Thuringia was re-established in 1990 following German reunification , with slightly different borders , and became one of the Federal Republic of Germany 's new states",
