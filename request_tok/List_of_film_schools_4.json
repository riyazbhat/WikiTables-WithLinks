  "/wiki/Private_school": "An independent school is independent in its finances and governance . Also known as private schools , non-governmental , privately funded , or non-state schools , they are not administered by local , state or national governments . They are usually not dependent upon national or local government to finance their financial endowment . They are typically governed by a board of governors which is elected independently of government , and has a system of governance that ensures its independent operation . Children who attend private schools may be there because they are dissatisfied with public schools in their area . They may be selected for their academic prowess , or prowess in other fields , or sometimes their religious background . Private schools retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students for tuition , rather than relying on taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , lowering this tuition fee , dependent on a student 's talents or abilities ( e.g . sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , need for financial aid , or tax credit scholarships that might be available . Some private schools are associated with a particular religion , such as Judaism , Roman Catholicism , or Lutheranism . For the past century , roughly one in 10 U.S. families has chosen to enroll their children in private school . Independent schools may have a religious affiliation , but the precise usage of the term excludes parochial ( and other ) schools if there is a financial dependence upon , or governance subordinate to , outside organizations . These definitions generally apply equally to both primary and secondary education .",

Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",

Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order , with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia . It is the political , economic , administrative and industrial center of the country . Bogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on August 6 , 1538 , by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca . The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region , and they called the place of the foundation Thybzaca or Old Town . The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca Bacat\u00e1 ( or Mueket\u00e1 ) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota . There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1 , the most accepted being that it means walling of the farmland in the Chibcha language . Another popular translation argues that it means The Lady of the Andes . Further , the word 'Andes ' in the Aymara language means shining mountain , thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as The Lady of the shining mountain ( notice , however , that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha ) . Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived . Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of Our Lady of Hope but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 ( Holy Faith ) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city . Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada ( created in 1550 ) , and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada .",
