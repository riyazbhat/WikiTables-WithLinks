  "/wiki/Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park": "Lassen Volcanic National Park is an American national park in northeastern California . The dominant feature of the park is Lassen Peak , the largest plug dome volcano in the world and the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range . Lassen Volcanic National Park started as two separate national monuments designated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 : Cinder Cone National Monument and Lassen Peak National Monument . The source of heat for the volcanism in the Lassen area is subduction of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate off the Northern California coast . The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots , fumaroles , and hot springs . Lassen Volcanic National Park is one of the few areas in the world where all four types of volcano can be found - plug dome , shield , cinder cone , and stratovolcano . The park is accessible via State Routes 89 and 44 . SR 89 passes north-south through the park , beginning at SR 36 to the south and ending at SR 44 to the north . SR 89 passes immediately adjacent to the base of Lassen Peak . There are five vehicle entrances to the park : the north and south entrances on SR 89 ; and unpaved roads entering at Drakesbad and Juniper Lake in the south , and at Butte Lake in the northeast . The park can also be accessed by trails leading in from the Caribou Wilderness to the east , as well as the Pacific Crest Trail , and two smaller trails leading in from Willow Lake and Little Willow Lake to the south . The Lassen Chalet , a large lodge with concession facilities , was located near the southwest entrance , but was demolished in 2005 .",

  "/wiki/Loomis_Visitor_Center,_Bldg._43": "The Loomis Museum , also known as the Loomis Visitor Center , the Manzanita Lake Visitor Center and the Manzanita Lake Museum , was built by Benjamin Franklin Loomis in 1927 near Manzanita Lake , just outside Lassen Volcanic National Park in California , USA . Loomis was a local homesteader and photographer who documented the 1915 eruptions of Lassen Peak , and was instrumental in the 1916 establishment of the national park . In 1929 Loomis donated the museum and 40 acres ( 16 ha ) of surrounding lands to the National Park Service , which since then has used the structure as an interpretational facility . Loomis had desired that the headquarters of the new park be established at Manzanita Lake , but an alternate site was chosen by the Park Service . Loomis and his wife Estella started building their own museum to exhibit photographs taken by Loomis and others , as well as geological exhibits and artifacts of local Native Americans . The building was dedicated on July 4 , 1927 as the Mae Loomis Memorial Museum , named after their only child , Luisa Mae Loomis , who had died in 1920 .",
  "/wiki/Manzanita_Lake": "Manzanita Lake is a lake located in Lassen Volcanic National Park . Located near the park entrance , the lake is open for fishing and has rainbow , brown and brook trout . Manzanita Lake was formed when Manzanita Creek was dammed 300 years ago by a rock avalanche from the northwest slope of the Chaos Crags , which also resulted in the debris formation known as Chaos Jumbles . The area around the lake features the Loomis Museum , a campground , and the Manzanita Lake Naturalist 's Services Historic District .",
  "/wiki/Manzanita_Lake_Naturalist's_Services_Historic_District": "The Manzanita Lake Naturalist 's Services Historic District encompasses the historic area devoted to visitor interpretation services at the northwest entrance of Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California . The district 's earliest structures were built by Benjamin and Estella Loomis , who were instrumental in the establishment of the park and among the park 's first concessioners . The 1927 Loomis Museum and its seismograph hut were built by the Loomises and were donated , together with 40 acres ( 16 ha ) of land to the National Park Service in 1929 . The Loomis House , also known as the Loomis Art House and Manzanita Lake Ranger Station , was built about the same time as the museum and served as their residence , photography studio and shop until the 1950s under the name B.F. Loomis Photo and Art Store . Park Service structures were developed at Manzanita Lake in the 1930s . Park Service-designed and constructed buildings include the entrance station ( 1930 ) , the ranger residence ( 1931 ) and the comfort station ( 1931 ) . The naturalist 's residence ( 1933 ) shares a similar design to its counterparts at Crater Lake National Park , with their design and construction techniques adapted to the short building seasons prevalent at both parks . The residence was built using Civilian Conservation Corps labor . The area was abandoned in 1973 after a geological report indicated that a rockfall in the Chaos Crags could reach the Manzanita Lake area in 90 seconds . The Manzanita Lodge and cabins were therefore closed and demolished . In 1987 a reassessment indicated that such a rockfall could not reach Manzanita Lake and the area was reoccupied and renovated . The lodge was never rebuilt .",

  "/wiki/Park_Headquarters,_Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park": "The Headquarters Building at Lassen Volcanic National Park was built in 1928 in an adapted National Park Service Rustic style . The building served not only as the administration building but as a visitor center , and it quickly became too small for the developing park 's needs . It was remodeled three times during its first eleven years . In 1932 , the west wing was expanded with an addition that included men 's and women 's bathrooms and an enlargement to the superintendent 's office . A back porch was added in 1935 to protect the doorways and windows from snow and to provide storage space for furnace wood . The park 's Developmental Outline for 1938 states that due to development in the park , the building was not large enough , adding [ m ] oreover , the present building does not have sufficient storage space , is hard to keep warm in winter , and presents a bleak and unattractive aspect on the outside which gives all park visitors coming by the Headquarters Area a very bad first impression of the park . The park proposed moving the present building elsewhere on the site and converting it to housing , and building a new Administration and Visitor Center Building . Funding was not available for a new building so from 1939 through 1940 the building received a major renovation with the addition of an east wing , which also included an addition to the basement . This work was done according to drawings LV-NP 3004 C & D , designed by G. W. Norgard of the Branch of Plans and Designs , and was a Civilian Conservation Corps construction project . At that time , an engineer 's office was added to the second floor , the stairs were reconfigured , a clerk 's office was added to the first floor and the Assistant Superintendent 's office was expanded . The new east wing had a wood shingled dormer on the south side , and a similar dormer was added to the west wing and the eave extended . The front entrance porch in the north wing was enclosed to expand the lobby and a new stone porch was added to its east side .",

It is the only such building known to have been built in this manner in the western regions of the National Park Service system . The interlocking boards extend past each other at the corners , forming a decorative detail . The ranger station was one of the first three building to be constructed in the park by the Park Service after the park 's 1916 establishment . The other two buildings were the Summit Lake Ranger Station , also listed on the National Register of Historic Places , and the now-demolished Butte Lake Ranger Station ."
