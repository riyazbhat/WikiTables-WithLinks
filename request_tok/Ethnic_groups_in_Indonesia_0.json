Many came initially as sojourners ( temporary residents ) , intending to return home in their old age . Some , however , stayed in the region as economic migrants . Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in southern China . Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians has occurred since the start of Dutch colonialism in the region , although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this . Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as Native Indonesian merchants felt they could not remain competitive .

Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis severely disrupted their business activities , reform of government policy and legislation removed a number of political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians .

These locations are today part of the nations of Malaysia ( Malay nation state ) , Brunei , Singapore , Indonesia and Southern Thailand . There is considerable genetic , linguistic , cultural , artistic , and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups , mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within Maritime Southeast Asia . Historically , the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier Malayic-speaking Austronesians and Austroasiatic tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms , notably Brunei , Kedah , Langkasuka , Gangga Negara , Chi Tu , Nakhon Si Thammarat , Pahang , Melayu and Srivijaya . The advent of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history , the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy . Common definitive markers of a Malayness - the religion of Islam , the Malay language and traditions - are thought to have been promulgated during this era , resulting in the ethnogenesis of the Malay as a major ethnoreligious group in the region . In literature , architecture , culinary traditions , traditional dress , performing arts , martial arts , and royal court traditions , Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated . The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants , particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak , Dayak , Orang Asli and the Orang Laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation . Today , some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia , termed as anak dagang ( traders ) and who predominantly consist of Banjar , Bugis , Minangkabau people and Acehnese peoples , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries . Throughout their history , the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics . They absorbed , shared and transmitted numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups , such as those of Minang , Acehnese , and to some degree Javanese culture ; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture . Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related Betawi , Banjar , Cape Malay , Cocos Malays and Sri Lankan Malay cultures , as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like Ambonese Malay , Baba Malay , the Betawi language and Manado Malay",
