The city was founded in 1847 by followers of the church , led by Brigham Young , who were seeking to escape persecution that they had experienced while living farther east . The Mormon pioneers , as they would come to be known , entered an arid valley and immediately began building , planning , and extending an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth . Salt Lake City 's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan , with the Salt Lake Temple at the origin . Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake , the city was named Great Salt Lake City . In 1868 , the 17th Utah Territorial Legislature dropped the word Great from the city 's name . Immigration of international members of the church , mining booms , and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad initially brought economic growth , and the city was nicknamed the Crossroads of the West . It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway , the first transcontinental highway , in 1913 .",
