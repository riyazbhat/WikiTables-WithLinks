It was named after Nezahualcoyotl , the Acolhua poet and king of nearby Texcoco , and was built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco .

However , public services such as adequate potable water , electricity and sewerage were lacking until after the area was made an independent municipality in 1963 . Today Ciudad Neza is a sprawling city of over one million entirely with modern buildings .
