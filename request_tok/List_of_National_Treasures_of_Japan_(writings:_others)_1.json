This era represents the first half of the Empire of Japan , during which period the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonisation by European powers to the new paradigm of a modern , industrialised nation state and emergent great power , influenced by Western scientific , technological , philosophical , political , legal , and aesthetic ideas . As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas , the changes to Japan were profound , and affected its social structure , internal politics , economy , military , and foreign relations . The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji and was succeeded upon the accession of Emperor Taish\u014d by the Taish\u014d era .",

  "/wiki/Confucianism": "Confucianism , also known as Ruism , is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China . Variously described as tradition , a philosophy , a religion , a humanistic or rationalistic religion , a way of governing , or simply a way of life , Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius ( 551-479 BCE ) . Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang ( c. 1600-1046 BCE ) and Zhou dynasties ( c. 1046-256 BCE ) for the Warring States period . Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BCE ) , but survived . During the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE-220 CE ) , Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang-Lao as the official ideology , while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism . A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) . In the late Tang , Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty ( 960-1297 ) . The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism . The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China 's weaknesses . They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings ; some of these new ideologies include the Three Principles of the People with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People 's Republic of China . In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy .",
  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism ( /\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/ , /\u02c8da\u028a-/ ) , or Taoism ( /\u02c8ta\u028a-/ ) , is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao ( Chinese : \u9053 ; pinyin : D\u00e0o ; literally : 'the Way ' , also romanized as Tao ) . The Dao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools ; in Daoism , however , it denotes the principle that is the source , pattern and substance of everything that exists . Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order , but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao . Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school , but in general tend to emphasise wu wei ( action without intention ) , naturalness , simplicity , spontaneity , and the Three Treasures : \u6148 compassion , \u5109 frugality , and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility . The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE . Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang ( Naturalists ) , and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture , the I Ching ( Yi Jing ) , which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature . The Legalist Shen Buhai ( c. 400 - c. 337 BCE ) may also have been a major influence , expounding a realpolitik of wu wei . The Dao De Jing , a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi ( \u8001\u5b50 ; L\u01ceoz\u01d0 ; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3 ) , is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition , together with the later writings of Zhuangzi . Daoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries , and Daoists ( \u9053\u58eb ; d\u00e0oshi , masters of the Dao ) , a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers , usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders , which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Daoism . Chinese alchemy ( especially neidan ) , Chinese astrology , Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , several martial arts , traditional Chinese medicine , feng shui , and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Daoism throughout history . Beyond China , Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia . Today , the Daoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognised in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) as well as the Republic of China ( ROC ) , and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots , [ citation needed ] it claims adherents in a number of societies , in particular in Hong Kong , Macau , and in Southeast Asia .",
  "/wiki/Buddhism": "Buddhism ( /\u02c8b\u028ad\u026az\u0259m/ , US : /\u02c8bu\u02d0d-/ ) is the world 's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers , or over 7% of the global population , known as Buddhists . [ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia . Vajrayana , a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts , may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism .

Sutras are a genre of ancient and medieval Indian texts found in Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism . In Hinduism , sutras are a distinct type of literary composition , a compilation of short aphoristic statements . Each sutra is any short rule , like a theorem distilled into few words or syllables , around which teachings of ritual , philosophy , grammar , or any field of knowledge can be woven . The oldest sutras of Hinduism are found in the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas . Every school of Hindu philosophy , Vedic guides for rites of passage , various fields of arts , law , and social ethics developed respective sutras , which help teach and transmit ideas from one generation to the next . In Buddhism , sutras , also known as suttas , are canonical scriptures , many of which are regarded as records of the oral teachings of Gautama Buddha . They are not aphoristic , but are quite detailed , sometimes with repetition . This may reflect a philological root of sukta ( well spoken ) , rather than sutra ( thread ) .
