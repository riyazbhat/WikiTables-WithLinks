In Friendship provided material and legal assistance to those being evicted from their tenant farms and households in Clarendon County , Yazoo and other places . King had feelings of betrayal toward Rustin 's open comments about his concern for the timing and possible upbringing of violence in the Poor People 's Campaign of 1968 . After Kings assassination , Rustin agreed to fly from Memphis to help lead the campaign in Kings absence . Rustin faced opposition by movement leadership regarding his involvement , eventually causing him to withdraw his agreement . After the passage of the civil rights legislation of 1964-65 , Rustin became the head of the AFL-CIO 's A. Philip Randolph Institute , which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans .

  "/wiki/Serial_killer": "A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers . For example , while most authorities set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines serial killing as a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone . Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race . A serial killer is neither a mass murderer , nor a spree killer , although there may be conceptual overlaps between serial killers and spree killers .",

On March 8 , 1995 , the United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/83 stated that persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service . This was re-affirmed in 1998 , when resolution 1998/77 recognized that persons [ already ] performing military service may develop conscientious objections . A number of organizations around the world celebrate the principle on May 15 as International Conscientious Objection Day . The term has also been extended to objecting to working for the military-industrial complex due to a crisis of conscience .",

Starring Al Pacino , John Cazale , James Broderick , and Charles Durning , it chronicles the events following a bank robbery committed by Sonny Wortzik ( Pacino ) and Salvatore Naturale ( Cazale ) . Inspired by a LIFE magazine article The Boys in the Bank by P. F. Kluge , Dog Day Afternoon is largely a dramatization of the 1972 bank robbery masterminded by John Wojtowicz .

Dog Day Afternoon is notable for its anti-establishment tone , and marks the third collaboration between Pacino and Cazale , after The Godfather . It is the final film released in Cazale 's lifetime ( The Deer Hunter was released after his death ) , and its title refers to the sultry dog days of summer . The film contains no musical score , bar the appearance of three diegetic songs . The majority of Dog Day Afternoon was shot on location in Windsor Terrace , Brooklyn ; near the site of the actual bank robbery . Although the film follows the basic text of the script as written by Pierson , Lumet encouraged the actors to improvise and workshop scenes to facilitate naturalistic dialogue . Dog Day Afternoon was released in the United States on September 21 , 1975 , and received universal acclaim for the performances of its cast , its directing , and its screenplay . It retrospectively saw praise for its approach to transgenderism and bisexuality .

The author of several influential books , most notably Character Analysis ( 1933 ) , The Mass Psychology of Fascism ( 1933 ) , and The Sexual Revolution ( 1936 ) , Reich became known as one of the most radical figures in the history of psychiatry . [ n 1 ] Reich 's work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud 's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence ( 1936 ) , and his idea of muscular armour - the expression of the personality in the way the body moves - shaped innovations such as body psychotherapy , Gestalt therapy , bioenergetic analysis and primal therapy . His writing influenced generations of intellectuals ; he coined the phrase the sexual revolution and according to one historian acted as its midwife . During the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and Berlin , students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of The Mass Psychology of Fascism at police . After graduating in medicine from the University of Vienna in 1922 , Reich became deputy director of Freud 's outpatient clinic , the Vienna Ambulatorium . Described by Elizabeth Danto as a large man with a cantankerous style who managed to look scruffy and elegant at the same time , he tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with Marxism , arguing that neurosis is rooted in sexual and socio-economic conditions , and in particular in a lack of what he called orgastic potency . He visited patients in their homes to see how they lived , and took to the streets in a mobile clinic , promoting adolescent sexuality and the availability of contraceptives , abortion and divorce , a provocative message in Catholic Austria . He said he wanted to attack the neurosis by its prevention rather than treatment . From the 1930s he became an increasingly controversial figure , and from 1932 until his death in 1957 all his work was self-published . His message of sexual liberation disturbed the psychoanalytic community and his political associates , and his vegetotherapy , in which he massaged his disrobed patients to dissolve their muscular armour , violated the key taboos of psychoanalysis . He moved to New York in 1939 , in part to escape the Nazis , and shortly after arriving coined the term orgone - from orgasm and organism - for a biological energy he said he had discovered , which he said others called God .",
  "/wiki/Psychoanalyst": "Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind , which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders .

Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions , mostly by students of Freud such as Alfred Adler and his collaborator , Carl Gustav Jung , [ a ] and by neo-Freudians such as Erich Fromm , Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan . Freud retained the term psychoanalysis for his own school of thought . Psychoanalysis is a controversial discipline and its validity as a science is contested . Nonetheless , it remains a strong influence within psychiatry , more so in some quarters than others . [ b ] [ c ] The proportion of practitioners of Freudian psychoanalysis has declined as evidence-based medicine has increased the use of cognitive behavioral therapy .

  "/wiki/Contempt_of_court": "Contempt of court , often referred to simply as contempt , is the offense of being disobedient to or disrespectful toward a court of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority , justice and dignity of the court . A similar attitude towards a legislative body is termed contempt of Parliament or contempt of Congress . There are broadly two categories of contempt : being disrespectful to legal authorities in the courtroom , or willfully failing to obey a court order . Contempt proceedings are especially used to enforce equitable remedies , such as injunctions . In some jurisdictions , the refusal to respond to subpoena , to testify , to fulfill the obligations of a juror , or to provide certain information can constitute contempt of the court . When a court decides that an action constitutes contempt of court , it can issue an order that in the context of a court trial or hearing declares a person or organization to have disobeyed or been disrespectful of the court 's authority , called found or held in contempt . That is the judge 's strongest power to impose sanctions for acts that disrupt the court 's normal process . A finding of being in contempt of court may result from a failure to obey a lawful order of a court , showing disrespect for the judge , disruption of the proceedings through poor behavior , or publication of material or non-disclosure of material , which in doing so is deemed likely to jeopardize a fair trial . A judge may impose sanctions such as a fine or jail for someone found guilty of contempt of court , which makes contempt of court a process crime .

The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion .",

  "/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building , located in Washington , D.C .",
