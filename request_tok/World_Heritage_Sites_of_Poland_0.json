  "/wiki/Krak\u00f3w_Old_Town": "Krak\u00f3w Old Town is the historic central district of Krak\u00f3w , Poland . It is one of the most famous old districts in Poland today and was the center of Poland 's political life from 1038 until King Sigismund III Vasa relocated his court to Warsaw in 1596 . The entire medieval old town is among the first sites chosen for the UNESCO 's original World Heritage List , inscribed as Cracow 's Historic Centre . The old town is also one of Poland 's official national Historic Monuments ( Pomnik historii ) chosen in the first round , as designated September 16 , 1994 , and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland . The Old Town is known in Polish as Stare Miasto . It is part of the city 's first administrative district which is also named Stare Miasto , although it covers a wider area than the Old Town itself . Medieval Krak\u00f3w was surrounded by a 1.9 mile ( 3 km ) defensive wall complete with 46 towers and seven main entrances leading through them . The fortifications around the Old Town were erected over the course of two centuries . The current architectural plan of Stare Miasto - the 13th-century merchants ' town - was drawn up in 1257 after the destruction of the city during the Tatar invasions of 1241 followed by raids of 1259 and repelled in 1287 . The district features the centrally located Rynek G\u0142\u00f3wny , or Main Square , the largest medieval town square of any European city . There is a number of historic landmarks in its vicinity , such as St. Mary 's Basilica ( Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Mariacki ) , Church of St. Wojciech ( St. Adalbert 's ) , Church of St. Barbara , as well as other national treasures . At the center of the plaza , surrounded by kamienice ( row houses ) and noble residences , stands the Renaissance cloth hall Sukiennice ( currently housing gift shops , restaurants and merchant stalls ) with the National Gallery of Art upstairs",

Situated on the Vistula River in Lesser Poland Province , the city dates back to the 7th century . Krak\u00f3w was the official capital of Poland until 1596 and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic , economic , cultural and artistic life . Cited as one of Europe 's most beautiful cities , its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland 's second most important city . It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Central Europe in 965 . With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Krak\u00f3w reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre . The city has a population of about 770,000 , with approximately 8 million additional people living within a 100 km ( 62 mi ) radius of its main square . After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany at the start of World War II , the newly defined Distrikt Krakau ( Krak\u00f3w District ) became the capital of Germany 's General Government . The Jewish population of the city was forced into a walled zone known as the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto , from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return , and the Nazi concentration camps like P\u0142asz\u00f3w . However , the city was spared from destruction and major bombing . In 1978 , Karol Wojty\u0142a , archbishop of Krak\u00f3w , was elevated to the papacy as Pope John Paul II - the first ever Slavic pope , and the first non-Italian pope in 455 years",

Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791",

Sigismund was the son of John III of Sweden and his first wife , Catherine Jagiellon of Poland . Elected to the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , he sought to create a personal union between the Commonwealth and Sweden ( Polish-Swedish union ) , and succeeded for a time in 1592 . After he had been deposed in 1599 from the Swedish throne by his Protestant uncle , Charles IX of Sweden , and a meeting of the Riksens st\u00e4nder , he spent much of the rest of his life attempting to reclaim it . A pious yet erratic ruler , Sigismund attempted to hold absolute power in all his dominions . Shortly after his victory over internal opposition , Sigismund took advantage of a period of civil unrest in Muscovy , known as the Time of Troubles , and invaded Russia , holding Moscow for two years ( 1610-12 ) and Smolensk thereafter . In 1617 the Polish-Swedish conflict , which had been interrupted by an armistice in 1611 , broke out again . While Sigismund 's army was also fighting Ottoman forces in Moldavia ( 1617-21 ) , King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden invaded Sigismund 's lands , capturing Riga in 1621 and seizing almost all of Polish Livonia . Sigismund , who concluded the Truce of Altmark with Sweden in 1629 , never regained the Swedish crown . His Swedish wars resulted , moreover , in Poland 's loss of northern Livonian territories and in a diminution of the kingdom 's international prestige . Sigismund remains a highly controversial figure in Poland",

With a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents , Warsaw is the 5th most-populous urban area in the European Union . The city limits cover 517.24 square kilometres ( 199.71 sq mi ) , while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres ( 2,355.39 sq mi ) . Warsaw is an alpha global city , a major international tourist destination , and a significant cultural , political and economic hub . Its historical old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Once described as the Paris of the North , Warsaw was believed to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world until World War II . Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939 , the city withstood a siege for which it was later awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari . Deportations of the Jewish population to concentration camps led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the destruction of the Ghetto after a month of combat . A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive . Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its extensive history and complete reconstruction after World War II , which had left over 85 % of its buildings in ruins . Warsaw is one of Europe 's most dynamic metropolitan cities",

The Wieliczka salt mine , excavated from the 13th century , produced table salt continuously until 2007 , as one of the world 's oldest operating salt mines . Throughout its history , the royal salt mine was operated by the \u017bupy Krakowskie ( Krak\u00f3w Salt Mines ) company . Due to falling salt prices and mine flooding , commercial salt mining was discontinued in 1996 . The Wieliczka Salt Mine is now an official Polish Historic Monument ( Pomnik Historii ) .

  "/wiki/Metropolitan_area": "A metropolitan area is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories , sharing industry , infrastructure , and housing . A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities : neighborhoods , townships , boroughs , cities , towns , exurbs , suburbs , counties , districts , states , and even nations like the eurodistricts . As social , economic and political institutions have changed , metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions . Metropolitan areas include satellite cities , towns and intervening rural areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban core , typically measured by commuting patterns . Most metropolitan areas are anchored by one major city such as Paris metropolitan area ( Paris ) and New York metropolitan area ( New York City ) . In some cases metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance , such as Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area ( Dallas and Fort Worth ) and Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area ( Islamabad and Rawalpindi ) . In the United States , the concept of the metropolitan statistical area has gained prominence . Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of larger megalopolises . For urban centres outside metropolitan areas , that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region , the concept of the regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006 . In the United States , the term micropolitan statistical area is used",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products",
  "/wiki/Table_salt": "Salt is a mineral consisting primarily of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts ; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite . Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater , where it is the main mineral constituent . The open ocean has about 35 grams ( 1.2 oz ) of solids per liter of sea water , a salinity of 3.5 % . Salt is essential for life in general , and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes . Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings , and salting is an important method of food preservation . Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC , when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts ; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period . Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites , Egyptians , and the Indians . Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea , along specially built salt roads , and across the Sahara on camel caravans . The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues . Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance . Salt is processed from salt mines , and by the evaporation of seawater ( sea salt ) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools . Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine ; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride , plastics , paper pulp and many other products",

The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died . The death toll includes 960,000 Jews ( 865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival ) , 74,000 non-Jewish Poles , 21,000 Roma , 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and up to 15,000 other Europeans . Those not gassed died of starvation , exhaustion , disease , individual executions , or beatings . Others were killed during medical experiments .

The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control of the police by Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann G\u00f6ring . Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers , the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners . In 1933-1939 , before the onset of war , most prisoners consisted of German Communists , Socialists , Social Democrats , Roma , Jehovah 's Witnesses , homosexuals , and persons accused of 'asocial ' or socially 'deviant ' behavior by the Germans . Heinrich Himmler 's Schutzstaffel ( SS ) took full control of the police and the concentration camps throughout Germany in 1934-35 . The role of the camps expanded to hold so-called undesirables such as Jews , Romanis/Sintis , Serbs , Soviet POWs , Poles , disabled people , and clergymen . The number of people in the camps , which had fallen to 7,500 , grew again to 21,000 by the start of World War II and peaked at 715,000 in January 1945 . Beginning in 1934 the concentration camps were administered by the Concentration Camps Inspectorate ( CCI ) , which in 1942 was merged into SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt , and they were guarded by SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde ( SS-TV ) .

Others were murdered at the death camps as well , including Poles , homosexuals , Soviet POWs , and Roma . The victims of death camps were primarily killed by gassing , either in permanent installations constructed for this specific purpose or by means of gas vans . Auschwitz and Majdanek death camps also used extreme work under starvation conditions in order to kill their prisoners . The idea of mass extermination with the use of stationary facilities , to which the victims were taken by train , was the result of earlier Nazi experimentation with chemically manufactured poison gas during the secretive Aktion T4 euthanasia programme against hospital patients with mental and physical disabilities . [ a ] The technology was adapted , expanded , and applied in wartime to unsuspecting victims of many ethnic and national groups ; the Jews were the primary target , accounting for over 90 percent of the extermination camp death toll . The genocide of the Jews of Europe was the Third Reich 's Final Solution to the Jewish question . It is now collectively known as the Holocaust , during which 11 million others were also murdered . Extermination camps were also set up by the fascist Usta\u0161e regime of the Independent State of Croatia , a puppet state of Germany , which carried out genocide between 1941 and 1945 against Serbs , Jews , Roma and its Croat and Bosniak Muslim political opponents",

The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law .

The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district . The annexation was part of the fourth partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union , outlined months before the invasion , in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact . Some smaller territories were incorporated directly into the existing Gaue East Prussia and Silesia , while the bulk of the land was used to create new Reichsgaue Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland . Of those , Reichsgau Wartheland was the largest and the only one comprising solely the annexed territory . The official term used by the Nazi authorities for these areas was the incorporated Eastern territories ( German : Eingegliederte Ostgebiete ) . They planned for a complete Germanization of the annexed territories , considering them part of their lebensraum . The local Jewish population was forced to live in ghettos , and was gradually deported to concentration and extermination camps , the most infamous of which , Auschwitz , was located in annexed East Upper Silesia . The local Polish population was to be gradually enslaved , exterminated and eventually replaced by German settlers . The Polish elite especially became subject to mass murder , and an estimated 780,000 Poles were subject to expulsion , either to the General Government or to the Altreich for forced labour . The remaining Polish population was strictly segregated from the German population and subject to a variety of repressive measures .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

For most of its existence , Monowitz was a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp ; from November 1943 it and other Nazi subcamps in the area were jointly known as Auschwitz III-subcamps ( KL Auschwitz III-Aussenlager ) . In November 1944 the Germans renamed it Monowitz concentration camp , after the village of Monowice ( German : Monowitz ) where it was built , in the annexed portion of Poland . SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer ( Captain ) Heinrich Schwarz was commandant from November 1943 to January 1945 . The SS established the camp in October 1942 at the behest of IG Farben executives to provide slave labor for their Buna Werke ( Buna Works ) industrial complex . The name Buna was derived from the butadiene-based synthetic rubber and the chemical symbol for sodium ( Na ) , a process of synthetic rubber production developed in Germany . Other German industrial enterprises built factories with their own subcamps , such as Siemens-Schuckert 's Bobrek subcamp , close to Monowitz , to profit from the use of slave labor . The German armaments manufacturer Krupp , headed by SS member Alfried Krupp , also built their own manufacturing facilities near Monowitz . Monowitz held around 12,000 prisoners , the great majority of whom were Jews , in addition to non-Jewish criminals and political prisoners . The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks ( RM ) per day for unskilled workers , four ( RM ) per hour for skilled workers , and one and one-half ( RM ) for children .

  "/wiki/Ancient_woodland": "In the United Kingdom , an ancient woodland is a woodland that has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England , Wales and Northern Ireland ( or 1750 in Scotland ) . Planting of woodland was uncommon before those dates , so a wood present in 1600 is likely to have developed naturally . In most ancient woods , the trees and shrubs have been cut down periodically as part of the management cycle . Provided that the area has remained as woodland , the stand is still considered ancient . Since it may have been cut over many times in the past , ancient woodland does not necessarily contain very old trees . For many species of animal and plant , ancient woodland sites provide the sole habitat , and for many others , conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites . Ancient woodland in the UK , like rainforest in the tropics , is home to rare and threatened species . For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource , or 'critical natural capital ' . The analogous term used in the United States and Canada is Old-growth forest . Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies . Mapping of ancient woodland has been undertaken in different ways and at different times , and the quality and availability of data varies from region to region , although there are some efforts to standardise and update it",

  "/wiki/Primeval_forest": "An old-growth forest - also termed primary forest , virgin forest , primeval forest , late seral forest , or forest primeval - is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community .

The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps , greatly varying tree heights and diameters , and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris . Old-growth forests are valuable for economic reasons and for the ecosystem services they provide . This can be a point of contention when some in the logging industry desire to cut down the forests to obtain valuable timber , while environmentalists seek to preserve the forests for benefits such as maintenance of biodiversity , water purification , flood control , and nutrient cycling .

Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty , the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon . He was nicknamed the Old in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor , Sigismund II Augustus . Sigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria . He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father . Sigismund 's eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia , Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Pod\u011bbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary , thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms . When Casimir died , the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons , with John Albert being crowned King of Poland , and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania . Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert 's sudden death in 1501 . Hence , Sigismund 's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39 . A capable monarch and a patron of arts , Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw , whilst retaining the nation 's wealth and prominence in the region . He assured that his nephew Albert , Duke of Prussia , and his Protestant successors will pay a feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence .

It is one of two extant species of bison , alongside the American bison . Three subspecies existed in the recent past , but only one , the nominate subspecies ( B. b. bonasus ) survives today . Analysis of mitochondrial genomes and nuclear DNA revealed that the wisent is theoretically the result of hybridisation between the extinct Steppe bison ( Bison priscus ) and the ancestors of the aurochs ( Bos primigenius ) since their genetic material contains up to 10 % aurochs genomic ancestry ; the possible hybrid is referred to informally as the Higgs bison , a play-on-words in reference to the Higgs boson . Alternatively , the Pleistocene woodland bison has been suggested as the ancestor to the species . European bison were hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 20th century , with the last wild animals of the B. b. bonasus subspecies being shot in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest ( on the Belarus-Poland border ) in 1921 , and the last of B. b. caucasus in the northwestern Caucasus in 1927 . B. b. hungarorum was hunted to extinction in the mid-1800s . The Bia\u0142owie\u017ca or lowland European bison was kept alive in captivity , and has since been reintroduced into several countries in Europe . They are now forest-dwelling .

The walls can be simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers , bastions and gates to access to the city . In ancient to modern times , they were used to enclose settlements . Generally , these are referred to as city walls or town walls , although there were also walls , such as the Great Wall of China , Walls of Benin , Hadrian 's Wall , Anastasian Wall , the Cyclopean Wall Rajgir and the metaphorical Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries . In mountainous terrain , defensive walls such as letzis were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack . Beyond their defensive utility , many walls also had important symbolic functions - representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced . Existing ancient walls are almost always masonry structures , although brick and timber-built variants are also known . Depending on the topography of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect , elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective . Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate city gate and are often supplemented with towers . The practice of building these massive walls , though having its origins in prehistory , was refined during the rise of city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe .

The crusades differed from other religious conflicts in that participants considered them a penitential exercise that brought absolution . Historians contest the definition of the term crusade with some restricting it to armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem ; others including all Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefits ; all Catholic holy wars ; or those with characteristic religious fervour . The most well known are those fought against the Muslims of the eastern Mediterranean for the Holy Land between 1096 and 1271 . Crusades were also fought from the 12th century against the Iberian Moors , the Ottoman Empire and in several other regions . The reasons for thesse included fighting pagans , the suppression of heresy and conflict between Catholic groups . In 1095 Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont . He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem . There was an enthusiastic response in western European across all social strata . Historians debate the combination of motivations of the volunteers who took a public vow to join the crusade - the prospect of mass ascension into Heaven at Jerusalem , satisfying feudal obligations , opportunities for renown , economic and political advantage are all considered . Four Crusader states were established in the Near East : the County of Edessa ; the Principality of Antioch ; the Kingdom of Jerusalem ; and the County of Tripoli . A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until Acre , the last mainland outpost , fell in 1291 , after which there were no further crusades to recover the Holy Land",

  "/wiki/Ordensburg_Marienburg": "The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork ( Polish : Zamek w Malborku ; German : Ordensburg Marienburg ) is a 13th-century Teutonic castle and fortress located near the town of Malbork , Poland . It is the largest castle in the world measured by land area and a UNESCO World Heritage Site . It was originally constructed by the Teutonic Knights , a German Catholic religious order of crusaders , in a form of an Ordensburg fortress . The Order named it Marienburg in honour of Mary , mother of Jesus . In 1457 , during the Thirteen Years War , it was sold by the Bohemian mercenaries to King Casimir IV of Poland in lieu of indemnities and it since served as one of the several Polish royal residences and the seat of Polish offices and institutions , interrupted by several years of Swedish occupation , and fulfilling this function until the First Partition of Poland in 1772 . From then on the castle was under German rule for over 170 years until 1945 . The castle is a classic example of a medieval fortress and , on its completion in 1406 , was the world 's largest brick castle . UNESCO designated the Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork and the Malbork Castle Museum a World Heritage Site in December 1997 . It is one of two World Heritage Sites in the region ( north-central Poland ) , together with the Medieval Town of Toru\u0144 , which was founded in 1231 . Malbork Castle is also one of Poland 's official national Historic Monuments ( Pomnik historii ) , as designated on 16 September 1994 .

  "/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)": "Mary [ c ] was a first-century BC Galilean Jewish woman of Nazareth , and the mother of Jesus , according to the New Testament and the Quran . The gospels of Matthew and Luke in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin . In Matthew and Luke she is betrothed to Joseph . According to Christian theology she conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit while still a virgin . She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem , where Jesus was born . According to Catholic and Eastern Christian teachings , at the end of her earthly life her body was raised directly into Heaven ; this is known in the Christian West as the Assumption . Mary has been venerated since early Christianity , and is considered by millions to be the most meritorious saint of the religion . She is said to have miraculously appeared to believers many times over the centuries . The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox , Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches believe that Mary , as mother of Jesus , is the Theotokos ( Mother of God ) ( Greek : \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 , romanized : Theotokos , lit .

  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged",
  "/wiki/Fortress": "A fortification is a military construction or building designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is also used to solidify rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from the Latin fortis ( strong ) and facere ( to make ) . From very early history to modern times , defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory",
  "/wiki/Brick_Gothic": "Brick Gothic ( German : Backsteingotik , Polish : Gotyk ceglany , Dutch : Baksteengotiek ) is a specific style of Gothic architecture common in Northwest and Central Europe especially in the regions in and around the Baltic Sea , which do not have resources of standing rock , but in many places a lot of glacial boulders . The buildings are essentially built using bricks . Buildings classified as Brick Gothic ( using a strict definition of the architectural style based on the geographic location ) are found in Belgium ( and the very north of France ) , Netherlands , Germany , Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , Kaliningrad ( former East Prussia ) , Sweden and Finland . As the use of baked red brick arrived in Northwestern and Central Europe in the 12th century , the oldest such buildings are classified as the Brick Romanesque . In the 16th century , Brick Gothic was superseded by Brick Renaissance architecture . Brick Gothic is characterised by the lack of figural architectural sculpture , widespread in other styles of Gothic architecture . Typical for the Baltic Sea region is the creative subdivision and structuring of walls , using built ornaments and the colour contrast between red bricks , glazed bricks and white lime plaster . Nevertheless , these characteristics are neither omnipresent nor exclusive . Many of the old town centres dominated by Brick Gothic , as well as some individual structures , have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites . The real extent and the real variety of this brick architecture has to be distinguished from the view of late 19th and early 20th century , especially the years around the end of World War I , when it was politically instrumentalized . Indeed , about a quarter of medieval Gothic brick architecture is standing in the Netherlands , in Flanders and in French Flanders . Some dominant buildings are combinations of brick and stone",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued",
  "/wiki/Brick": "A brick is building material used to make walls , pavements and other elements in masonry construction . Traditionally , the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil , sand , and lime , or concrete materials . Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them . Bricks are produced in numerous classes , types , materials , and sizes which vary with region and time period , and are produced in bulk quantities . Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks . Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials , but is usually larger than a brick . Lightweight bricks ( also called lightweight blocks ) are made from expanded clay aggregate . Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials , sometimes referred to as artificial stone , and have been used since circa 4000 BC . Air-dried bricks , also known as mudbricks , have a history older than fired bricks , and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw .

Growing from a few North German towns in the late 1100s , the league came to dominate Baltic maritime trade for three centuries along the coasts of Northern Europe . Hansa territories stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea and inland during the Late Middle Ages , and diminished slowly after 1450 . Hanse , later spelled as Hansa , was the Old High German word for a convoy , and this word was applied to bands of merchants traveling between the Hanseatic cities - whether by land or by sea . Merchant circles established the league to protect the guilds ' economic interests and diplomatic privileges in their affiliated cities and countries , as well as along the trade routes which the merchants used . The Hanseatic cities had their own legal system and operated their own armies for mutual protection and aid . Despite this , the organization was not a state , nor could it be called a confederation of city-states ; only a very small number of the cities within the league enjoyed autonomy and liberties comparable to those of a free imperial city",

  "/wiki/Lutheran": "Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther , a 16th-century German reformer . Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation . The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings , beginning with the 95 Theses , divided Western Christianity . The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms : the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas , subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property , half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation . The divide centered primarily on two points : the proper source of authority in the church , often called the formal principle of the Reformation , and the doctrine of justification , often called the material principle of Lutheran theology . [ a ] Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone , the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith . This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church , defined at the Council of Trent , concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition . Unlike Calvinism , Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper .

  "/wiki/Medieval": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued",
  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144",

  "/wiki/Polish_Gothic": "The Gothic style arrived in Poland in the first half of the 13th century with the arrival of members of the Dominican and Franciscan orders . The first elements of the new style are evident in the foundation of the Dominican Trinity church in Krak\u00f3w ( 1226-1250 ) , built by Bishop Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c . Another of the earliest manifestations of the Gothic in Poland was the rebuilding of the Wroc\u0142aw Cathedral which started in 1244 . The earliest building was completely covered in Poland , built in Gothic style chapel is considered St. Hedwig in Trzebnica ( 1268-1269 ) in the monastery of Cistercian . In the north and west of the country , there are some scarce Romanesque predecessors ( see here ) . Most Gothic buildings in Poland are made of brick , and belong to the Baltic Brick Gothic , especially in northern Poland ( see Significant Brick Gothic buildings in Poland ) . Nonetheless , not all Gothic buildings in Poland are made of brick . For example , the Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w is mostly stone-built . Poland also has some Gothic fieldstone churches , mostly of relatively small size . The centers of Polish Gothic are Krak\u00f3w , Gda\u0144sk , Toru\u0144 and Wroc\u0142aw . The reign of the king Casimir the Great was the time of the greatest flowering of gothic architecture in Poland . For the second time a similar development took place in the late Gothic phase , during the reign of Casimir the Jagiellonian",

The English garden presented an idealized view of nature . It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin , and from the classic Chinese gardens of the East , which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden . The English garden usually included a lake , sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees , and recreations of classical temples , Gothic ruins , bridges , and other picturesque architecture , designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape . The work of Lancelot Capability Brown was particularly influential . By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden , and as far away as St. Petersburg , Russia , in Pavlovsk , the gardens of the future Emperor Paul . It also had a major influence on the form of the public parks and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century . The English landscape garden was centred on the English country house",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban .

  "/wiki/Reinforced_concrete": "Reinforced concrete ( RC ) ( also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC ) is a composite material in which concrete 's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility . The reinforcement is usually , though not necessarily , steel reinforcing bars ( rebar ) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets . Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure . Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel , polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not . Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed ( concrete in compression , reinforcement in tension ) , so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads . In the United States , the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning . For a strong , ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least :",

[ note 1 ] The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era , also known as the Age of Reptiles . The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic-Jurassic extinction event . Two other extinction events occurred during the period : the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction in the Early Jurassic , and the Tithonian event at the end ; neither event ranks among the Big Five mass extinctions , however . The Jurassic period is divided into three epochs : Early , Middle , and Late . Similarly , in stratigraphy , the Jurassic is divided into the Lower Jurassic , Middle Jurassic , and Upper Jurassic series of rock formations . The Jurassic is named after the Jura Mountains within the European Alps , where limestone strata from the period were first identified . By the beginning of the Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses : Laurasia to the north , and Gondwana to the south . This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid , and many of the arid deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests . On land , the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna , dominated by both dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs , to one dominated by dinosaurs alone .

Flint was much in demand for making polished stone axes in the Neolithic period . Much later , when flint had been replaced by metal tools , flint nodules were in demand for other uses , such as for building and as strikers for muskets . Grime 's Graves was first extensively explored by the 19th-century archeologist William Greenwell . The scheduled monument extends over an area of some 37 ha ( 91 acres ) and consists of at least 433 shafts dug into the natural chalk to reach seams of flint . The largest shafts are more than 14 m ( 46 ft ) deep and 12 m ( 39 ft ) in diameter at the surface . It has been calculated that more than 2,000 tonnes of chalk had to be removed from the larger shafts , taking 20 men around five months , before stone of sufficient quality was reached . An upper 'topstone ' and middle 'wallstone ' seam of flint was dug through on the way to the deeper third 'floorstone ' seam which most interested the miners . The site is managed by English Heritage and can be visited . The site is also a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Geological Conservation Review site",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills )",

  "/wiki/Belgium": "Belgium , [ A ] officially the Kingdom of Belgium , is a country in Western Europe . It is bordered by the Netherlands to the north , Germany to the east , Luxembourg to the southeast , France to the southwest , and the North Sea to the northwest . It covers an area of 30,689 km2 ( 11,849 sq mi ) and has a population of more than 11.5 million , making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe , with a density of 376 per square kilometre ( 970/sq mi ) . The capital and largest city is Brussels ; other major cities are Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge . The sovereign state is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system . Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments"
