He has been described as a maverick and an iconoclast , notable for his versatility and independence . He is considered an auteur , whose films have always expressed his personal vision . :1 Kaufman 's works have included genres such as realism , horror , fantasy , erotica , Westerns , underworld crime , and inner city gangs . His choice of topics has been eclectic and sometimes controversial , having adapted novels with diverse themes and stories . Examples are Milan Kundera 's The Unbearable Lightness of Being ( 1988 ) , Michael Crichton 's Rising Sun ( 1993 ) , a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1978 ) , and the erotic writings of Ana\u00efs Nin 's Henry & June . His film The Wanderers ( 1979 ) has achieved cult status . But his greatest success was Tom Wolfe 's true-life The Right Stuff , which received eight Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture . According to film historian Annette Insdorf , no other living American director has so consistently and successfully made movies for adults , tackling sensuality , artistic creation , and manipulation by authorities . :1 Other critics note that Kaufman 's films are strong on mood and atmosphere , with powerful cinematography and a lyrical , poetic style to portray different historic periods . His later films have a somewhat European style , but the stories always stress individualism and integrity , and are clearly American .",

  "/wiki/Harold_Lloyd": "Harold Clayton Lloyd Sr. ( April 20 , 1893 - March 8 , 1971 ) was an American actor , comedian , and stunt performer who appeared in many silent comedy films . Lloyd is considered alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most influential film comedians of the silent film era . Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films , both silent and talkies , between 1914 and 1947 . His bespectacled Glass character was a resourceful , success-seeking go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States . His films frequently contained thrill sequences of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats . Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street ( in reality a trick shot ) in Safety Last ! ( 1923 ) is considered one of the most enduring images in all of cinema . Lloyd performed the lesser stunts himself , despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio . An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand ( the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove , and was almost undetectable on the screen ) . Although Lloyd 's individual films were not as commercially successful as Chaplin 's on average , he was far more prolific ( releasing 12 feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four ) , and made more money overall ( $ 15.7 million to Chaplin 's $ 10.5 million ) .

  "/wiki/Our_Gang": "Our Gang ( known subsequently to television syndication as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) is an American series of comedy short films chronicling a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures . Created by comedy producer and studio executive Hal Roach , the series was produced in various forms from 1922 to 1944 and is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way . Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected , raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles . The series broke new ground by portraying white and black children interacting as equals . The franchise began in 1922 as a series of silent short subjects produced by the Roach studio and released by Path\u00e9 Exchange . Roach changed distributors from Path\u00e9 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927 , and the series entered its most popular period after converting to sound in 1929 . Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938 , when the series was sold to MGM , which produced the comedies until 1944 . Across 220 short films and a feature-film spin-off , General Spanky , the Our Gang series featured over 41 child actors as regular members of cast . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights , the 80 Roach-produced talkies were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955 . Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Television ) have since remained in syndication .

  "/wiki/Buster_Keaton": "Joseph Frank Keaton ( October 4 , 1895 - February 1 , 1966 ) , known professionally as Buster Keaton , was an American actor , comedian , film director , producer , screenwriter , and stunt performer . He is best known for his silent films , in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic , deadpan expression that earned him the nickname The Great Stone Face . Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton 's extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929 when he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies . His career declined afterward with a loss of artistic independence when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , his wife divorced him , and he descended into alcoholism . He recovered in the 1940s , remarried , and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life , earning an Honorary Academy Award in 1959 . Many of Keaton 's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded , such as Sherlock Jr. ( 1924 ) , The General ( 1926 ) , and The Cameraman ( 1928 ) , with The General widely viewed as his masterpiece . Among its strongest admirers was Orson Welles , who stated that The General was cinema 's highest achievement in comedy , and perhaps the greatest film ever made . Keaton in 1996 was recognized as the seventh-greatest film director by Entertainment Weekly , and the American Film Institute ranked him in 1999 as the 21st greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema .",

  "/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin": "Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE ( 16 April 1889 - 25 December 1977 ) was an English comic actor , filmmaker , and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film . He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona , The Tramp , and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry . His career spanned more than 75 years , from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977 , and encompassed both adulation and controversy . Chaplin 's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship , as his father was absent and his mother struggled financially , and he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine . When he was 14 , his mother was committed to a mental asylum . Chaplin began performing at an early age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian . At 19 , he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America . He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios . He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base . He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations . By 1918 , he was one of the best-known figures in the world . In 1919 , Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists , which gave him complete control over his films .",

  "/wiki/Felix_the_Cat": "Felix the Cat is a funny-animal cartoon character created in the silent film era . The anthropomorphic black cat with his black body , white eyes , and giant grin , coupled with the surrealism of the situations in which his cartoons place him , combine to make Felix one of the most recognized cartoon characters in film history . Felix was the first character from animation to attain a level of popularity sufficient to draw movie audiences . Felix originated from the studio of Australian cartoonist/film entrepreneur Pat Sullivan . Either Sullivan himself or his lead animator , American Otto Messmer , created the character . What is certain is that Felix emerged from Sullivan 's studio , and cartoons featuring the character enjoyed success and popularity in popular culture . Aside from the animated shorts , Felix starred in a comic strip ( drawn by Sullivan , Messmer and later Joe Oriolo ) beginning in 1923 , and his image soon adorned merchandise such as ceramics , toys and postcards . Several manufacturers made stuffed Felix toys . Jazz bands such as Paul Whiteman 's played songs about him ( 1923 's Felix Kept on Walking and others ) . By the late 1920s , with the arrival of sound cartoons , Felix 's success was fading . The new Disney shorts of Mickey Mouse made the silent offerings of Sullivan and Messmer , who were then unwilling to move to sound production , seem outdated . In 1929 , Sullivan decided to make the transition and began distributing Felix sound cartoons through Copley Pictures .",
