  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",

Despite his bandmates ' reservations , he persevered with the song and insisted it be included on their next single .

  "/wiki/Here_Comes_the_Sun": "Here Comes the Sun is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 album Abbey Road . It was written by George Harrison and is one of his best-known compositions for the Beatles . Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton , where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles ' Apple Corps organisation . The lyrics reflect his relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band 's business affairs . As of September 2019 , it was the most streamed Beatles song in the United Kingdom , with over 50 million plays . The Beatles recorded Here Comes the Sun at London 's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969 . Led by Harrison 's acoustic guitar , the track features Moog synthesizer , which he had introduced to the band 's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California . Reflecting the continued influence of Indian classical music on Harrison 's writing , the composition includes several time signature changes . Here Comes the Sun has received acclaim from music critics . Combined with his other contribution to Abbey Road , Something , it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney . Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist , including at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 and , with Paul Simon , during his appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1976 . Richie Havens and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel each had hit singles with Here Comes the Sun in the 1970s .",
