The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse , a military fortification , a military prison , and a federal prison from 1934 until 21 March 1963 . The water currents around the island were high at all times , which presumably decreased the chance of an inmate escaping . Beginning in November 1969 , the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco , who were part of a wave of Native American activism across the U.S. , with public protests through the 1970s . In 1972 , Alcatraz became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986 . Today , the island 's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area ; it is open to tours . Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by ferry ride from Pier 33 , located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman 's Wharf , San Francisco . Hornblower Cruises and Events , operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises , is the official ferry provider to and from the island . Alcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison , the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States , early military fortifications , and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony ( mostly western gulls , cormorants , and egrets ) . According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz , the island measures 1,675 feet ( 511 m ) by 590 feet ( 180 m ) and is 135 feet ( 41 m ) at highest point during mean tide . The total area of the island is reported to be 22 acres ( 8.9 ha ) . Landmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse , Dining Hall , Lighthouse , the ruins of the Warden 's House and Social Hall , Parade Grounds , Building 64 , Water Tower , New Industries Building , Model Industries Building , and the Recreation Yard .",

The great white shark is notable for its size , with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m ( 20 ft ) in length and 1,905-2,268 kg ( 4,200-5,000 lb ) in weight at maturity . However , most are smaller ; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m ( 11 to 13 ft ) , and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m ( 15 to 16 ft ) on average . According to a 2014 study , the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more , well above previous estimates , making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known . According to the same study , male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity , while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring . Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h ( 35 mph ) , and can swim to depths of 1,200 m ( 3,900 ft ) . The great white shark has no known natural predators other than , on very rare occasions , the killer whale . The great white shark is arguably the world 's largest known extant macropredatory fish , and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals , up to the size of large baleen whales . It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals , including fish , and seabirds . It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon , and is responsible for more recorded human bite incidents than any other shark . The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection . The IUCN lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species , and it is included in Appendix II of CITES .",

  "/wiki/Redneck": "Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated , closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States .

This word is usually considered offensive . People from the white South sometimes jocularly call themselves rednecks as insider humour . By the 1970s , the term had become offensive slang , its meaning expanded to include racism , loutishness , and opposition to modern ways . Patrick Huber , in his monograph A Short History of Redneck : The Fashioning of a Southern White Masculine Identity , emphasized the theme of masculinity in the 20th-century expansion of the term , noting , The redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor , dirty , uneducated , and racist Southern white man .",

  "/wiki/Pirate": "Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area , typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties . Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates . The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC , when the Sea Peoples , a group of ocean raiders , attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations . Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy , as well as for privateering and commerce raiding . Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar , the Strait of Malacca , Madagascar , the Gulf of Aden , and the English Channel , whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks . A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes . Privateering uses similar methods to piracy , but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation , making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors . While the term can include acts committed in the air , on land ( especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train ) , or in other major bodies of water or on a shore , in cyberspace , as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy , it generally refers to maritime piracy . It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator ( e.g . one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel ) . Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states . In the early 21st century , seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue ( with estimated worldwide losses of US $ 16 billion per year in 2004 ) , particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , off the Somali coast , and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore .",

The final design was done by Dabney , possibly with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn . The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway . The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn ; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid , Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race . Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco before the rest of the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet . Space Race was not commercially successful ; Bushnell has stated that it was much less popular than Pong . Midway held that the release of Space Race violated Atari 's contract with them for Asteroid , and the companies agreed for Atari to forfeit royalty payments for the game .",

  "/wiki/Asteroid": "Asteroids are minor planets , especially of the inner Solar System . Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids . These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail . As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets , these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt . In this article , the term asteroid refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System , including those co-orbital with Jupiter . There exist millions of asteroids , many the shattered remnants of planetesimals , bodies within the young Sun 's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets . The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , or are co-orbital with Jupiter ( the Jupiter trojans ) . However , other orbital families exist with significant populations , including the near-Earth objects . Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra , with the majority falling into three main groups : C-type , M-type , and S-type . These were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich , metallic , and silicate ( stony ) compositions , respectively . The sizes of asteroids varies greatly ; the largest , Ceres , is almost 1,000 km ( 600 mi ) across and massive enough to be a dwarf planet .
