With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5 % of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture",

It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50 % of its prewar population and around 25-33 % of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay .

[ note 1 ] Suriname has a population of approximately 575,990 , most of whom live on the country 's north coast , in and around the capital and largest city , Paramaribo . Suriname was long inhabited by various indigenous people before being invaded and contested by European powers from the 16th century , eventually coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century . As the chief sugar colony during the Dutch colonial period , it was primarily a plantation economy dependent on African slaves and , following the abolition of slavery in 1863 , indentured servants from Asia . Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-chartered company Society of Suriname between 1683 and 1795 . In 1954 , Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . On 25 November 1975 , the country of Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an independent state , nonetheless maintaining close economic , diplomatic , and cultural ties to its former colonizer . Suriname is considered to be a culturally Caribbean country , and is a member of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) . While Dutch is the official language of government , business , media , and education , Sranan Tongo , an English-based creole language , is a widely used lingua franca .

It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east , with the R\u00edo de la Plata ( River of Silver ) to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast .

With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers ( 68,000 sq mi ) , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America , after Suriname . Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento in 1680 ; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries . Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity",

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007 , when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , which he led until 2012 . Born into a middle class family in Sabaneta , Barinas , Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and , after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact , founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 ( MBR-200 ) in the early 1980s . Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992 , for which he was imprisoned . Pardoned from prison after two years , he founded a political party known as the Fifth Republic Movement and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 with 56.2 % of the vote . He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8 % of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8 % of the vote . After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1 % of the vote , he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013 . However , the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment , and he died in Caracas on 5 March 2013 at the age of 58 . Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1999 , Ch\u00e1vez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution . Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s , his government nationalized key industries , created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food , housing , healthcare and education . The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez ' presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty , literacy , income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007 , with a reversal beginning after around 2012 ; beyond falling oil prices , there are arguments that government policies did not address structural inequalities . On 2 June 2010 , Ch\u00e1vez declared an economic war on Venezuela 's upper classes due to shortages , arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela"
