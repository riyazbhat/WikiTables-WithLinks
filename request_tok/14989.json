Colonel William Light , one of Adelaide 's founding fathers , designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens , in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga ( place of the red kangaroo ) . Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands .

  "/wiki/Methamphetamine": "Methamphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from N-methylamphetamine ) is a potent central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity . Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers : levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine . [ note 2 ] Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms . It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant , among other concerns , as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy . Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine . Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use . The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia , Oceania , and in the United States , where racemic methamphetamine , levomethamphetamine , and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances . Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States . [ note 3 ] Internationally , the production , distribution , sale , and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries , due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty . While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug , racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors . In low to moderate doses , methamphetamine can elevate mood , increase alertness , concentration and energy in fatigued individuals , reduce appetite , and promote weight loss . At very high doses , it can induce psychosis , breakdown of skeletal muscle , seizures and bleeding in the brain ."
