  "/wiki/Christopher_Lasch": "Robert Christopher Lasch ( 1932-1994 ) was an American historian , moralist , and social critic who was a history professor at the University of Rochester . Lasch sought to use history as a tool to awaken American society to the pervasiveness with which major institutions , public and private , were eroding the competence and independence of families and communities . He strove to create a historically informed social criticism that could teach Americans how to deal with rampant consumerism , proletarianization , and what he famously labeled the culture of narcissism . His books , including The New Radicalism in America ( 1965 ) , Haven in a Heartless World ( 1977 ) , The Culture of Narcissism ( 1979 ) , The True and Only Heaven ( 1991 ) , and The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy ( published posthumously in 1996 ) were widely discussed and reviewed . The Culture of Narcissism became a surprise best-seller and won the National Book Award in the category Current Interest ( paperback ) . [ a ] Lasch was always a critic of modern liberalism and a historian of liberalism 's discontents , but over time his political perspective evolved dramatically . In the 1960s , he was a neo-Marxist and acerbic critic of Cold War liberalism . During the 1970s , he supported certain aspects of cultural conservatism with a left-leaning critique of capitalism , and drew on Freud-influenced critical theory to diagnose the ongoing deterioration that he perceived in American culture and politics . His writings are sometimes denounced by feminists and hailed by conservatives for his apparent defense of the traditional [ clarification needed ] family . [ citation needed ] He eventually concluded that an often unspoken but pervasive faith in Progress tended to make Americans resistant to many of his arguments . In his last major works he explored this theme in depth , suggesting that Americans had much to learn from the suppressed and misunderstood populist and artisan movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .",

  "/wiki/Divergent_(novel)": "Divergent is the debut novel of American novelist Veronica Roth , published by Harper Collins Children 's Books in 2011 . The novel is the first of the Divergent trilogy , a series of young adult dystopian novels set in a Divergent Universe . The novel Divergent features a post-apocalyptic version of Chicago and follows Beatrice Tris Prior as she explores her identity within a society that defines its citizens by their social and personality-related affiliation with five factions , which removes the threat of anyone exercising independent will and re-threatening the population 's safety . Underlying the action and dystopian focused main plot is a romantic subplot between Tris and one of her instructors in the Dauntless faction , nicknamed Four . The novel has been compared to other young adult books such as The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner because of its similar themes and target audience . In particular , the novel explores the themes common to young adult fiction , such as adult authority and the transition from childhood to maturity , as well as such broader motifs as the place of violence and social structures within a post-apocalyptic society . Its major plot device , the division of society into personality types , is one used in other science fiction works . Beyond its literary context , Roth 's open declaration of her religion as a Christian has brought commentary from Christian communities both endorsing and challenging the novel . Roth wrote Divergent while working on a Creative Writing degree at Northwestern University , and it was quickly purchased for publication alongside the subsequent books in the trilogy ( completed in October 2013 ) . Summit Entertainment purchased the media rights to the book in 2011 and subsequently produced a film adaptation titled Divergent which was released March 21 , 2014 .
