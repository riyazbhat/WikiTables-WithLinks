Dinamo Tbilisi was one of the most prominent clubs in Soviet football and a major contender in the Soviet Top League almost immediately after it was established in 1936 . The club was then part of one of the leading sport societies in the Soviet Union , the All-Union Dynamo sports society which had several other divisions besides football and was sponsored by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs . Its main claim to European fame was winning the Cup Winners ' Cup in 1981 , beating FC Carl Zeiss Jena of East Germany 2-1 in the final in D\u00fcsseldorf .

After the break-up of the Soviet Union , it would later produce some of the finest Georgian players such as Temur Ketsbaia , Shota Arveladze , Giorgi Kinkladze , Kakha Kaladze , and Levan Kobiashvili . Dinamo Tbilisi was one of a handful of teams in the Soviet Top League ( along with Dynamo Kyiv and Dynamo Moscow ) that were never relegated . Their most famous coach was Nodar Akhalkatsi , who led the team to the Soviet title in 1978 , two Soviet Cups ( 1976 and 1979 ) , and the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup in 1981 .
