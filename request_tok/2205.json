Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar , Leno only once used a guest host , preferring to host the series in person . The series , which followed the same basic format as that of its predecessors ( an opening monologue followed by comedy routines , interviews and performances ) , ran until May 29 , 2009 , after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien . NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot . The primetime series , titled The Jay Leno Show , debuted on September 14 , 2009 , following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of Tonight . Neither O'Brien 's version of the program , which premiered June 1 , 2009 , nor The Jay Leno Show generated the ratings NBC had expected . The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno 's show to O'Brien 's time slot , and O'Brien 's Tonight Show a half-hour later . This decision met with opposition from O'Brien , whose stint on The Tonight Show ended January 22 , 2010 , after which he began his own talk show , Conan , on TBS . The Tonight Show with Jay Leno then began its second incarnation , the sixth of the franchise , on March 1 , 2010 . Leno left The Tonight Show for good on February 6 , 2014 and on February 17 , was succeeded by Late Night host Jimmy Fallon , at which time the series returned to New York for the first time since 1972 .",
