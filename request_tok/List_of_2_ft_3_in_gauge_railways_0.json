  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland",

  "/wiki/Funicular": "A funicular ( /fju\u02d0\u02c8n\u026akj\u028al\u0259r/ ) is a type of a grade-separated fixed guideway transit system powered by a cable traction designed for steep inclines . Specifically this system is using two counterbalanced track-guided passenger cars or small trains permanently attached to the opposite ends of a single cable - which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track . A funicular 's two cars move in concert : as one ascends , the other descends simultaneously , an arrangement that distinguishes a funicular from other cable-guided transportation systems - e.g. , a single car inclined elevator . The term funicular derives from the Latin word funiculus , the diminutive of funis , meaning rope",
  "/wiki/Corris_Railway": "The Corris Railway ( Welsh : Rheilffordd Corris ) is a narrow gauge preserved railway based in Corris on the border between Merionethshire ( now Gwynedd ) and Montgomeryshire ( now Powys ) in Mid-Wales .

Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs .

It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express .

The line was opened in 1865 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn , and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage . Despite severe under-investment , the line remained open , and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers . Since preservation , the railway has operated as a tourist attraction , expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages . In 1976 , an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol . In 2001 , the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary , and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place , including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum .
