  "/wiki/Platte_River": "The Platte River /pl\u00e6t/ is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about 310 mi ( 500 km ) long . Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River , it flows for over 1,050 miles ( 1,690 km ) . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River , which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico . The Platte over most of its length is a muddy , broad , shallow , meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islands - a braided stream . These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel , and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers . [ citation needed ] The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri , draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming . The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States , providing the route for several major emigrant trails , including the Oregon , California , Mormon and Bozeman trails . The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714 ; they first called it the Nebraskier ( Nebraska ) , a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people , meaning flat water . This expression is very close to the French words rivi\u00e8re plate ( flat river ) , the probable origin of the name Platte River .",
