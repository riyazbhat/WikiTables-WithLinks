  "/wiki/Alpine_skiing": "Alpine skiing , or downhill skiing , is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings , unlike other types of skiing ( cross-country , Telemark , or ski jumping ) , which use skis with free-heel bindings . Whether for recreation or for sport , it is typically practised at ski resorts , which provide such services as ski lifts , artificial snow making , snow grooming , restaurants , and ski patrol . Off-piste skiers - those skiing outside ski area boundaries - may employ snowmobiles , helicopters or snowcats to deliver them to the top of a slope . Back-country skiers may use specialized equipment with a free-heel mode , including 'sticky ' skins on the bottoms of the skis to stop them sliding backwards during an ascent , then locking the heel and removing the skins for their descent . Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 .",

  "/wiki/Water_polo": "Water polo is a competitive team sport played in the water between two teams . The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team 's goal . The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match . Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper . Except for the goalkeeper , players participate in both offensive and defensive roles . Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool meaning that players can not touch the bottom . A game of water polo mainly consists of the players swimming to move about the pool , treading water ( often using the eggbeater kick technique ) , passing the ball and shooting at the goal . Teamwork , tactical thinking and game awareness are also highly important aspects in a game of water polo . Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the toughest sports to play . Special equipment for water polo includes a water polo ball , a yellow-green ball which floats on the water ; numbered and coloured caps ; and two goals , which either float in the water or are attached to the side of the pool . The game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the late 19th century as a sort of water rugby . William Wilson is thought to have developed the game during a similar period .",

  "/wiki/Team_handball": "Handball ( also known as team handball , European handball or Olympic handball ) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each ( six outcourt players and a goalkeeper ) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team . A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes , and the team that scores more goals wins . Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres ( 131 by 66 ft ) , with a goal in the middle of each end . The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter ( 20 ft ) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed ; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while diving into it . The sport is usually played indoors , but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball , Czech handball ( which were more common in the past ) and beach handball . The game is fast and high-scoring : professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each , though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago . Some players may score hat tricks . Body contact is permitted : the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal . No protective equipment is mandated , but players may wear soft protective bands , pads and mouth guards . The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark . The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany , and had several revisions since . The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930 .",

  "/wiki/Table_tennis": "Table tennis , also known as ping-pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets . The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net . Except for the initial serve , the rules are generally as follows : players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table , and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once . A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules . Play is fast and demands quick reactions . Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent 's options , giving the hitter a great advantage . Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) , founded in 1926 . ITTF currently includes 226 member associations . The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook . Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , with several event categories . From 1988 until 2004 , these were men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's doubles and women 's doubles . Since 2008 , a team event has been played instead of the doubles .",

He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

  "/wiki/Figure_skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions ."
