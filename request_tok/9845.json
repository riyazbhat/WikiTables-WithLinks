A total of six series were broadcast , incorporating sixty individual films , several of which were broadcast as stand-alone specials . The series was born following the demise of the BBC 's Play for Today , which ran from 1970 to 1984 . Producer Kenneth Trodd was asked to formulate a new series of one-off television dramas , the result of which was Screen Two , which began broadcasting on BBC2 in 1985 . However , while Play for Today 's style had often been a largely studio-based form of theatre on television , Screen Two was shot entirely on film . In 1989 , the series was adapted for more mainstream audiences on BBC1 , and Screen One was born to follow the lead taken by Channel 4 , whose many television films had later been released in Cinemas . Screen One attracted many names familiar to television and film audiences , including the likes of Alfred Molina , Sean Bean , David Thewlis , Ray Winstone , Alan Bates , Judi Dench , James Fox , Keith Allen , Bob Peck , Alun Armstrong , Marina Sirtis , David Jason , Brenda Blethyn , James Bolam , Adrian Edmondson , Alison Steadman , Timothy West , Clive Russell and Janet McTeer . Several actors also made their on-screen debuts during the series , including Keira Knightley in the fifth series episode Royal Celebration . By 1993 , the prevailing mood within the BBC was to move away from single dramas and concentrate production on series and serials , and as such , a reduced six-episode series , broadcast in 1994 , was to be the last full-length series of Screen One ; although a further eight , one-off specials followed , with the final episode being broadcast on 15 February 1998 .",

  "/wiki/Charles_Dickens": "Charles John Huffam Dickens FRSA ( /\u02c8d\u026ak\u026anz/ ; 7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic . He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",
