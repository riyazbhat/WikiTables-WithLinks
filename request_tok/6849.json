  "/wiki/Anti-gravity": "Anti-gravity ( also known as non-gravitational field ) is creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity . It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit , or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force , such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift . Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction , particularly in the context of spacecraft propulsion . Examples are the gravity blocking substance Cavorite in H. G. Wells 's The First Men in the Moon and the Spindizzy machines in James Blish 's Cities in Flight . Anti-gravity is often used to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means , such as lifters , which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields .",
  "/wiki/Artificial_gravity": "Artificial gravity ( sometimes referred to as pseudogravity ) is the creation of an inertial force that mimics the effects of a gravitational force , usually by rotation . Artificial gravity , or rotational gravity , is thus the appearance of a centrifugal force in a rotating frame of reference ( the transmission of centripetal acceleration via normal force in the non-rotating frame of reference ) , as opposed to the force experienced in linear acceleration , which by the equivalence principle is indistinguishable from gravity . In a more general sense , artificial gravity may also refer to the effect of linear acceleration , e.g . by means of a rocket engine . Rotational simulated gravity has been used in simulations to help astronauts train for extreme conditions . Rotational simulated gravity has been proposed as a solution in human spaceflight to the adverse health effects caused by prolonged weightlessness . However , there are no current practical outer space applications of artificial gravity for humans due to concerns about the size and cost of a spacecraft necessary to produce a useful centripetal force comparable to the gravitational field strength on Earth ( g ) .",
  "/wiki/Asteroid_mining": "Asteroid mining is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids and other minor planets , including near-Earth objects . Hard rock minerals could be mined from an asteroid or a spent comet . Precious metals such as gold , silver , and platinum group metals could be transported back to Earth , whilst iron group metals and other common ones could be used for construction in space . Difficulties include the high cost of spaceflight , unreliable identification of asteroids which are suitable for mining , and ore extraction challenges . Thus , terrestrial mining remains the only means of raw mineral acquisition used today . If space program funding , either public or private , dramatically increases , this situation may change as resources on Earth become increasingly scarce compared to demand and the full potentials of asteroid mining - and space exploration in general - are researched in greater detail . :47f",
  "/wiki/Hypertelescope": "Antoine \u00c9mile Henry Labeyrie ( born 12 May 1943 ) is a French astronomer , who held the Observational astrophysics chair at the Coll\u00e8ge de France between 1991 and 2014 , where he is currently professor emeritus . He is working with the Hypertelescope Lise association , which aims to develop an extremely large astronomical interferometer with spherical geometry that might theoretically show features on Earth-like worlds around other suns , as its president . He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences in the Sciences of the Universe ( sciences de l'univers ) section . Between 1995 and 1999 he was director of the Haute-Provence Observatory . Labeyrie graduated from the grande \u00e9cole SupOptique ( \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure d'optique ) . He invented speckle interferometry , and works with astronomical interferometers . Labeyrie concentrated particularly on the use of diluted optics beam combination or densified pupils of a similar type but larger scale than those Michelson used for measuring the diameters of stars in the 1920s , in contrast to other astronomical interferometer researchers who generally switched to pupil-plane beam combination in the 1980s and 1990s . The main-belt asteroid 8788 Labeyrie ( 1978 VP2 ) is named in honor of Antoine \u00c9mile Henry Labeyrie and Catherine Labeyrie . In 2000 , he was awarded The Benjamin Franklin Medal .",
  "/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot": "Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip , to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away . It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner , Stephen Hawking , and Mark Zuckerberg . A flyby mission has been proposed to Proxima Centauri b , an Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone of its host star , Proxima Centauri , in the Alpha Centauri system . At a speed between 15 % and 20 % of the speed of light , it would take between twenty and thirty years to complete the journey , and approximately four years for a return message from the starship to Earth . The conceptual principles to enable this interstellar travel project were described in A Roadmap to Interstellar Flight , by Philip Lubin of UC Santa Barbara . Sending the lightweight spacecraft involves a multi-kilometer phased array of beam-steerable lasers with a combined coherent power output of up to 100 GW .",
  "/wiki/Solar_lens": "A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter ( such as a cluster of galaxies ) between a distant light source and an observer , that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer . This effect is known as gravitational lensing , and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity . ( Classical physics also predicts the bending of light , but only half of that predicted by general relativity . ) Although Einstein made unpublished calculations on the subject in 1912 , Orest Khvolson ( 1924 ) and Frantisek Link ( 1936 ) are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print . However , this effect is more commonly associated with Einstein , who published an article on the subject in 1936 . Fritz Zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses . It was not until 1979 that this effect was confirmed by observation of the so-called Twin QSO SBS 0957+561 .",
  "/wiki/Inflatable_space_habitat": "Inflatable habitats or expandable habitats are pressurized structures capable of supporting life in outer space whose internal volume increases after launch . They have frequently been proposed for use in space applications to provide a greater volume of living space for a given mass . The first formal design and manufacture of an inflatable space habitat was in 1961 with a space station design produced by Goodyear ( although this design was never flown ) . A proposal released in 1989 by Johnson Space Center 's Man Systems Division outlined a 16 metres ( 52 ft ) diameter spherical habitat lunar outpost which was partially buried in the lunar surface . An inflatable module called TransHab ( a portmanteau of Trans Habitation ) was proposed for the International Space Station , and later the private company Bigelow Aerospace revived the design for use in a number of potential civil and commercial applications .",
  "/wiki/Miniaturized_satellite": "A small satellite , miniaturized satellite , or smallsat is a satellite of low mass and size , usually under 500 kg ( 1,100 lb ) . While all such satellites can be referred to as small , different classifications are used to categorize them based on mass . Satellites can be built small to reduce the large economic cost of launch vehicles and the costs associated with construction . Miniature satellites , especially in large numbers , may be more useful than fewer , larger ones for some purposes - for example , gathering of scientific data and radio relay . Technical challenges in the construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power storage or of room for a propulsion system .",
  "/wiki/Reusable_launch_system": "A reusable launch system is a space launch system that includes the recovery of some or all of the component stages . To date , several fully reusable sub-orbital systems and partially reusable orbital systems have been flown . The first reusable launch vehicle to reach orbit was the Space Shuttle , which was not able to accomplish the intended goal of reducing launch costs to below those of expendable launch systems . SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , said if one can figure out how to reuse rockets like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred . SpaceX 's Falcon 9 rocket is the first reusable orbital-class launch system to be commercially successful , continuing its operation to date . During the 21st century , commercial interest in reusable launch systems has grown considerably , with several active launchers . The SpaceX 's Falcon 9 rocket has a reusable first stage and capsule ( for Dragon flights ) and expendable second stage , The Spaceship Company has flown reusable suborbital spaceplanes , and the suborbital Blue Origin New Shepard rocket has recoverable first stages and crew capsules .",
  "/wiki/Blue_Origin": "Blue Origin , LLC is an American privately funded aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company headquartered in Kent , Washington . Founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos , the company is led by CEO Bob Smith and is developing technologies to enable private human access to space with the goal to dramatically lower costs and increase reliability . Blue Origin is employing an incremental approach from suborbital to orbital flight , with each developmental step building on its prior work . The company motto is Gradatim Ferociter , Latin for Step by Step , Ferociously . Blue Origin is developing a variety of technologies , with a focus on rocket-powered vertical takeoff and vertical landing ( VTVL ) vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital space . The company 's name refers to the blue planet , Earth , as the point of origin . Initially focused on suborbital spaceflight , the company has designed , built and flown multiple testbeds of its New Shepard spacecraft at its facilities in Culberson County , Texas . Developmental test flights of the New Shepard , named after the first American in space Alan Shepard , began in April 2015 , and flight testing continued into 2018 . Blue has moved the date for first passengers back several times , with one recent planned timeframe being 2019 as of September 2018 . In the event , it has not yet begun commercial passenger flights , nor announced a firm date for when they would begin . On nearly every one of the test flights since 2015 , the uncrewed vehicle has reached a test altitude of more than 100 km ( 330,000 ft ) and achieved a top speed of more than Mach 3 ( 3,675 km/h ; 2,284 mph ) , reaching space above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , with both the space capsule and its rocket booster successfully soft landing . Blue Origin moved into the orbital spaceflight technology business in 2014 , initially as a rocket engine supplier for others via a contractual agreement to build a new large rocket engine , the BE-4 , for major US launch system operator United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) .",
  "/wiki/SpaceX": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , trading as SpaceX , is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne , California . It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars . SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft . SpaceX 's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit ( Falcon 1 in 2008 ) , the first private company to successfully launch , orbit , and recover a spacecraft ( Dragon in 2010 ) , the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station ( Dragon in 2012 ) , the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket ( Falcon 9 in 2015 ) , the first reuse of an orbital rocket ( Falcon 9 in 2017 ) , and the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the sun ( Falcon Heavy 's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018 ) . SpaceX has flown 18 resupply missions to the International Space Station ( ISS ) under a partnership with NASA . NASA also awarded SpaceX a further development contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon , which would be used to transport astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth . SpaceX conducted the maiden launch of its Dragon 2 spacecraft on a NASA-required demonstration flight ( Crew Dragon Demo-1 ) on March 2 , 2019 and is set to launch its first crewed Dragon 2 in March 2020 . In December 2015 , a Falcon 9 accomplished a propulsive vertical landing . This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight . In April 2016 , with the launch of CRS-8 , SpaceX successfully vertically landed the first stage on an ocean drone ship landing platform . In May 2016 , in another first , SpaceX again landed the first stage , but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission . In March 2017 , SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket .",
  "/wiki/Expendable_launch_vehicle": "An expendable launch system ( or expendable launch vehicle/ELV ) is a launch vehicle that can be launched only once , after which its components are either destroyed during reentry or discarded in space . ELVs typically consist of several rocket stages that are discarded sequentially as their fuel is exhausted and the vehicle gains altitude and speed . Most satellites and human spacecraft are currently [ when ? ] launched on ELVs . ELVs are simpler in design than reusable launch systems and therefore may have a lower production cost . Furthermore , an ELV can use its entire fuel supply to accelerate its payload , offering greater fuel efficiency . ELVs are proven technology in wide-spread use for many decades . ELVs are usable only once , and therefore have a significantly higher per-launch cost than reusable vehicles . New reusable launch systems under development by private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have the potential to obsolete many existing ELVs due to the lower per-launch costs of reusable rockets .",
  "/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition": "Space launch market competition is the manifestation of market forces in the launch service provider business . In particular it is the trend of competitive dynamics among payload transport capabilities at diverse prices having a greater influence on launch purchasing than the traditional political considerations of country of manufacture or the national entity using , regulating or licensing the launch service . Following the advent of spaceflight technology in the late 1950s , space launch services came into being , exclusively by national programs . Later in the 20th century commercial operators became significant customers of launch providers . International competition for the communications satellite payload subset of the launch market was increasingly influenced by commercial considerations . However , even during this period , for both commercial- and government-entity-launched commsats , the launch service providers for these payloads used launch vehicles built to government specifications , and with state-provided development funding exclusively . In the early 2010s , privately developed launch vehicle systems and space launch service offerings emerged . Companies now faced economic incentives rather than the principally political incentives of the earlier decades . The space launch business experienced a dramatic lowering of per-unit prices along with the addition of entirely new capabilities , bringing about a new phase of competition in the space launch market ."
