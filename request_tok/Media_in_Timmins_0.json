The station was previously owned by Haliburton Broadcasting Group before being sold to Vista Radio . The Haliburton Broadcasting Group was licensed by the CRTC in February 2001 to open up a new English-language commercial FM radio station in Timmins Ontario . The station originally launched in 2001 as an adult contemporary station branded as Mix 93 . Some current hot adult contemporary/contemporary hit radio singles were dayparted into the evening and overnight periods . However , around the same time as CHMT 's launch in 2001 , Telemedia moved the competing CKGB to FM as well as flipping that station 's format from country to adult contemporary . CHMT briefly responded by playing at least one country song an hour ; eventually , amid competition between the two stations for audience share and advertising revenue , CHMT adopted the Moose FM branding and a country music format in 2002 . In 2005 , Haliburton Broadcasting group received a license for a new FM radio station at 106.3 in North Bay , for which they proposed a format based on that of CHMT . The station launched in 2006 under the call letters CFXN . On March 13 , 2006 , after a day of stunting in which it played entirely Shania Twain music , the station dropped country music for an adult hits format as Timmins ' best of whatever , The Moose 93.1 FM .

  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart",

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station .
