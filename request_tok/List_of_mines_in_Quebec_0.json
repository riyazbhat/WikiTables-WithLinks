  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion",

  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2 % nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite",
  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) . Copper is sometimes used in decorative art , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments . Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents , fungicides , and wood preservatives",
  "/wiki/Cobalt": "Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27 . Like nickel , cobalt is found in the Earth 's crust only in chemically combined form , save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron . The free element , produced by reductive smelting , is a hard , lustrous , silver-gray metal . Cobalt-based blue pigments ( cobalt blue ) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints , and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass , but the color was later thought to be due to the known metal bismuth . Miners had long used the name kobold ore ( German for goblin ore ) for some of the blue-pigment-producing minerals ; they were so named because they were poor in known metals , and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted . In 1735 , such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal ( the first discovered since ancient times ) , and this was ultimately named for the kobold . Today , some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores , such as cobaltite ( CoAsS ) . The element is , however , more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining . The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production . World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes ( according to Natural Resources Canada ) , and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50 % . Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries , and in the manufacture of magnetic , wear-resistant and high-strength alloys . The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt ( II ) aluminate ( CoAl2O4 , cobalt blue ) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass , ceramics , inks , paints and varnishes",

Niobium is a light grey , crystalline , and ductile transition metal . Pure niobium has a hardness similar to that of pure titanium , [ contradictory ] and it has similar ductility to iron . Niobium oxidizes in the earth 's atmosphere very slowly , hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel . Niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite , hence the former name columbium . Its name comes from Greek mythology , specifically Niobe , who was the daughter of Tantalus , the namesake of tantalum . The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties , making them difficult to distinguish . The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium . In 1809 , the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical . The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium . In 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably . Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949 , but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States",
