  "/wiki/LCD": "A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers . Liquid crystals do not emit light directly , instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome . LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or fixed images with low information content , which can be displayed or hidden , such as preset words , digits , and seven-segment displays , as in a digital clock . They use the same basic technology , except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels , while other displays have larger elements . LCDs can either be normally on ( positive ) or off ( negative ) , depending on the polarizer arrangement . For example , a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight , and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight . Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance . LCDs are used in a wide range of applications , including LCD televisions , computer monitors , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and indoor and outdoor signage . Small LCD screens are common in portable consumer devices such as digital cameras , watches , calculators , and mobile telephones , including smartphones . LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as DVD players , video game devices and clocks . LCD screens have replaced heavy , bulky cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in nearly all applications . LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays , with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to very large television receivers .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

  "/wiki/Video_Game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",

  "/wiki/Movies": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",

  "/wiki/Video_On_Demand": "Video on demand ( VOD ) is a video media distribution system that allows users to access video entertainment without a traditional video entertainment device and without the constraints of a typical static broadcasting schedule . In the 20th century , broadcasting in the form of over-the-air programming was the commonest form of media distribution . As Internet and IPTV technologies continued to develop in the 1990s , consumers began to gravitate towards non-traditional modes of content consumption , which culminated in the arrival of VOD on televisions and personal computers . Unlike broadcast television , VOD systems initially required each user to have an Internet connection with considerable bandwidth to access each system 's content . In 2000 , the Fraunhofer Institute IIS developed the JPEG2000 codec , which enabled the distribution of movies via Digital Cinema Packages . This technology has since expanded its services from feature-film production to include broadcast television and has resulted in lower bandwidth requirements for VOD applications . Disney , Paramount , Sony , Universal and Warner Bros. subsequently launched the Digital Cinema Initiative , in 2002 . Television VOD systems can stream content , either through a traditional set-top box or through remote devices such as computers , tablets , and smartphones . VOD users can permanently download content to a device such as a computer , digital video recorder or a portable media player for continued viewing . The majority of cable and telephone company-based television providers offer VOD streaming , whereby a user selects a video program that begins to play immediately or downloading to a digital video recorder ( DVR ) rented or purchased from the provider , or to a PC or to a portable device for delayed viewing .

The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher .

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) . This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device .",

  "/wiki/OLED": "An organic light-emitting diode ( OLED or Organic LED ) , also known as an organic EL ( organic electroluminescent ) diode , is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current . This organic layer is situated between two electrodes ; typically , at least one of these electrodes is transparent . OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens , computer monitors , portable systems such as smartphones , handheld game consoles and PDAs . A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications . There are two main families of OLED : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers . Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell ( LEC ) which has a slightly different mode of operation . An OLED display can be driven with a passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix ( AMOLED ) control scheme . In the PMOLED scheme , each row ( and line ) in the display is controlled sequentially , one by one , whereas AMOLED control uses a thin-film transistor backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off , allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes . An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits visible light . Thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) . In low ambient light conditions ( such as a dark room ) , an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD , regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight . OLED displays are made in the same way as LCDs , but after TFT ( for active matrix displays ) , addressable grid ( for passive matrix displays ) or ITO segment ( for segment displays ) formation , the display is coated with hole injection , transport and blocking layers , as well with electroluminescent material after the 2 first layers , after which ITO or metal may be applied again as a cathode and later the entire stack of materials is encapsulated .",

  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power ."
