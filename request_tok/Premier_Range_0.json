I have had before me as a pillar of fire , he said , a policy of true Canadianism , of moderation , of reconciliation . He passionately defended individual liberty , Canada is free and freedom is its nationality , and Nothing will prevent me from continuing my task of preserving at all cost our civil liberty . Laurier was also well-regarded for his efforts to establish Canada as an autonomous country within the British Empire , and he supported the continuation of the Empire if it was based on absolute liberty political and commercial . In addition , he was a strict nationalist , argued for a more competitive Canada through limited government , and was an adherent of fiscal discipline . A 2011 Maclean 's historical ranking of the Prime Ministers placed Laurier first . Canada 's first francophone prime minister , Laurier holds a number of records . He is tied with Sir John A.

Born to a prosperous family in Bewdley , Worcestershire , Baldwin was educated at Hawtreys , Harrow School and Trinity College , Cambridge . He joined the family iron and steel making business and entered the House of Commons in 1908 as the Member of Parliament for Bewdley , succeeding his father Alfred . He served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury ( 1917-1921 ) and President of the Board of Trade ( 1921-1922 ) in the coalition ministry of David Lloyd George and then rose rapidly : in 1922 , Baldwin was one of the prime movers in the withdrawal of Conservative support from Lloyd George ; he subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Bonar Law 's Conservative ministry . Upon Bonar Law 's resignation due to health reasons in May 1923 , Baldwin became Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party . He called an election in December 1923 on the issue of tariffs and lost the Conservatives ' parliamentary majority , after which Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority Labour government . After winning the 1924 general election , Baldwin formed his second government , which saw important tenures of office by Sir Austen Chamberlain ( Foreign Secretary ) , Winston Churchill ( at the Exchequer ) and Neville Chamberlain ( Health ) . The latter two ministers strengthened Conservative appeal by reforms in areas formerly associated with the Liberal Party . They included industrial conciliation , unemployment insurance , a more extensive old-age pension system , slum clearance , more private housing and expansion of maternal and childcare . However , continuing sluggish economic growth and declines in mining and heavy industry weakened Baldwin 's base of support and his government also saw the General Strike in 1926 and the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 to curb the powers of trade unions . Baldwin narrowly lost the 1929 general election and his continued leadership of the party was subject to extensive criticism by the press barons Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaverbrook .

  "/wiki/Province_of_Canada": "The Province of Canada ( or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas ) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867 . Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton , 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837-1838 . The Act of Union 1840 , passed on 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841 , merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses , a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber . In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837-1838 , unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors . Firstly , Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues , and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements . Secondly , unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats , despite the larger population of Lower Canada . Although Durham 's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for responsible government ( a government accountable to an independent local legislature ) , only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841 . For the first seven years , the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the Queen 's Ministers . Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine-Baldwin ministry in 1849 , when Governor General James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party , effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role . The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867 , when it was divided into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada , while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada ( which had included Labrador until 1809 , when Labrador was transferred to the British colony of Newfoundland ) . Upper Canada was primarily English-speaking , whereas Lower Canada was primarily French-speaking"
