After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project , Disney bought a 160-acre ( 65 ha ) site near Anaheim in 1953 . Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17 , 1955 . Since its opening , Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations , including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966 , Bear Country ( now Critter Country ) in 1972 , Mickey 's Toontown in 1993 , and Star Wars : Galaxy 's Edge in 2019 .
