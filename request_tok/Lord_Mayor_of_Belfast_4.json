  "/wiki/Ulster_Democratic_Party": "The Ulster Democratic Party ( UDP ) was a small loyalist political party in Northern Ireland . It was established in June 1981 as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party by the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) , to replace the New Ulster Political Research Group . The UDP name had previously been used in the 1930s by an unrelated party , which on one occasion contested Belfast Central . The party 's roots were firmly in the Protestant community of Northern Ireland , but its initial political stance was not the traditional unionist one favoured by that section of society . Instead , it supported independence for Northern Ireland within the European Economic Community and the Commonwealth . These policies had been set out by its predecessors in the New Ulster Political Research Group , in their Beyond the Religious Divide policy document . However , this position did not capture the electorate 's imagination , and the UDP switched to supporting the UDA 's Common Sense position , which suggested an assembly and executive for the region , elected by proportional representation . It also supported a written Bill of Rights and Constitution . In the early years the party 's electoral support was limited . Its first foray into electoral politics was deeply disappointing , with the party leader John McMichael polling only 576 votes ( 1.3 % ) in the 1982 Belfast South by-election . The party 's two candidates in the 1982 Assembly election in Belfast North similarly failed to make an impact . It was not until the 1989 local elections that the party made its electoral breakthrough , when Ken Kerr won a seat on Derry City Council , in the Waterside area",

  "/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party": "The Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland . Having gathered support in Northern Ireland during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries , the party governed Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972 . It was supported by most unionist voters throughout the conflict known as the Troubles , during which time it was often referred to as the Official Unionist Party ( OUP ) . Between 1905 and 1972 its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster , considered as part of the Conservative Party . It is currently the fourth-largest party in Northern Ireland , having been overtaken in 2003 by the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) and Sinn F\u00e9in , and in 2017 by the Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SDLP ) . The party has been unrepresented in Westminster since losing its two seats in 2017 . Most recently , the party won 11.7 % of the vote in Northern Ireland and no seats in 2019 , placing fifth behind the DUP , Sinn F\u00e9in , Alliance Party of Northern Ireland , and SDLP . In 2016 , the UUP and the SDLP decided not to accept the seats on the Northern Ireland Executive to which they would have been entitled and to form an official opposition to the executive . This marked the first time that a devolved government in Northern Ireland did not include the UUP . Steve Aiken succeeded Robin Swann as leader , in November 2019",

The original Sinn F\u00e9in organisation was founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith , but has split substantially on a number of occasions since then - notably giving rise to the two traditionally dominant parties of southern Irish politics - Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael - in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War . The party took its current form in 1970 after another split ( with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers ' Party of Ireland ) . It has historically been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . Mary Lou McDonald became party president in February 2018 . Sinn F\u00e9in is one of the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly , winning just one seat less than the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) at the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election . In that assembly it is the largest Irish nationalist party , and it holds four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive as of 2020 [ update ] . In the UK House of Commons , Sinn F\u00e9in holds seven of Northern Ireland 's 18 seats , making it the second-largest bloc after the DUP ; there it follows a policy of abstentionism , refusing to sit in parliament or vote on bills .

The SDLP currently has 12 MLAs in the Northern Ireland Assembly and two MPs in Westminster . The SDLP party platform advocates Irish reunification , and the further devolution of powers while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom . During the Troubles , the SDLP was the most popular Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland , but since the Provisional IRA ceasefire in 1994 , it has lost ground to the republican party Sinn F\u00e9in , which in 2001 became the more popular of the two parties for the first time . Established during the Troubles , a significant difference between the two parties was the SDLP 's rejection of violence , in contrast to Sinn F\u00e9in 's support for the Provisional IRA and physical force republicanism .

  "/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party": "The Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland favouring British identity .

Now led by Arlene Foster , it is equal with Sinn F\u00e9in in having the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly , and it is the fifth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom . The DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster , the church Paisley founded . During the Troubles , the DUP were opposed to power-sharing with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict , and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs . It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 , the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 , and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 . In 2006 , the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and agreed to share power with the republican party Sinn Fein who agreed to support the Police Service , courts , and rule of law . The party has been linked to various loyalist paramilitary groups , namely Ulster Resistance ( URM ) and Third Force . The URM was formed on 10 November 1986 by DUP politicians Paisley , Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster , with the stated aim to take direct action as and when required to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism . Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined . The following year , the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland , which were shared out between the URM , the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) and the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) . In 1989 , URM members attempted to trade Shorts ' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime",
