  "/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals": "The Kansas City Royals are an American professional baseball team based in Kansas City , Missouri . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member team of the American League ( AL ) Central division . The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1969 , and has participated in four World Series , winning in 1985 and 2015 , and losing in 1980 and 2014 . The name Royals pays homage to the American Royal , a livestock show , horse show , rodeo , and championship barbeque competition held annually in Kansas City since 1899 as well as the identical names of two former negro league baseball teams that played in the first half of the 20th century ( one a semi-pro team based in Kansas City in the 1910s and 1920s that toured the Midwest and a California Winter League team based in Los Angeles in the 1940s that was managed by Chet Brewer and included Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson on its roster ) . The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",
  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",
  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",
  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/Runs_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",

  "/wiki/Graig_Nettles": "Graig Nettles ( born August 20 , 1944 ) , nicknamed Puff , is an American former Major League Baseball third baseman . During a 22-year baseball career , he played for the Minnesota Twins ( 1967-1969 ) , Cleveland Indians ( 1970-1972 ) , New York Yankees ( 1973-1983 ) , San Diego Padres ( 1984-1986 ) , Atlanta Braves ( 1987 ) , and Montreal Expos ( 1988 ) . Nettles was one of the best defensive third basemen of all time , and despite his relatively low career batting average , he was an excellent offensive contributor , setting an American League record for career home runs by a third baseman . As a part of four pennant-winning Yankee teams , Nettles enjoyed his best season in 1977 when he won the Gold Glove Award and had career-highs in home runs ( 37 ) and runs batted in ( 107 ) in leading the Yankees to the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Yankees": "The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City , the other being the National League 's ( NL ) New York Mets . The Yankees began play in the 1901 season as the Baltimore Orioles ( no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles ) . In 1903 , Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise after it ceased operations and moved it to New York City , renaming the club the New York Highlanders . The Highlanders were officially renamed the New York Yankees in 1913 . The team is owned by Yankee Global Enterprises , an LLC that is controlled by the family of the late George Steinbrenner , who purchased the team in 1973 . Brian Cashman is the team 's general manager , and Aaron Boone is the team 's field manager . The team 's home games were played at the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008 . In 1974 and 1975 , the Yankees shared Shea Stadium with the Mets , in addition to the New York Jets and the New York Giants . In 2009 , they moved into a new ballpark of the same name that was constructed adjacent to the previous facility , which was closed and demolished . The team is perennially among the leaders in MLB attendance .",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/Extra-base_hit": "In baseball , an extra-base hit ( EB , EBH or XBH ) , also known as a long hit , is any base hit on which the batter is able to advance past first base without the benefit of a fielder either committing an error or opting to make a throw to retire another base runner ( see fielder 's choice ) . Extra-base hits are often not listed separately in tables of baseball statistics , but are easily determined by calculating the sum total of a batter 's doubles , triples , and home runs . Another related statistic of interest that can be calculated is extra bases on long hits . A batter gets three of these for each home run , two for each triple , and one for each double . Thus , leading the league in Most extra bases in long hits is a significant accomplishment in power hitting . The statistic Extra-Base Hits Allowed ( for example by a pitcher or by the fielding team in general ) is denoted by the abbreviation XBA .",

Milwaukee won the series three games to two to advance to the franchise 's first World Series , where they would lose to the St. Louis Cardinals , four games to three . The 1982 ALCS was marked by a dramatic comeback by the Brewers , who lost the first two games of the series and were trailing late in the final game . This is also the first of only two Championship Series between Milwaukee and a Los Angeles team , the other being 2018 . The series was noteworthy as being the first to feature a matchup between two expansion teams ( i.e. , franchises not included among the sixteen operating in the major leagues for most of the first half of the twentieth century ) , for featuring two teams that had never before won a pennant , and for being the first time a team came from a 2-0 deficit to win the series .

Autry was a famous singing cowboy actor in a series of films in the 1930s to 1950s , and later was the subject of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum . The Angels name was taken by Autry in tribute to the previous original Los Angeles Angels , a Minor League franchise in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) , which played in South Central Los Angeles from 1903 to 1957 . He bought the rights to the Angels name from Walter O'Malley , the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner , who acquired the PCL franchise from Philip K.

  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball , farthest from the batter . These defenders are the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder . As an outfielder , their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances , if there is any runners on the bases . As an outfielder , they normally play behind the six players located in the field . By convention , each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered . The outfield positions are 7 ( left field ) , 8 ( center field ) and 9 ( right field ) . These numbers are shorthand designations useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the squad numbers worn on player uniforms .

  "/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles": "The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore , Maryland . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . As one of the American League 's eight charter teams in 1901 , this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis , Missouri , to become the St. Louis Browns in 1902 . After 52 years in St. Louis , the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro , Jr . The team 's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos . The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland ; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore , including another AL charter member franchise also named the Baltimore Orioles , which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the New York Yankees . Nicknames for the team include the O 's and the Birds . The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six World Series appearances , winning three of them ( 1966 , 1970 , 1983 ) . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles , such as third baseman Brooks Robinson , outfielder Frank Robinson , starting pitcher Jim Palmer , first baseman Eddie Murray , shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , and manager Earl Weaver .

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher . Occasionally , an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings , and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher .",
  "/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",
  "/wiki/Games_started": "In baseball statistics , games started ( denoted by GS ) indicates the number of games that a pitcher has started for his team . A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing batter . If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team 's pitcher , but is replaced before facing an opposing batter , the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started ; there have been instances in major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury , perhaps suffered while batting or running the bases during the top half of the first inning . The all-time leader for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career . The players with the most starts in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White , each with 75 games started . For position players , games started is also used to denote the number of times their names appear in a team 's starting lineup during the season .",

  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball , innings pitched ( IP ) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed , measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game . Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched . One out counts as one-third of an inning , and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning . Sometimes , the statistic is written 34.1 , 72.2 , or 91.0 , for example , to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings , \u200b72 2\u20443 innings , and 91 innings exactly , respectively . Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched . It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game , give up several hits and possibly even several runs , and be removed before achieving any outs , thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched . Alternatively , it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs .

A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

In addition , they won the 1904 American League pennant , but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series . Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .",

  "/wiki/Relief_pitcher": "In baseball and softball , a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury , ineffectiveness , fatigue , ejection , or for other strategic reasons , such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions . Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles , such as closers , setup men , middle relief pitchers , left/right-handed specialists , and long relievers . Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown , relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched . A team 's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team 's bullpen , which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games , and where they warm-up prior to entering the game .",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",

Nicknamed the Man of Steal , he is widely regarded as baseball 's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner .

  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 .

  "/wiki/Earned_run": "In baseball , an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team 's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team . Conversely , an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense . An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game . However , it is unearned in that it was , in a sense , given away by the defensive team . Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher 's statistics . However , earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher 's earned run average ( ERA ) , the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e. , averaged over a regulation game ) . Thus , in effect , the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs , while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team . To determine whether a run is earned , the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls .",
  "/wiki/Inning": "An inning in baseball , softball , and similar games is the basic unit of play , consisting of two halves or frames , the top ( first half ) and the bottom ( second half ) . In each half , one team bats until three outs are made , with the other team playing defense . A full baseball game typically is scheduled for nine innings , while softball games consist of seven innings ; although this may be shortened due to weather or extended if the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings . Inning , in baseball and softball , is always singular , which contrasts with cricket and rounders in which the singular is innings .",
  "/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched": "In baseball statistics , walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) is a sabermetric measurement of the number of baserunners a pitcher has allowed per inning pitched . WHIP is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits allowed and dividing this sum by the number of innings pitched . WHIP reflects a pitcher 's propensity for allowing batters to reach base , therefore a lower WHIP indicates better performance . While earned run average ( ERA ) measures the runs a pitcher gives up , WHIP more directly measures a pitcher 's effectiveness against batters . WHIP accounts for pitcher performance regardless of errors and unearned runs . On-base plus slugging , or OPS , a comparable measurement of the ability of a hitter , is another example of comparison .",
