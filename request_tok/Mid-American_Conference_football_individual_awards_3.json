Miami was able to hold , snapping Nebraska 's 22-game winning streak and launching Miami as a powerhouse program . This Miami team was the first to win a national title without a single player voted to the first team All-Americans and only the second to win a national title gaining more passing yards than rushing .

Both the Miami Hurricanes and the Washington Huskies finished the season undefeated ( 12-0 ) and with the top ranking in a nationally recognized poll . Under the conference-bowl selection alignments of the time , the Hurricanes and Huskies could not meet in a decisive title game because Washington was slotted into the Rose Bowl as the Pac-10 champions , and the other spot in the Rose Bowl was automatically given to the Big Ten champions ( Michigan ) . The Rose Bowl 's selection terms later thwarted potential title matchups of undefeated teams following the 1994 and 1997 seasons .

Nebraska , who finished the season undefeated , ended the year ranked No . 1 in both the Associated Press and Coaches polls . This was the first national championship of coach Tom Osborne 's career at Nebraska , despite coming close in two prior attempts ; in 1983 , his team lost to Miami after Osborne , with his team trailing 31-30 late in the game , elected to try for the lead instead of the tie and failed . In the previous season , Osborne 's team lost to eventual national champion Florida State on a missed field goal as time expired . Although Osborne 's team finished the season unbeaten , the national championship picture again was engulfed in controversy . For much of the second half of the season , Nebraska and Penn State were regarded as the top two teams in the country . This raised the possibility of a split national championship for the third time since 1990 , due in large part to the system in place that had been concocted to avoid a split title . Following the 1991 season , where Miami and Washington split the national championship in the AP and Coaches ' polls , the Bowl Coalition was founded . The Coalition consisted of six bowls , with the Orange , Fiesta , Cotton , and Sugar bowls were all considered potential hosts for a national championship game . Since three of these bowls already had specific tie-ins with conferences , an agreement was struck where the conferences would agree to release those teams from their contractual obligations in order to achieve a # 1 vs # 2 matchup .

This was a dominant Nebraska team , averaging 52 points per game and a 39-point average margin of victory , including a 62-24 victory over Florida . This lopsided victory came after Florida was picked by many sportswriters to win the game . Ohio State almost created a national title controversy , going into its final regular season game against Michigan undefeated and ranked # 2 .

Were it not for Texas beating Nebraska , then # 3 , in the first ever Big 12 Championship Game , Florida would n't have even been in the bowl game .

But Ohio State 's backup quarterback Joe Germaine marched down the field to pull out a heart stopping 20-17 win . On the one hand , this meant the national title game the following night would produce an incontrovertible champion .

The Nebraska Cornhuskers garnered the top ranking in the Coaches ' Poll with a 13-0 record , a Big 12 Conference championship , and a win over Tennessee in the Orange Bowl . Michigan 's Charles Woodson , who played primarily at cornerback , but also saw time on offense as a wide receiver and on special teams as a punt returner , won the Heisman Trophy , becoming the first primarily defensive player to win the award . The 1997 season was the third and final season in which the major bowl games were organized under the Bowl Alliance system . The Bowl Championship Series was instituted the following year . In Tom Osborne 's last season as head coach , Nebraska took over the # 1 ranking in the nation after defeating Texas Tech midway through the season . Three weeks later , despite winning at Missouri in an overtime game against an unranked Missouri football team , Nebraska slipped to a # 2 ranking in the polls , as voters were n't impressed by the way the Cornhuskers won the game ( a controversial kicked ball that was caught for the game-tying TD as time expired in regulation ) ; Michigan moved ahead of Nebraska after its 34-8 victory over # 3 ranked Penn State . The consensus # 1 team going into the bowl season was undefeated Michigan , ranked # 1 in both the AP and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll . Led by coach of the year Lloyd Carr and Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson , Michigan went into the 1998 Rose Bowl against # 8 Washington State . Michigan defeated Washington State 21-16",
  "/wiki/1998_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season , play of college football in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I-A level , began in late summer 1998 and culminated with the major bowl games in early January 1999 . It was the first season of the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) , which saw the Tennessee Volunteers win the national championship , one year after star quarterback Peyton Manning left for the National Football League ( NFL ) . Tennessee defeated the Florida State Seminoles , 23-16 , in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Arizona , to secure the inaugural BCS National Championship . The BCS combined elements of the old Bowl Coalition and the Bowl Alliance it replaced . The agreement existed between the Rose , Fiesta , Sugar , and Orange bowl games , with the Cotton Bowl Classic diminishing in status since the breakup of the Southwest Conference . Like the Bowl Alliance , a national championship game would rotate between the four bowls , with the top two teams facing each other . These teams were chosen based upon a BCS poll , combining the AP Poll , the Coaches Poll , and a computer component . The computer factored in things such as strength of schedule , margin of victory , and quality wins without taking into account time ( in other words , a loss early in the season and a loss late in the season were on equal footing ) . Like the Bowl Coalition , the BCS bowls not hosting the national championship game would retain their traditional conference tie-ins . The first run of the Bowl Championship Series was not without controversy as Kansas State finished third in the final BCS standings , but was not invited to a BCS bowl game . Ohio State ( ranked 4th ) and two-loss Florida ( 8th ) received the at-large bids instead . Also , Tulane went undefeated , but finished 10th in the BCS standings and was not invited to a BCS bowl because of their low strength of schedule",
  "/wiki/1999_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1999 NCAA Division I-A football season saw Florida State named national champions , defeating Virginia Tech in the BCS Sugar Bowl . Florida State became the first team in history to start out preseason # 1 and remain there through the entire season . Their 12-0 season gave them 109 victories in the '90s , the most for any decade . Virginia Tech also had a remarkable season behind freshman quarterback Michael Vick , who was being touted as college football 's best player . Vick was outshined in the national championship game by Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick . Warrick had early problems with the law , charged with a misdemeanor he sat out two games early in the season . But he scored three touchdowns in the title game , earning MVP honors . The BCS adopted a new rule after the previous season , nicknamed the Kansas State Rule , which stated that any team ranked in the top four in the final BCS poll is assured of an invitation to a BCS bowl game . A lot of teams faced debacles . East Carolina faced Hurricane Floyd , and in that same week , faced the # 9 Miami Hurricanes . The Pirates were down , 23-3 , but scored 24 unanswered points to win the football game , 27-23 . Kansas State finished 6th in the BCS standings but again received no BCS bowl invitation , this time being passed over in favor of Michigan ( ranked 8th )",

  "/wiki/2000_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 2000 NCAA Division I-A football season ended with the Oklahoma Sooners claiming their first national championship and their first conference championship since the departure of head coach Barry Switzer . Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops was in his second season as head coach , having been the defensive coordinator of Steve Spurrier 's 1996 National Champion Florida Gators , and also having helped Bill Snyder turn the Kansas State Wildcats around in the early 1990s . Stoops erased a three-game losing streak against rival Texas by a score of 63-14 , one of the worst defeats in Texas ' football history . Despite the lopsided victory , this game marked a return of the Red River Shootout to a rivalry game with national title implications . The BCS title game was not without controversy , as the system shut fourth-ranked Washington out of the championship game , despite being the only team who had beaten each # 2 Miami and # 5 Oregon State and having the same 10-1 record as # 3 Florida State during the regular season . 10-1 Miami , who handed # 3 Florida State their only loss , was ranked higher in both the AP Writers ' Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches ' Poll , and had the same record as the Seminoles , was also seen as a possible title contender .

Two new bowl games began in the 2000 season : the Silicon Valley Bowl , which had a contractual tie-in with the WAC , and the Galleryfurniture.com Bowl",
