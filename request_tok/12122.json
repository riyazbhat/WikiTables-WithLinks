  "/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch": "Ferdinand Foch ( French : [ f\u0254\u0283 ] ; 2 October 1851 - 20 March 1929 ) was a French general and military theorist who served as the Supreme Allied Commander during the First World War . An aggressive , even reckless commander at the First Marne , Flanders , and Artois campaigns of 1914-1916 , Foch became the Allied Commander-in-Chief in late March 1918 in the face of the all-out German spring offensive , which pushed the Allies back using fresh soldiers and new tactics that trenches could not contain . He successfully coordinated the French , British and American efforts into a coherent whole , deftly handling his strategic reserves . He stopped the German offensive and launched a war-winning counterattack . In November 1918 , Marshal Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities and was present at the armistice of 11 November 1918 . At the outbreak of war in August 1914 , Foch 's XX Corps participated in the brief invasion of Germany before retreating in the face of a German counter-attack and successfully blocking the Germans short of Nancy . Ordered west to defend Paris , Foch 's prestige soared as a result of the victory at the Marne , for which he was widely credited as a chief protagonist while commanding the French Ninth Army . He was then promoted again to Assistant Commander-in-Chief for the Northern Zone , a role which evolved into command of Army Group North , and in which role he was required to cooperate with the British forces at Ypres and the Somme . At the end of 1916 , partly owing to the disappointing results of the latter offensive and partly owing to wartime political rivalries , Foch was transferred to Italy . Foch was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on 26 March 1918 following being the Commander-in-Chief of Western Front with the title G\u00e9n\u00e9ralissime in 1918 . He played a decisive role in halting a renewed German advance on Paris in the Second Battle of the Marne , after which he was promoted to Marshal of France . Addington says , to a large extent the final Allied strategy which won the war on land in Western Europe in 1918 was Foch 's alone .",

The town was fought over during both World Wars , suffering much damage , and occupied several times by both sides . The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which led directly to the Armistice with Germany . Heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War , the city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau 's plans with wider streets to ease traffic congestion . These newer structures were primarily built of brick , concrete and white stone with slate roofs . The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret .

In France , Hugo is known primarily for his poetry collections , such as Les Contemplations ( The Contemplations ) and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles ( The Legend of the Ages ) . Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani . Many of his works have inspired music , both during his lifetime and after his death , including the musicals Les Mis\u00e9rables and Notre-Dame de Paris . He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime , and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment . Though a committed royalist when he was young , Hugo 's views changed as the decades passed , and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism ; his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time . He is buried in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris . His legacy has been honoured in many ways , including his portrait being placed on French currency .",

It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west . The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and had reached the eastern outskirts of Paris . A counter-attack by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) along the Marne River forced the Imperial German Army to retreat northwest , leading to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea . The battle was a victory for the Allied Powers but led to four years of trench warfare stalemate on the Western Front . The battle of the Marne was a turning point of World War I . By the end of August 1914 , the whole Allied army on the Western Front had been forced into a general retreat back towards Paris . Meanwhile , the two main German armies continued through France . It seemed that Paris would be taken as both the French and the British fell back towards the Marne River . The war became a stalemate when the Allied Powers won the Battle of the Marne . It was the first major clash on the Western Front and one of the most important events in the war . The German retreat left the Schlieffen Plan in ruins and Germany had no hope of a quick victory in France .",

The battle was the longest of the First World War and took place on the hills north of Verdun-sur-Meuse . The German 5th Army attacked the defences of the Fortified Region of Verdun ( RFV , R\u00e9gion Fortifi\u00e9e de Verdun ) and those of the French Second Army on the right ( east ) bank of the Meuse . Using the experience of the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915 , the Germans planned to capture the Meuse Heights , an excellent defensive position with good observation for artillery-fire on Verdun . The Germans hoped that the French would commit their strategic reserve to recapture the position and suffer catastrophic losses at little cost to the Germans . Poor weather delayed the beginning of the attack until 21 February but the Germans captured Fort Douaumont in the first three days . The advance then slowed for several days , despite inflicting many French casualties . By 6 March , \u200b20 1\u20442 French divisions were in the RFV and a more extensive defence in depth had been constructed . Philippe P\u00e9tain ordered no retreat and that German attacks were to be counter-attacked , despite this exposing French infantry to German artillery-fire . By 29 March , French guns on the west bank had begun a constant bombardment of Germans on the east bank , causing many infantry casualties . The German offensive was extended to the left ( west ) bank of the Meuse , to gain observation and eliminate the French artillery firing over the river but the attacks failed to reach their objectives . In early May , the Germans changed tactics again and made local attacks and counter-attacks ; the French recaptured part of Fort Douaumont but then the Germans ejected them and took many prisoners .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme": "The Battle of the Somme , also known as the Somme Offensive , was a battle of the First World War fought by the armies of the British Empire and French Third Republic against the German Empire . It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the River Somme in France . The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies and was the largest battle of the war 's Western Front . More than three million men fought in the battle and one million men were wounded or killed , making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history . The French and British had committed themselves to an offensive on the Somme during Allied discussions at Chantilly , Oise , in December 1915 . The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 , by the French , Russian , British and Italian armies , with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution . Initial plans called for the French army to undertake the main part of the Somme offensive , supported on the northern flank by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . When the Imperial German Army began the Battle of Verdun on the Meuse on 21 February 1916 , French commanders diverted many of the divisions intended for the Somme and the supporting attack by the British became the principal effort . The British troops on the Somme comprised a mixture of the remains of the pre-war regular army ; the Territorial Force ; and Kitchener 's Army , a force of volunteer recruits . The first day on the Somme ( 1 July ) saw a serious defeat for the German Second Army , which was forced out of its first position by the French Sixth Army , from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank , and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert-Bapaume road . This first day was , in terms of casualties , also the worst day in the history of the British Army , which suffered 57,470 casualties , including 19,240 killed in action . These occurred mainly on the front between the Albert-Bapaume road and Gommecourt , where the attack was defeated and few British troops reached the German front line .",

The front line was held by a large Belgian force , which halted the German advance in a costly defensive battle . The Allied victory at the Yser stopped the German advance into the last corner of unoccupied Belgium but the German army was still left in control of 95 percent of Belgian territory . The victory at the Yser allowed Belgium to retain a sliver of territory , which made King Albert a Belgian national hero , sustained national pride and provided a venue for commemorations of heroic sacrifice for the next century .",

  "/wiki/Franco-Prussian_war": "The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War [ a ] , often referred to in France as the War of 1870 , was a conflict between the Second French Empire ( and later , the Third French Republic ) and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia . Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871 , the conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded . Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to draw the independent southern German states - Baden , W\u00fcrttemberg , Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt - into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia , while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded . None , however , dispute the fact that Bismarck must have recognized the potential for new German alliances , given the situation as a whole . France mobilised its army on 15 July 1870 , leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day . On 16 July 1870 , the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia , and the declaration of war was delivered to Prussia three days later . French forces invaded German territory on 2 August . The German coalition mobilised its troops much more effectively than the French and invaded northeastern France on 4 August . The German forces were superior in numbers , had better training and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology , particularly railroads and artillery . A series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France , culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan , saw French Emperor Napoleon III captured and the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated . A Government of National Defence declared the Third French Republic in Paris on 4 September and continued the war for another five months ; the German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France . The capital of Paris was besieged , and fell on 28 January 1871 , after which a revolutionary uprising called the Paris Commune seized power in the city and held it for two months , until it was bloodily suppressed by the regular French army at the end of May 1871 .",

  "/wiki/Cr\u00e9cy": "The Battle of Cr\u00e9cy took place on 26 August 1346 in north-east France between a French army commanded by King Philip VI and an English army led by King Edward III . The French attacked the English while they were traversing northern France during the Hundred Years ' War resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French . The English army had landed in the Cotentin Peninsula on 12 July . It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within 2 miles ( 3 km ) of Paris , sacking many towns on the way . The English then marched north , hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from Flanders . Hearing that the Flemish had turned back , and having temporarily outdistanced the pursuing French , Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu . Late on 26 August the French army , which greatly outnumbered the English , attacked . During a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary crossbowmen was routed by Welsh and English longbowmen . The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted knights . These were disordered by their impromptu nature , by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen , by the muddy ground , by having to charge uphill , and by the pits dug by the English . The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English archers , which caused heavy casualties . By the time the French charges reached the English men-at-arms , who had dismounted for the battle , they had lost much of their impetus .",

He reigned from 1328 until his death . Philip 's reign was dominated by the consequences of a succession dispute . When King Charles IV died in 1328 , the nearest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England , but the French nobility preferred Charles 's paternal cousin Philip . At first , Edward seemed to accept Philip 's succession , but he pressed his claim to the throne of France after a series of disagreements with Philip . The result was the beginning of the Hundred Years ' War in 1337 . After initial successes at sea , Philip 's navy was annihilated at the Battle of Sluys in 1340 , ensuring that the war would occur on the continent . The English took another decisive advantage at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy ( 1346 ) , while the Black Death struck France , further destabilizing the country . In 1349 , Philip VI bought the Dauphin\u00e9 from its ruined ruler Humbert II and entrusted the government of this province to his grandson Charles .

  "/wiki/King_Edward_III_of_England": "Edward III ( 13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377 ) was king of England and Lord of Ireland from January 1327 until his death . He was the seventh king of the House of Plantagenet . He is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father , Edward II . Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe . His long reign of 50 years was the second-longest in medieval England ( after that of his great-grandfather Henry III ) and saw vital developments in legislation and government , in particular the evolution of the English Parliament , as well as the ravages of the Black Death . Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother , Isabella of France , and her lover Roger Mortimer . At age seventeen he led a successful coup d'\u00e9tat against Mortimer , the de facto ruler of the country , and began his personal reign . After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 . This started what became known as the Hundred Years ' War . Following some initial setbacks , this first phase of the war went exceptionally well for England ; victories at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny , in which England made territorial gains , and Edward renounced his claim to the French throne . This phase would become known as the Edwardian War . Edward 's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife , largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health .",
  "/wiki/Hundred_Years_War": "The Hundred Years ' War was a series of conflicts from 1337 to 1453 , waged between the House of Plantagenet , rulers of England and the French House of Valois , over the right to rule the Kingdom of France . Each side drew many allies into the war . It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages , in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe . The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline , and the development of strong national identities in both countries . Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family , which was French ( Norman , and later , Angevin ) in origin . English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France , which made them vassals to the kings of France . The status of the English king 's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages . French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power , stripping away lands as the opportunity arose , particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland , an ally of France . English holdings in France had varied in size , at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain ; by 1337 , however , only Gascony was English . In 1328 , Charles IV of France died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession . Charles 's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England , whose mother , Isabella of France , was Charles 's sister .

She was born to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Rom\u00e9e , a peasant family , at Domr\u00e9my in northeast France . Joan claimed to have received visions of the archangel Michael , Saint Margaret , and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years ' War . The unanointed King Charles VII sent Joan to the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans as part of a relief army . She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later . Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII 's consecration at Reims . This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory . On 23 May 1430 , she was captured at Compi\u00e8gne by the Burgundian faction , a group of French nobles allied with the English . She was later handed over to the English and put on trial by the pro-English bishop Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges . After Cauchon declared her guilty , she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431 , dying at about nineteen years of age . In 1456 , an inquisitorial court authorized by Pope Callixtus III examined the trial , debunked the charges against her , pronounced her innocent , and declared her a martyr .

Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe , where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism . His reputation was markedly different in Anglophone regions where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children 's books , largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed ( until the 1980s , when his literary reputation ... began to improve ) .

K\u014dnstantino\u00fapolis ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) ) ; Latin : C\u014dnstant\u012bnopolis ) was the capital city of the Roman Empire ( 330-395 ) , of the Eastern Roman ( Byzantine ) Empire ( 395-1204 and 1261-1453 ) , of the brief Crusader state known as the Latin Empire ( 1204-1261 ) and of the Ottoman Empire ( 1453-1923 ) . In 1923 the capital of Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , was moved to Ankara and the name Constantinople was officially changed to Istanbul ; the city is still referred to as Constantinople in Greek-speaking sources . The city is located in what is now the European side and the core of modern Istanbul . In 324 the ancient city of Byzantium became the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great , after whom it was renamed , and dedicated on 11 May 330 . From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century , Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe . The city became famous for its architectural masterpieces , such as Hagia Sophia , the cathedral of the Eastern Orthodox Church , which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate , the sacred Imperial Palace where the Emperors lived , the Galata Tower , the Hippodrome , the Golden Gate of the Land Walls , and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares . The University of Constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453 , including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had over 100,000 volumes of ancient texts . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and as the guardian of Christendom 's holiest relics such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross .",
  "/wiki/Crusades": "The crusades were a series of religious wars in Europe and western Asia initiated , supported and sometimes directed by the Catholic Church between the 11th and the 17th centuries . The crusades differed from other religious conflicts in that participants considered them a penitential exercise that brought absolution . Historians contest the definition of the term crusade with some restricting it to armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem ; others including all Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefits ; all Catholic holy wars ; or those with characteristic religious fervour . The most well known are those fought against the Muslims of the eastern Mediterranean for the Holy Land between 1096 and 1271 . Crusades were also fought from the 12th century against the Iberian Moors , the Ottoman Empire and in several other regions . The reasons for thesse included fighting pagans , the suppression of heresy and conflict between Catholic groups . In 1095 Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont . He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem . There was an enthusiastic response in western European across all social strata . Historians debate the combination of motivations of the volunteers who took a public vow to join the crusade - the prospect of mass ascension into Heaven at Jerusalem , satisfying feudal obligations , opportunities for renown , economic and political advantage are all considered . Four Crusader states were established in the Near East : the County of Edessa ; the Principality of Antioch ; the Kingdom of Jerusalem ; and the County of Tripoli . A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until Acre , the last mainland outpost , fell in 1291 , after which there were no further crusades to recover the Holy Land .",

  "/wiki/Rue": "Ruta graveolens [ L. strong smelling rue ] , commonly known as rue , common rue or herb-of-grace , is a species of Ruta grown as an ornamental plant and herb .

It is also cultivated as a medicinal herb , as a condiment , and to a lesser extent as an insect repellent .",
  "/wiki/Siege_tower": "A siege tower or breaching tower ( or in the Middle Ages , a belfry ) is a specialized siege engine , constructed to protect assailants and ladders while approaching the defensive walls of a fortification . The tower was often rectangular with four wheels with its height roughly equal to that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers to stand on top of the tower and shoot arrows into the fortification . Because the towers were wooden and thus flammable , they had to have some non-flammable covering of iron or fresh animal skins . Used since the 11th century BC by the Babylonians and Assyrians in the ancient Near East , the 4th century BC in Europe and also in antiquity in the Far East , siege towers were of unwieldy dimensions and , like trebuchets , were therefore mostly constructed on site of the siege . Taking considerable time to construct , siege towers were mainly built if the defense of the opposing fortification could not be overcome by ladder assault ( escalade ) , by mining or by breaking walls or gates . The siege tower sometimes housed spearmen , pikemen , swordsmen , archers or crossbowmen who shot arrows and quarrels at the defenders . Because of the size of the tower it would often be the first target of large stone catapults but it had its own projectiles with which to retaliate . Siege towers were used to get troops over an enemy curtain wall . When a siege tower was near a wall , it would drop a gangplank between it and the wall . Troops could then rush onto the walls and into the castle or city .",

  "/wiki/Flamboyant": "Flamboyant ( from French flamboyant , flaming ) is the name given to a florid style of late Gothic architecture in vogue in France from about 1350 , until it was superseded by Renaissance architecture during the early 16th century . The term has been mainly used to describe French buildings and sometimes the early period of English Gothic architecture , usually called the Decorated Style ; the historian Edward Augustus Freeman proposed this in a work of 1851 . A version of the style spread to Spain and Portugal during the 15th century . It evolved from the Rayonnant style and the English Decorated Style and was marked by even greater attention to decoration and the use of double curved tracery . The term was first used by Eustache-Hyacinthe Langlois ( 1777-1837 ) , and like all the terms mentioned in this paragraph except Sondergotik describes the style of window tracery , which is much the easiest way of distinguishing within the overall Gothic period , but ignores other aspects of style . In England the later part of the period is known as Perpendicular Gothic . In Germany Sondergotik ( Special Gothic ) is the more usual term . The name derives from the flame-like windings of its tracery and the dramatic lengthening of gables and the tops of arches . A key feature is the ogee arch , originating in Beverley Minster , England around 1320 , which spread to York and Durham , although the form was never widely used in England , being superseded by the rise of the Perpendicular style around 1350 . A possible point of connection between the early English work and the later development in France is the church at Chaumont . The Manueline in Portugal , and the Isabelline in Spain were even more extravagant continuations of the style in the late 15th and early 16th centuries . In the past , the Flamboyant style , along with its antecedent Rayonnant , has frequently been disparaged by critics .",
