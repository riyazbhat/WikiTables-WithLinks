  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Inga_II": "The Inga Dams are two hydroelectric dams connected to one of the largest waterfalls in the world , Inga Falls . They are located in the western Democratic Republic of the Congo and 140 miles southwest of Kinshasa . Inga Falls on the Congo River is a group of rapids ( or cataracts ) downstream of the Livingstone Falls and the Pool Malebo . The Congo falls ~96 metres ( 315 ft ) within this set of cataracts . The mean annual flow rate of the Congo River at Inga Falls is ~42,000 cubic metres per second ( 1,500,000 cu ft/s ) . Given this flow rate and the 96 metre fall , the Inga Falls alone has a potential to generate ~39.6 gigawatts ( 53,100,000 hp ) of mechanical energy and nearly as much electrical energy . Inga Falls is currently the site of two large hydro power plants and is being considered for a much larger hydro power generating station known as Grand Inga . The Grand Inga project , if completed , would be the largest hydro-electric power generating facility in the world . The current project scope calls for the use of a flow rate ~26,400 cubic metres per second at a net head of ~150 metres ; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of ~38.9 GW . This hydro-electric generator would be more than double the current world record holder , which is the Three Gorges facility on the Yangtze River in China . Grand Inga is a run-of-the-river hydroelectric project in which only a relatively small reservoir would be created to back up the power of the river 's flow . This would be so that the net head for the hydroelectric turbines could approach 150 metres .",
  "/wiki/Run_of_river": "Run-of-river hydroelectricity ( ROR ) or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided . Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage , in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage . A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows , thus the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source . Conventional hydro uses reservoirs , which regulate water for flood control and dispatchable electrical power .",
  "/wiki/Congo_River": "The Congo River , formerly known as the Zaire River under the Mobutu regime , is the second longest river in Africa , shorter only than the Nile , as well as the second largest river in the world by discharge volume , following only the Amazon . It is also the world 's deepest recorded river , with measured depths in excess of 220 m ( 720 ft ) . The Congo-Lualaba-Chambeshi River system has an overall length of 4,700 km ( 2,920 mi ) , which makes it the world 's ninth-longest river . The Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River , and Lualaba is the name of the Congo River upstream of Boyoma Falls , extending for 1,800 km ( 1,120 mi ) . Measured along with the Lualaba , the main tributary , the Congo River has a total length of 4,370 km ( 2,715 mi ) . It is the only major river to cross the equator twice . The Congo Basin has a total area of about 4,000,000 km2 ( 1,500,000 sq mi ) , or 13 % of the entire African landmass .",

The Lualaba is 1,800 kilometres ( 1,100 mi ) long . Its headwaters are in the country 's far southeastern corner near Musofi and Lubumbashi in Katanga Province , next to Zambia .

  "/wiki/Reservoir": "A reservoir ( from French r\u00e9servoir - a tank ) is , most commonly , an enlarged natural or artificial lake , pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water . Reservoirs can be created in a number of ways , including controlling a watercourse that drains an existing body of water , interrupting a watercourse to form an embayment within it , through excavation , or building any number of retaining walls or levees . Defined as a storage space for fluids , reservoirs may hold water or gasses , including hydrocarbons . Tank reservoirs store these in ground-level , elevated , or buried tanks . Tank reservoirs for water are also called cisterns . Most underground reservoirs are used to store liquids , principally either water or petroleum , below ground .",
  "/wiki/Ruzizi_River": "The Ruzizi ( also sometimes spelled Rusizi ) is a river , 117 kilometres ( 73 mi ) long , that flows from Lake Kivu to Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa , descending from about 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) to about 770 metres ( 2,530 ft ) above sea level over its length . The steepest gradients occur over the first 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) , where hydroelectric dams have been built . Further downstream , the Ruzizi Plain , the floor of the Western Rift Valley , has only gentle hills , and the river flows into Lake Tanganyika through a delta , with one or two small channels splitting off from the main channel . The Ruzizi is a young river , formed about 10,000 years ago when volcanism associated with continental rifting created the Virunga Mountains . The mountains blocked Lake Kivu 's former outlet to the watershed of the Nile and instead forced the lake overflow south down the Ruzizi and the watershed of the Congo .",
