All Finals have been played in a best-of-seven format , and are contested between the winners of the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference ( formerly Divisions before 1970 ) , except in 1950 when the Eastern Division champion faced the winner between the Western and Central Division champions . From 1946 through 1949 , when the league was known as the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) , the playoffs were a three-stage tournament where the two semifinal winners played each other in the finals . The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . The current home-and-away format in the NBA Finals is 2-2-1-1-1 ( the team with the better regular-season record plays on their home court in Games 1 , 2 , 5 , and 7 ) , which has been used in 1947-1948 , 1950-1952 , 1957-1970 , 1972-1974 , 1976-1977 , 1979-1984 , and 2014-present . It was previously in a 2-3-2 format ( the team with the better regular season record plays on their home court in Games 1 , 2 , 6 , and 7 ) during 1949 , 1953-1955 , and 1985-2013 , in a 1-1-1-1-1-1-1 format during 1956 and 1971 , and in a 1-2-2-1-1 format during 1975 and 1978 . The Eastern Conference/Division leads the Western Conference/Division in series won ( 39-34 ) .

He would be the first African-American to coach in the NBA . Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red 's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win . The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5 . However , the Lakers won the next two games , setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden .
