  "/wiki/HSL_1": "The HSL 1 ( French : Ligne \u00e0 Grande Vitesse ( LGV ) 1 , Dutch : Hogesnelheidslijn 1 , English : High-Speed Line 1 ) is a high-speed rail line which connects Brussels , Belgium , with the LGV Nord at the Belgium-France border . It is 88 km ( 55 mi ) long with 71 km of dedicated high-speed tracks and 17 km of modernised lines . Service began on 14 December 1997 . The line has appreciably shortened journey times , the journey from Paris to Brussels now taking 1:22 . In combination with the LGV Nord , it has also impacted international journeys to other cities in France and to London , ensuring high-speed through-running by Eurostar , TGV , Thalys PBA and Thalys PBKA trainsets . The total construction cost was \u20ac1.42 billion . [ citation needed ] The signalling system installed is the TVM-430 in-cab signalling system , the same as LGV Nord in France , and High Speed 1 in the UK .",
  "/wiki/LGV_Nord": "The LGV Nord ( Ligne \u00e0 Grande Vitesse ) is a French 333-kilometre ( 207 mi ) -long high-speed rail line , opened in 1993 , that connects Paris to the Belgian border and the Channel Tunnel via Lille . With a maximum speed of 300 kilometres per hour ( 190 mph ) , the line appreciably shortened rail journeys between Paris and Lille . Its extensions to the north ( Belgium , the Channel Tunnel ) and the south ( via the LGV Interconnexion Est ) have reduced journey times to Great Britain and Benelux and for inter-regional trips between the Nord ( Pas de Calais ) region and the southeast and southwest of France . Its route is twinned with the A1 for 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) . As it is mostly built in flat areas , the maximum incline is 25 metres per kilometre ( 2.5\u2030 ) . And that 's why the line was given its official nickname , The A1 Highway . Of all French high-speed lines the LGV Nord sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock : the TGV Sud-Est , TGV R\u00e9seau , TGV Atlantique , TGV Duplex , Eurostar e300 , Eurostar e320 , Thalys PBA and PBKA as well as the local trains . Traffic is controlled by the Lille rail traffic centre .",

It is located on the territory of the municipality of Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis . The Brussels-Capital Region is bilingual ; hence , both the French and Dutch names of the station are official . Outside Belgium , this often leads to the use of combined shorthands ; for example in the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable , Brussels-South is designated as Brussels Midi/Zuid ; Dutch Railways announce the station as Brussel Zuid/Midi . The station is also connected to the Gare du Midi/Zuidstation station of the Brussels Metro system . Le Midi is reference to Southern France as far end of the trains leaving the Brussels from this station .",

The line was technically completed in October 2007 ; however , it did not come into operation until 14 June 2009 , when ICE trains began service . Thalys trains have been using the line since 13 December 2009 . The gap between completion of the line and its actual use was due to difficulties in the implementation of the safety system ETCS level 2 , specifically , finding trains with ERTMS fitted . Together with the HSL 2 and HSL 1 to the French border , the combined eastward high-speed line has greatly reduced journey times between Brussels , Paris and Germany . HSL 3 has cut Li\u00e8ge - Cologne journey times from 1 h 23 min to 1 h 1 min . HSL 3 is used only by international Thalys and ICE trains , as opposed to HSL 2 , which is also used for fast internal InterCity services .",

  "/wiki/Schaarbeek": "Schaerbeek ( obsolete Dutch spelling , retained in French , pronounced [ ska\u0281bek ] ( listen ) ) or Schaarbeek ( Dutch , pronounced [ \u02c8sxa\u02d0rbe\u02d0k ] ( listen ) ) is one of the nineteen municipalities located in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium . It is bordered by the City of Brussels , Etterbeek , Evere and Saint-Josse-ten-Noode . In common with all the Brussels municipalities , it is legally bilingual ( French-Dutch ) . The eastern part of Schaerbeek ( the area that includes Vergote Square , Boulevard Lambermont , Quartier des Fleurs , Jamblinne de Meux Square , and Diamant Quarters and Josaphat Park ) is nowadays a location selected by affluent people for its architecture and its convenient location ( close to the EU institutions and the financial heart of the city , NATO , the European School , the airport and the Ring and highways ) . Young couples are also favouring this suburb for its Notting Hill atmosphere and the still reasonable pricing of real estate , while prices are on the surge as everywhere else in Brussels . This gentrification phenomenon is gradually spreading from the perimeter of the Josaphat Park , concentrically , to the surrounding streets , where artisan bakeries , delicatessens and other cheese shops or table d'h\u00f4tes have settled , the Josaphat Park , classified as the most beautiful Park in Brussels according to an RTBF consultation , clearly acting as a catalyst . The western part of Schaerbeek ( the area near the Brussels-North railway station , the Chauss\u00e9e de Haecht/Haachtsesteenweg and the Van Praet bridge ) is home to a large Turkish immigrant community , a significant part of which originates from Afyon or Emirda\u011f , Turkey . It is also home to a large Moroccan population and other immigrant communities such as Spanish , Congolese , and Asian immigrants . The area around St. Mary 's Royal Church is the part where the Turkish community gathers in Brussels , which has led the area to be dubbed Petite Anatolie because of all the Turkish restaurants and shops at the Chauss\u00e9e de Haecht/Haachtsesteenweg . However , because of the numerous schools like the Hogeschool Sint-Lukas Brussel , the administrations and the proximity of the Rue Royale there is a social mix . The Schaerbeek Cemetery , despite its name , is actually in the neighbouring municipality of Evere .",
