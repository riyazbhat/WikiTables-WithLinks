  "/wiki/Mineral_oil": "Mineral oil is any of various colorless , odorless , light mixtures of higher alkanes from a mineral source , particularly a distillate of petroleum , as distinct from usually edible vegetable oils . The name mineral oil by itself is imprecise , having been used for many specific oils over the past few centuries . Other names , similarly imprecise , include white oil , paraffin oil , liquid paraffin ( a highly refined medical grade ) , paraffinum liquidum ( Latin ) , and liquid petroleum . Baby oil is a perfumed mineral oil . Most often , mineral oil is a liquid by-product of refining crude oil to make gasoline and other petroleum products . This type of mineral oil is a transparent , colorless oil , composed mainly of alkanes and cycloalkanes , related to petroleum jelly . It has a density of around 0.8-0.87 g/cm3 .",
  "/wiki/Transformer_oil": "Transformer oil or insulating oil is an oil that is stable at high temperatures and has excellent electrical insulating properties . It is used in oil-filled transformers , some types of high-voltage capacitors , fluorescent lamp ballasts ( North America only ) , and some types of high-voltage switches and circuit breakers . Its functions are to insulate , suppress corona discharge and arcing , and to serve as a coolant . Transformer oil is most often based on mineral oil , but alternative formulations with better engineering or environmental properties are growing in popularity .",
  "/wiki/Hexane": "Hexane /\u02c8h\u025bkse\u026an/ is an alkane of six carbon atoms , with the chemical formula C6H14 . The term may refer to any of the five structural isomers with that formula , or to a mixture of them . In IUPAC nomenclature , however , hexane is the unbranched isomer ( n-hexane ) ; the other four isomers are named as methylated derivatives of pentane and butane . IUPAC also uses the term as the root of many compounds with a linear six-carbon backbone , such as 2-methylhexane . Hexanes are significant constituents of gasoline . They are all colorless liquids , odorless when pure , with boiling points between 50 and 70 \u00b0C ( 122 and 158 \u00b0F ) . They are widely used as cheap , relatively safe , largely unreactive , and easily evaporated non-polar solvents .",
  "/wiki/Heptane": "n-Heptane is the straight-chain alkane with the chemical formula H3C ( CH2 ) 5CH3 or C7H16 , and is one of the main components of gasoline ( petrol ) . When used as a test fuel component in anti-knock test engines , a 100% heptane fuel is the zero point of the octane rating scale ( the 100 point is 100% iso-octane ) . Octane number equates to the anti-knock qualities of a comparison mixture of heptane and isooctane which is expressed as the percentage of isooctane in heptane and is listed on pumps for gasoline ( petrol ) dispensed globally .",
  "/wiki/Castor_oil": "Castor oil is a vegetable oil pressed from castor beans . The name probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum . Castor oil is a colourless to very pale yellow liquid with a distinct taste and odor . Its boiling point is 313 \u00b0C ( 595 \u00b0F ) and its density is 961 kg/m3 . It is a triglyceride in which approximately 90 percent of fatty acid chains are ricinoleates . Oleate and linoleates are the other significant components . Castor oil and its derivatives are used in the manufacturing of soaps , lubricants , hydraulic and brake fluids , paints , dyes , coatings , inks , cold resistant plastics , waxes and polishes , nylon , pharmaceuticals and perfumes .",
  "/wiki/Capacitor": "A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field . It is a passive electronic component with two terminals . The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance . While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit , a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit . The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator . This name and its cognates are still widely used in many languages , but rarely in English , one notable exception being condenser microphones , also called capacitor microphones . The physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely and many types of capacitor are in common use . Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium . A conductor may be a foil , thin film , sintered bead of metal , or an electrolyte . The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor 's charge capacity . Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass , ceramic , plastic film , paper , mica , air , and oxide layers . Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices .",
  "/wiki/Silicone_oil": "A silicone oil is any liquid polymerized siloxane with organic side chains . The most important member is polydimethylsiloxane . These polymers are of commercial interest because of their relatively high thermal stability and their lubricating properties .",
  "/wiki/Global_warming_potential": "Global warming potential ( GWP ) is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere up to a specific time horizon , relative to carbon dioxide . It compares the amount of heat trapped by a certain mass of the gas in question to the amount of heat trapped by a similar mass of carbon dioxide and is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide ( whose GWP is standardized to 1 ) . A GWP is calculated over a specific time horizon , commonly 20 , 100 , or 500 years . User related choices such as the time horizon can greatly affect the numerical values obtained for carbon dioxide equivalents . In the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , methane has a lifetime of 12.4 years and with climate-carbon feedbacks a global warming potential of 86 over 20 years and 34 over 100 years in response to emissions . For a change in time horizon from 20 to 100 years , the GWP for methane therefore decreases by a factor of approximately 2.5 . The GWP depends on the following factors :",
  "/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl": "A polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) is an organic chlorine compound with the formula C12H10\u2212xClx . Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus , carbonless copy paper and in heat transfer fluids . Because of their longevity , PCBs are still widely in use , even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s , when a host of problems were identified . With the discovery of PCBs ' environmental toxicity , and classification as persistent organic pollutants , their production was banned by United States federal law in 1978 , and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001 . The International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) , rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans . According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens . Many rivers and buildings , including schools , parks , and other sites , are contaminated with PCBs and there has been contamination of food supplies with the substances . Some PCBs share a structural similarity and toxic mode of action with dioxins . Other toxic effects such as endocrine disruption ( notably blocking of thyroid system functioning ) and neurotoxicity are known . The maximum allowable contaminant level in drinking water in the United States is set at zero , but because of the limitations of water treatment technologies , a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the de facto level . The bromine analogues of PCBs are polybrominated biphenyls ( PBBs ) , which have analogous applications and environmental concerns .",
  "/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant": "Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , sometimes known as forever chemicals are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical , biological , and photolytic processes . Because of their persistence , POPs bioaccumulate with potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment . The effect of POPs on human and environmental health was discussed , with intention to eliminate or severely restrict their production , by the international community at the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001 . Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides , solvents , pharmaceuticals , and industrial chemicals . Although some POPs arise naturally , for example volcanoes and various biosynthetic pathways , most are man-made via total synthesis .",
  "/wiki/Purified_water": "Purified water is water that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use . Distilled water has been the most common form of purified water , but , in recent years , water is more frequently purified by other processes including capacitive deionization , reverse osmosis , carbon filtering , microfiltration , ultrafiltration , ultraviolet oxidation , or electrodeionization . Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce ultrapure water of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion ( ppb ) or parts per trillion ( ppt ) . Purified water has many uses , largely in the production of medications , in science and engineering laboratories and industries , and is produced in a range of purities . It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers . Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which has been treated ( rendered potable ) to neutralize , but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals .",
  "/wiki/Benzene": "Benzene is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C6H6 . The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each . As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms , benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon . Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the elementary petrochemicals . Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms , benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon , the second [ n ] -annulene ( -annulene ) . It is sometimes abbreviated PhH . Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell , and is responsible for the aroma around petrol ( gasoline ) stations . It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure , such as ethylbenzene and cumene , of which billions of kilograms are produced annually . As benzene has a high octane number , aromatic derivatives like toluene and xylene typically comprise up to 25% of gasoline ( petrol ) . Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human carcinogen . Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason .",
  "/wiki/Liquid_oxygen": "Liquid oxygen - abbreviated LOx , LOX or Lox in the aerospace , submarine and gas industries - is the liquid form of diatomic oxygen . It was used as the oxidizer in the first liquid-fueled rocket invented in 1926 by Robert H. Goddard an application which has continued to the present .",
  "/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen": "Liquid nitrogen - LN2 - is nitrogen in a liquid state at low temperature ( \u2212195.79 \u00b0C ( 77 K ; \u2212320 \u00b0F ) boiling point at sea level ) . It is produced industrially by fractional distillation of liquid air . It is a colorless , low viscosity liquid that is widely used as a coolant .",
  "/wiki/High-temperature_superconductor": "High-temperature superconductors ( abbreviated high-Tc or HTS ) are operatively defined as materials that behave as superconductors at temperatures above nearly -200 \u00b0C ( -320 \u00b0F ) . This is in fact the lowest temperature reachable by liquid nitrogen , one of the simplest coolant in cryogenics . All superconducting materials known at ordinary pressures currently work far below ambient temperatures and therefore require cooling . The majority of high-temperature superconductors are ceramics materials . On the other hand , Metallic superconductors usually work below -200 \u00b0C : they are then called low-temperature superconductors . Metallic superconductors are also ordinary superconductors , since they were discovered and used before the high-temperature ones . Ceramic superconductors are now becoming suitable for some practical use , but they still have many manufacturing issues and there are very few successful practical examples of employment . Most ceramics are brittle which makes the fabrication of wires from them very problematic . The major advantage of high-temperature ceramic superconductors is that they can be cooled by using liquid nitrogen . On the other hand , metallic superconductors require usually more difficult coolants - mostly liquid helium . Unfortunately , none of high-temperature superconductors are coolable using only dry ice , and none of them works at room temperature and pressure ( they work well below the lowest temperature recorded on Earth ) . All high-temperature superconductors require some kind of cooling systems .",
  "/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen": "Liquid hydrogen ( LH2 or LH2 ) is the liquid state of the element hydrogen . Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form . To exist as a liquid , H2 must be cooled below its critical point of 33 K. However , for it to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure , H2 needs to be cooled to 20.28 K ( \u2212252.87 \u00b0C ; \u2212423.17 \u00b0F ) . One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle . Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of hydrogen storage . As for any gas , storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure . However , the liquid density is very low compared to other common fuels . Once liquefied , it can be maintained as a liquid in pressurized and thermally insulated containers . There are two spin isomers of hydrogen ; liquid hydrogen consists of 99.79% parahydrogen and 0.21% orthohydrogen .",
  "/wiki/Liquid_helium": "At standard pressure , the chemical element helium exists in a liquid form only at the extremely low temperature of \u2212269 \u00b0C ( about 4 K or \u2212452.2 \u00b0F ) . Its boiling point and critical point depend on which isotope of helium is present : the common isotope helium-4 or the rare isotope helium-3 . These are the only two stable isotopes of helium . See the table below for the values of these physical quantities . The density of liquid helium-4 at its boiling point and a pressure of one atmosphere ( 101.3 kilopascals ) is about 0.125 grams per cm3 , or about 1/8th the density of liquid water .",
  "/wiki/Superconductor": "Superconductivity is the set of physical properties observed in certain materials , wherein electrical resistance vanishes and from which magnetic flux fields are expelled . Any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor . Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor , whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near absolute zero , a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero . An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source . This phenomenon was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8 , 1911 , in Leiden . Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines , superconductivity is a quantum mechanical mystery . It is characterized by the Meissner effect , the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state . The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity can not be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics . In 1986 , it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 K ( \u2212183 \u00b0C ) . Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor , leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors . The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K , and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures .",
  "/wiki/Argon": "Argon is a chemical element with the symbol Ar and atomic number 18 . It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas . Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth 's atmosphere , at 0.934% ( 9340 ppmv ) . It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor ( which averages about 4000 ppmv , but varies greatly ) , 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide ( 400 ppmv ) , and more than 500 times as abundant as neon ( 18 ppmv ) . Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth 's crust , comprising 0.00015% of the crust . Nearly all of the argon in the Earth 's atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40 , derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth 's crust . In the universe , argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope , as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas . The name argon is derived from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd , neuter singular form of \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 meaning lazy or inactive , as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions . The complete octet ( eight electrons ) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements . Its triple point temperature of 83.8058 K is a defining fixed point in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 . Argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air . Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive ; for example , an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning ."
