The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) originally operated the line with westbound trains heading toward Manhattan and eastbound trains heading toward Canarsie , Middle Village , or Jamaica , generally in agreement with compass direction . However , NYCT 's railroad directions , which are north and south , replaced the BMT 's west and east railroad directions , respectively . This reclassification resulted in services which ran through the BMT Nassau Street Line to Downtown Brooklyn having two south ends . To eliminate any confusion , the directions of train services in the eastern division were switched , with trains running towards Jamaica being considered Northbound . The KK ( later K ) and current M services were an exception to this , with Jamaica , Broadway Junction , or Metropolitan Avenue remaining the south terminal , since they used the Chrystie Street Connection from the Jamaica Line to the IND Sixth Avenue Line .",
