  "/wiki/1999_NHL_Entry_Draft": "The 1999 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 26 at the FleetCenter in Boston . According to Sports Illustrated and other sports news agencies , at the time the 1999 draft was considered one of the deepest in talent in years , headed by Patrik Stefan and the Sedin twins , Daniel and Henrik . As a result of the draft lottery , the first three picks going into draft day were held by the Tampa Bay Lightning , the Atlanta Thrashers expansion team , and the Vancouver Canucks , respectively . The Canucks were determined to select both Sedins and therefore initiated a trading carousel involving multiple teams . After the trading was done , the Thrashers used the first pick to select Stefan , the Canucks used the second and third picks to select the Sedins , and the Lightning traded out of the first round altogether . The overall impact in the NHL of players selected has not matched that of the neighboring drafts . An example is how many first round picks have played the equivalent of an entire regular season ten seasons after the 1999 draft ; only 16 out of 28 first round picks in 1999 have played 82 NHL games , while the same statistic applies to 23 out of 27 players in 1998 and 21 out of 30 players in 2000 .
