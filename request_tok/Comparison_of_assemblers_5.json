  "/wiki/Operating_system": "An operating system ( OS ) is system software that manages computer hardware , software resources , and provides common services for computer programs . Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time , mass storage , printing , and other resources . For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation , the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware , although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it . Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers . The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74 % . macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place ( 13.23 % ) , and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place ( 1.57 % ) . In the mobile ( including smartphones and tablets ) sector , Google Android 's share is up to 70 % in the year 2017 . According to third quarter 2016 data , Android 's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year , followed by Apple 's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent , while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent . Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors . Other specialized classes of operating systems , such as embedded and real-time systems , exist for many applications",
  "/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software": "Free and open-source software ( FOSS ) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software . [ a ] That is , anyone is freely licensed to use , copy , study , and change the software in any way , and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software . This is in contrast to proprietary software , where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users . FOSS maintains the software user 's civil liberty rights ( see the Four Essential Freedoms , below ) . Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs , increased security and stability ( especially in regard to malware ) , protecting privacy , education , and giving users more control over their own hardware . Free and open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendants of BSD are widely utilized today , powering millions of servers , desktops , smartphones ( e.g . Android ) , and other devices . Free-software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages . The free-software movement and the open-source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production and adoption of FOSS",

Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain , in which case it is also not covered by copyright and , as a result , can not be licensed . A typical software license grants the licensee , typically an end-user , permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner 's exclusive rights under copyright",
  "/wiki/A86_(software)": "A86 is computer software , a compact commercial assembler developed for the Intel x86 family of microprocessors by Eric Isaacson . It was first made available as shareware in the 1980s . The assembler is contained in one 32K executable and can directly produce an MS-DOS-compatible COM file or an object file for use with a standard linker . While still supporting expected x86 syntax , A86 allows the use of slightly simpler shorthand in some cases . It also does not require the use of directives , such as ASSUME and PROC , as do Microsoft Macro Assembler and other contemporaries . Isaacson claimed that A86 can assemble 100,000 lines of source per second on a Pentium II or better . It comes with a debugger , D86 . A86 and D86 target 16-bit x86 platforms . Isaacson added 32-bit support in the mid 1990s in the form of A386 and D386 . These were not distributed as shareware , but were provided to users who registered A86 . Isaacson never ported the A86 family of products to Windows , though it is possible to use the object files created by A386 with a Windows linker . The assembler can not be used to create 64-bit code",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms",

The ACK was originally closed-source software ( that allowed binaries to be distributed for MINIX as a special case ) , but in April 2003 it was released under an open source BSD license . It has frontends for programming languages C , Pascal , Modula-2 , Occam , and BASIC . The ACK 's notability stems from the fact that in the early 1980s it was one of the first portable compilation systems designed to support multiple source languages and target platforms . The ACK achieves maximum portability by using an intermediate language using bytecode , called EM . Each language front-end produces EM object files , which are then processed through several generic optimisers before being translated by a back-end into native machine code . ACK comes with a generic linker and librarian capable of manipulating files in the ACK 's own a.out-based format ; it will work on files containing EM code as well as native machine code . However , EM code can not be linked to native machine code without translating the EM binary first",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

  "/wiki/OS/2": "OS/2 is a series of computer operating systems , initially created by Microsoft and IBM under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci . As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft 's new Windows 3.1 operating environment , the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively . The name stands for Operating System/2 , because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM 's Personal System/2 ( PS/2 ) line of second-generation personal computers . The first version of OS/2 was released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001 . OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS . Notably , basic system calls were modeled after MS-DOS calls ; their names even started with Dos and it was possible to create Family Mode applications - text mode applications that could work on both systems . Because of this heritage , OS/2 shares similarities with Unix , Xenix , and Windows NT . IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on 31 December 2006 . Since then , it has been updated , maintained and marketed under the name eComStation . In 2015 it was announced that a new OEM distribution of OS/2 would be released that was to be called ArcaOS .

Copyleft is a form of licensing , and can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from computer software , to documents , to art , to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine . In general , copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing , adapting , or distributing copies of their work . In contrast , under copyleft , an author must give every person who receives a copy of the work permission to reproduce , adapt , or distribute it , with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing terms . Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the binaries .

Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF .

Some end-user license agreements accompany shrink-wrapped software that is presented to a user sometimes on paper or more usually electronically , during the installation procedure . The user has the choice of accepting or rejecting the agreement . The installation of the software is conditional to the user clicking a button labelled accept . See below . Many EULAs assert extensive liability limitations . Most commonly , an EULA will attempt to hold harmless the software licensor in the event that the software causes damage to the user 's computer or data , but some software also proposes limitations on whether the licensor can be held liable for damage that arises through improper use of the software ( for example , incorrectly using tax preparation software and incurring penalties as a result ) . One case upholding such limitations on consequential damages is M.A",
  "/wiki/Netwide_Assembler": "The Netwide Assembler ( NASM ) is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture . It can be used to write 16-bit , 32-bit ( IA-32 ) and 64-bit ( x86-64 ) programs . NASM is considered to be one of the most popular assemblers for Linux . NASM was originally written by Simon Tatham with assistance from Julian Hall . As of 2016 [ update ] , it is maintained by a small team led by H. Peter Anvin . It is open-source software released under the terms of a simplified ( 2-clause ) BSD license",
  "/wiki/Tim_Paterson": "Tim Paterson ( born 1 June 1956 ) is an American computer programmer , best known for creating 86-DOS , an operating system for the Intel 8086 . This system emulated the application programming interface ( API ) of CP/M , which was created by Gary Kildall . 86-DOS later formed the basis of MS-DOS , the most widely used personal computer operating system in the 1980s",
  "/wiki/86-DOS": "86-DOS is a discontinued operating system developed and marketed by Seattle Computer Products ( SCP ) for its Intel 8086-based computer kit . Initially known as QDOS ( Quick and Dirty Operating System ) , the name was changed to 86-DOS once SCP started licensing the operating system in 1980 . 86-DOS had a command structure and application programming interface that imitated that of Digital Research 's CP/M operating system , which made it easy to port programs from the latter . The system was licensed and then purchased by Microsoft and developed further as MS-DOS and PC DOS",
  "/wiki/DEBUG": "The line-oriented debugger DEBUG is an external command in operating systems such as DOS , OS/2 and Windows ( only in 16-bit/32-bit versions ) . DEBUG can act as an assembler , disassembler , or hex dump program allowing users to interactively examine memory contents ( in assembly language , hexadecimal or ASCII ) , make changes , and selectively execute COM , EXE and other file types . It also has several subcommands which are used to access specific disk sectors , I/O ports and memory addresses",
  "/wiki/Turbo_Assembler": "Turbo Assembler ( TASM ) is a computer assembler ( software for program development ) developed by Borland which runs on and produces code for 16- or 32-bit x86 DOS or Microsoft Windows . It can be used with Borland 's high-level language compilers , such as Turbo Pascal , Turbo Basic , Turbo C and Turbo C++ . The Turbo Assembler package is bundled with the Turbo Linker , and is interoperable with the Turbo Debugger . TASM can assemble Microsoft Macro Assembler ( MASM ) source using its MASM mode and has an ideal mode with a few enhancements . Object-Oriented programming has been supported since version 3.0 . The last version of Turbo Assembler is 5.4 , with files dated 1996 and patches up to 2010 ; it is still supplied with Delphi and C++Builder . TASM itself is a 16-bit program ; it will run on 16- and 32-bit versions of Windows , and produce code for the same versions . There are ways to run 16-bit programs such as TASM on 64-bit Windows ( e.g. , on a virtual machine ) , but it will not generate 64-bit Windows code . The Borland Turbo Assembler 5.0 package is supplied on three 3.5-inch diskettes and with three small books",

It is designed to work for slow computers with little disk space ( e.g . on rescue disks ) . Windows operating system support was added in version 0.9.23 ( 17 Jun 2005 ) . TCC is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License . TCC claims to implement all of ANSI C ( C89/C90 ) , much of the C99 ISO standard , and many GNU C extensions including inline assembly",
  "/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components",

  "/wiki/Xenix": "Xenix is a discontinued version of the Unix operating system for various microcomputer platforms , licensed by Microsoft from AT & T Corporation in the late 1970s . The Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) later acquired exclusive rights to the software , and eventually replaced it with SCO UNIX ( now known as SCO OpenServer ) . In the mid-to-late 1980s , Xenix was the most common Unix variant , measured according to the number of machines on which it was installed . Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said in 1996 that , for a long time , Microsoft had the highest-volume AT & T Unix license"
