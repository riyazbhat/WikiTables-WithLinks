  "/wiki/Caddo_Lake_Bridge": "The Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge , also known as the Mooringsport Bridge , is a vertical-lift bridge that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places . It was built in 1914 , to replace a ferry , by the Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City , Missouri , under authority of the Caddo Parish Police Jury . The lift span has been inoperable since the 1940s . This vehicular bridge illustrates the Vertical-Lift design of John Alexander Low Waddell of the firm of Waddell & Harrington . This design allowed the entire center span to lift in a vertical direction to allow tall oil equipment to pass through , especially Gulf Oil Company 's pile driver . This design was invented in 1893 and was successfully introduced in Chicago with the South Halsted Street Bridge . The Caddo Lake Drawbridge is a direct descendant of this structure . In the summer of 1941 , just prior to World War II , the United States Army held maneuvers in and around Mooringsport as a means of preparing the soldiers for war . During the maneuvers , Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S. Patton came to Mooringsport and led the Red and Blue armies in the capture of the bridge . They also bombed the bridge with sacks of flour . In the mid-1940s , ownership of the bridge was transferred away from Caddo Parish to the Louisiana Department of Highways ( LA Department of Transportation & Development , abbreviated as DOTD ) . Shortly after the transfer , the Department of Highways realized that there was no longer a need for the bridge to open .",

  "/wiki/Multiple_Property_Submission": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",
