  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",
  "/wiki/Babe_Ruth": "George Herman Babe Ruth Jr. ( February 6 , 1895 - August 16 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed The Bambino and The Sultan of Swat , he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage ( .690 ) , and on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the last two still stand as of 2019 [ update ] . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the Curse of the Bambino superstition .",
  "/wiki/On-base_percentage": "In baseball statistics , on-base percentage ( OBP ) , also known as on-base average/OBA , measures how frequently a batter reaches base . It is the ratio of the batter 's times-on-base ( TOB ) ( the sum of hits , walks , and times hit by pitch ) to their number of plate appearances . OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base due to fielding error , fielder 's choice , dropped/uncaught third strike , fielder 's obstruction , or catcher 's interference . An official MLB statistic since 1984 , it is sometimes referred to as on-base average/OBA , as it is rarely presented as a true percentage . On-base percentage is added to slugging average to determine on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) . The on-base percentage of all batters faced by one pitcher or team is referred to as on-base against .",
  "/wiki/Slugging_percentage": "In baseball statistics , slugging percentage ( SLG ) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter . It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats , through the following formula , where AB is the number of at bats for a given player , and 1B , 2B , 3B , and HR are the number of singles , doubles , triples , and home runs , respectively :",
  "/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging": "On-base plus slugging ( OPS ) is a sabermetric baseball statistic calculated as the sum of a player 's on-base percentage and slugging percentage . The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power , two important offensive skills , are represented . An OPS of .900 or higher in Major League Baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters . Typically , the league leader in OPS will score near , and sometimes above , the 1.000 mark .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Plate_appearances": "In baseball statistics , a player is credited with a plate appearance ( denoted by PA ) each time he completes a turn batting . Under Rule 5.04 ( c ) of the Official Baseball Rules , a player completes a turn batting when he is put out or becomes a runner . This happens when he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base ; or when he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base ( by a base on balls , hit by pitch , catcher 's interference , or obstruction ) ; or when he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely ( see also left on base , fielder 's choice , force play ) . A very similar statistic , at bats , counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances .",
  "/wiki/Derek_Jeter": "Derek Sanderson Jeter ( /\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0t\u0259r/ JEE-t\u0259r ; born June 26 , 1974 ) is an American former professional baseball shortstop , businessman , and baseball executive . He has been the chief executive officer ( CEO ) and part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) since September 2017 . As a player , Jeter spent his entire 20-year career in MLB with the New York Yankees . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2020 in his first year of eligibility ; he received 99.7% of votes , the second-highest percentage in MLB history and the highest by a position player . A five-time World Series champion , Jeter is regarded as one of the primary contributors to the Yankees ' success of the late 1990s and early 2000s for his hitting , baserunning , fielding , and leadership . He is the Yankees ' all-time career leader in hits ( 3,465 ) , doubles ( 544 ) , games played ( 2,747 ) , stolen bases ( 358 ) , times on base ( 4,716 ) , plate appearances ( 12,602 ) and at bats ( 11,195 ) . His accolades include 14 All-Star selections , five Gold Glove Awards , five Silver Slugger Awards , two Hank Aaron Awards , and a Roberto Clemente Award . Jeter was the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career ranked sixth in MLB history in career hits and first among shortstops . In 2017 , the Yankees retired his uniform number 2 . The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in 1992 , and he debuted in the major leagues at age 20 in 1995 . The following year , he became the Yankees ' starting shortstop , won the Rookie of the Year Award , and helped push the team to win the 1996 World Series . Jeter continued to play during the team 's championship seasons of 1998-2000 ; he finished third in voting for the American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award in 1998 , recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999 , and won both the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in 2000 .",
  "/wiki/At_bats": "In baseball , an at bat ( AB ) or time at bat is a batter 's turn batting against a pitcher . An at bat is different from a plate appearance . A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat , but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below . While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics , including batting average and slugging percentage , a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season . A batter will not receive credit for an at bat if their plate appearance ends under the following circumstances :",
  "/wiki/Hit_(baseball)": "In baseball statistics , a hit ( denoted by H ) , also called a base hit , is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory , without the benefit of an error or a fielder 's choice .",
  "/wiki/3,000_hit_club": "The 3,000 hit club is the group of batters who have collected 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Cap Anson was the first to do so , although his precise career hit total is unclear . [ a ] Two players - Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner - reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season . Ty Cobb became the club 's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927 ; he ultimately finished his career with 4,191 . [ b ] Pete Rose became the second player to reach 4,000 hits on April 13 , 1984 while playing for the Montreal Expos . Cobb , also the major leagues ' all-time career batting average leader , remained the MLB hit leader until September 11 , 1985 , when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit . Rose , the current record holder , finished his career with 4,256 hits . Roberto Clemente 's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits , reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career on September 30 , 1972 . [ c ] In total , 32 players have reached the 3,000 hit mark in MLB history . Of these , 17 were right-handed batters , 13 were left-handed , and two were switch hitters . Ten of these players have played for only one major league team . Six players - Hank Aaron , Willie Mays , Eddie Murray , Rafael Palmeiro , Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez - are also members of the 500 home run club .",
  "/wiki/Total_bases": "In baseball statistics , total bases is the number of bases a player has gained with hits . It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single , 2 for a double , 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run . Only bases attained from hits count toward this total . Reaching base by other means ( such as a base on balls ) or advancing further after the hit ( such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit ) does not increase the player 's total bases . In box scores and other statistical summaries , total bases is often denoted by the abbreviation TB . The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player 's slugging average .",
  "/wiki/Single_(baseball)": "In baseball , a single is the most common type of base hit , accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball ( thus becoming a runner ) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out . As an exception , a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play ; this is one type of a fielder 's choice . Also , a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder 's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out ( as a fielder 's choice ) is not credited with a single . On a single hit to the outfield , any runners on second base or third base normally score , and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to third base . Depending on the location of the hit , a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner . Hitters who focus on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often called contact hitters . Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits well and having fast running speed to achieve singles are often called slap hitters . Ty Cobb , Pete Rose , Tony Gwynn , and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of contact hitters ; of these , Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters .",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A double is a type of hit ( the others being the single , triple and home run ) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",
  "/wiki/Lou_Gehrig": "Henry Louis Gehrig ( born Heinrich Ludwig Gehrig ; June 19 , 1903 - June 2 , 1941 ) was an American professional baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the New York Yankees ( 1923-1939 ) . Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability , which earned him his nickname The Iron Horse . He was an All-Star seven consecutive times , a Triple Crown winner once , an American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player twice , and a member of six World Series champion teams . He had a career .340 batting average , .632 slugging average , and a .447 on base average . He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in ( RBI ) . He still has the highest ratio of runs scored plus runs batted in per 100 plate appearances ( 35.08 ) and per 100 games ( 156.7 ) among Hall of Fame players . In 1939 , he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number ( 4 ) retired by a team . A native of New York City and a student at Columbia University , Gehrig signed with the Yankees in 1923 . He set several major-league records during his career , including the most career grand slams ( 23 ) ( since broken by Alex Rodriguez ) and most consecutive games played ( 2,130 ) , a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken Jr. , in 1995 . Gehrig 's consecutive game streak ended on May 2 , 1939 , when he voluntarily took himself out of the lineup , stunning both players and fans , after his performance on the field became hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , an incurable neuromuscular illness ; it is now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig 's disease . The disease forced him to retire at age 36 , and was the cause of his death two years later . The pathos of his farewell from baseball was capped off by his iconic 1939 Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth speech at Yankee Stadium .",
  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/500_home_run_club": "In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the 500 home run club is a group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers . On August 11 , 1929 , Babe Ruth became the first member of the club . Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs , a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974 . Aaron 's ultimate career total , 755 , remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season . Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club . Ted Williams ( .344 ) holds the highest batting average among the club members while Harmon Killebrew ( .256 ) holds the lowest . Of these 27 players , 14 were right-handed batters , 11 were left-handed , and 2 were switch hitters . The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are the only franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster : for the Giants , Mel Ott while the team was in New York , Willie Mays , Willie McCovey , and most recently Bonds , and , for the Red Sox , Jimmie Foxx , Williams , and more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz . Six 500 home run club members - Aaron , Mays , Eddie Murray , Rafael Palmeiro , Albert Pujols , and Alex Rodriguez - are also members of the 3,000 hit club . Gary Sheffield 's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets , the first time that a player 's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise . Rodriguez , at 32 years and 8 days , was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams , at 41 years and 291 days , was the oldest . The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz , who hit his 500th home run on September 12 , 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Run_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",
  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",
  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",
  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",
