The album features an increasingly heavy use of synthesized orchestration from Josef Zawinul , who had been becoming even more dominant within the band 's sound . Zawinul was by now frequently doubling the basslines on Quadra synthesizer , something which annoyed and alienated Pastorius , who also had reservations about Zawinul 's electronic big band sound ( and who was himself increasingly working on a side career with a mostly acoustic band ) . The vast majority of the album was composed by Zawinul , with the exception of one Wayne Shorter piece and one collectively composed item assembled from a group jam . The center piece of the album is the three part N.Y.C . The three movement suite starts with 41st Parallel , a bouncing groove showing off Erskine 's unique touch on the drums . The second movement , The Dance , is a more traditional swing feel , but with Zawinul 's synthesizer orchestration heavily laid on top .

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music . Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz . Born in Alton , Illinois and raised in East St. Louis , Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City , before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948 . Shortly after , he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz . In the early 1950s , Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight . It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s . During this period , he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans , such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain ( 1960 ) , and band recordings , such as Milestones ( 1958 ) and Kind of Blue ( 1959 ) . The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time , having sold over four million copies in the U.S. Davis made several line-up changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come ( 1961 ) , his 1961 Blackhawk concerts , and Seven Steps to Heaven ( 1963 ) , another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter , pianist Herbie Hancock , and drummer Tony Williams . After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964 , Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members , helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P ( 1965 ) and Miles Smiles ( 1967 ) , before transitioning into his electric period . During the 1970s , he experimented with rock , funk , African rhythms , emerging electronic music technology , and an ever-changing line-up of musicians , including keyboardist Joe Zawinul , drummer Al Foster , and guitarist John McLaughlin .",

  "/wiki/On_the_Corner_(album)": "On the Corner is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter , bandleader , and composer Miles Davis . It was recorded in June and July 1972 and released on October 11 of the same year by Columbia Records . The album continued Davis 's exploration of jazz fusion , and explicitly drew on the influences of composer Paul Buckmaster , funk and soul musicians Sly Stone and James Brown , the experimental music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , and the free jazz of Ornette Coleman . Recording sessions for the album featured a changing lineup of musicians including bassist Michael Henderson , guitarist John McLaughlin , and keyboardist Herbie Hancock , with Davis playing the electric organ more prominently than his trumpet . Various takes from the sessions were then spliced together using the tape editing techniques of producer Teo Macero . The album 's packaging did not credit any musicians , an attempt to make the instruments less discernible to critics . Its artwork features Corky McCoy 's cartoon designs of urban African-American characters . On the Corner was in part an effort by Davis to reach a younger African American audience who had left jazz for funk and rock and roll . Instead , thanks to Columbia 's lack of target marketing , it was one of Davis 's worst-selling albums and was scorned by jazz critics at the time of its release . It would be Davis 's last studio album of the 1970s conceived as a complete work ; subsequently , he recorded haphazardly and focused instead on live performance before temporarily retiring from music in 1975 . The critical standing of On the Corner has improved dramatically with the passage of time . Many outside the jazz community later called it an innovative musical statement and forerunner to subsequent funk , jazz , post-punk , electronica , and hip hop .",

The band 's debut album can be described as jazz-rock , though it is much closer to traditional jazz than the jazz-rock albums of the 1970s . The keyboard sounds on the album are typical for the mid-1980s . The drums played by Dave Weckl dominate the album 's sound , with the guitar duties split between Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios . The second album , Light Years ( 1987 ) is more funk-oriented than its predecessor . Saxophonist Eric Marienthal joins the band and Frank Gambale replaces Henderson and Rios ( who still plays on some tracks ) to form what is considered the band 's definitive lineup . The third album , Eye of the Beholder , relies on softer sounds . Here Corea relies on acoustic piano , with synthesizers largely in the background . Gambale also plays acoustic guitar on some tracks , lending a Flamenco-influenced sound to pieces like Eternal Child .
