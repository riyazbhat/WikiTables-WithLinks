  "/wiki/The_Art_of_Unix_Programming": "The Art of Unix Programming by Eric S. Raymond is a book about the history and culture of Unix programming from its earliest days in 1969 to 2003 when it was published , covering both genetic derivations such as BSD and conceptual ones such as Linux . The author utilizes a comparative approach to explaining Unix by contrasting it to other operating systems including desktop-oriented ones such as Microsoft Windows and the classic Mac OS to ones with research roots such as EROS and Plan 9 from Bell Labs . The book was published by Addison-Wesley , September 17 , 2003 , ISBN 0-13-142901-9 and is also available online , under a Creative Commons license with additional clauses .",
  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",
  "/wiki/Computer_programming": "Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result . Programming involves tasks such as : analysis , generating algorithms , profiling algorithms ' accuracy and resource consumption , and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language ( commonly referred to as coding ) . The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers , rather than machine code , which is directly executed by the central processing unit . The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task ( which can be as complex as an operating system ) on a computer , often for solving a given problem . The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects , including knowledge of the application domain , specialized algorithms , and formal logic . Tasks accompanying and related to programming include : testing , debugging , source code maintenance , implementation of build systems , and management of derived artifacts , such as the machine code of computer programs . These might be considered part of the programming process , but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming , implementation , or coding reserved for the actual writing of code . Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices . Reverse engineering is the opposite process . A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem , but it can also mean a security hacker in common language .",

  "/wiki/The_Future_of_Ideas": "The Future of Ideas : The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World ( 2001 ) is a book by Lawrence Lessig , at the time of writing a professor of law at Stanford Law School , who is well known as a critic of the extension of the copyright term in US . It is a continuation of his previous book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace , which is about how computer programs can restrict freedom of ideas in cyberspace . While copyright helps artists get rewarded for their work , Lessig warns that a copyright regime that is too strict and grants copyright for too long a period of time ( e.g . the current US legal climate ) can destroy innovation , as the future always builds on the past . Lessig also discusses recent movements by corporate interests to promote longer and tighter protection of intellectual property in three layers : the code layer , the content layer , and the physical layer . The code layer is that which is controlled by computer programs . One instance is Internet censorship in mainland China by sorting out geographical IP addresses . The content layer is notoriously illustrated by Napster , a peer-to-peer file sharing service . Lessig criticizes the reaction of music companies and Hollywood . The physical layer is the one that actually conveys information from one point to another , and can be either wired or wireless . He discusses particularly the regulation of the radio spectrum in the United States . In the end , he stresses the importance of existing works entering the public domain in a reasonably short period of time , as the Founding Fathers intended .",

  "/wiki/Internet": "The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing . The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication with computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s , commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life . Most traditional communication media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are reshaped , redefined , or even bypassed by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .",

  "/wiki/Wikipedia": "Wikipedia ( /\u02ccw\u026ak\u026a\u02c8pi\u02d0di\u0259/ ( listen ) wik-ih-PEE-dee-\u0259 or /\u02ccw\u026aki\u02c8pi\u02d0di\u0259/ ( listen ) wik-ee-PEE-dee-\u0259 ) is a multilingual online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration project by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system . It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web , and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa as of January 2020 . It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads , and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations . Wikipedia was launched on January 15 , 2001 , by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger . Sanger coined its name , as a portmanteau of wiki ( the Hawaiian word for quick ) and encyclopedia . Initially an English-language encyclopedia , versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed . With at least 6,017,601 articles , [ note 3 ] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias . Overall , Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month . In 2005 , Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia 's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica , although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues . The following year , Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world , and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales . Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias , for presenting a mixture of truth , half truth , and some falsehoods , and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics . Wikipedia has been criticized for gender bias , particularly on its English-language site , where the dominant majority of editors are male .",

  "/wiki/Remix_culture": "Remix culture , sometimes read-write culture , is a society that allows and encourages derivative works by combining or editing existing materials to produce a new creative work or product . A remix culture would be , by default , permissive of efforts to improve upon , change , integrate , or otherwise remix the work of copyright holders . While a common practice of artists of all domains throughout human history , the growth of exclusive copyright restrictions in the last several decades limits this practice more and more by the legal chilling effect . In reaction , Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig who considers remixing a desirable concept for human creativity has worked since the early 2000s on a transfer of the remixing concept into the digital age . Lessig founded the Creative Commons in 2001 which released Licenses as tools to enable remix culture again , as remixing is legally prevented by the default exclusive copyright regime applied currently on intellectual property . The remix culture for cultural works is related to and inspired by the earlier Free and open-source software for software movement , which encourages the reuse and remixing of software works .",
