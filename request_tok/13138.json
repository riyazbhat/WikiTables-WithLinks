The former Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe Railroad ( ATSF ) , now the Burlington Northern Santa Fe ( BNSF ) , passes through Lamy . This railroad , usually called just the Santa Fe , was originally planned to run from Atchison , Kansas , on the Missouri River , to Santa Fe , the capital city of New Mexico , and then points west . However , as the tracks progressed west into New Mexico , the civil engineers in charge realized that the hills surrounding Santa Fe made this impractical . Hence , they built the railway line though Lamy , instead . Later on , a spur line was built from Lamy to Santa Fe , bringing the railroad to Santa Fe at last . In 1896 the Fred Harvey Company built the luxurious El Ortiz Hotel here . Thus Lamy became an important railroad junction . In 1992 the spur line was taken over by the Santa Fe Southern Railway , which operated a popular excursion train , using vintage passenger railcars and modern freight cars , between Santa Fe and Lamy .",
