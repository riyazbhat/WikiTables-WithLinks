Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",

  "/wiki/Wild_mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",

  "/wiki/3D_film": "A three-dimensional stereoscopic film ( also known as three-dimensional film , 3D film or S3D film ) is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception , hence adding a third dimension . The most common approach to the production of 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography . In this approach , a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives ( or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production ) , and special projection hardware or eyewear is used to limit the visibility of each image to the viewer 's left or right eye only . 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases ; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods , especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D . 3D films have existed in some form since 1915 , but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film , and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business . Nonetheless , 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema , and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues . 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s , peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 , after which 3D films again decreased in popularity . Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking , most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his films 3X3D and Goodbye to Language .",
