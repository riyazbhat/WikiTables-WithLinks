  "/wiki/Addingham": "Addingham ( formerly Haddincham c. 972 , Odingehem 1086 ) is a village and civil parish in the English county of West Yorkshire . It is situated near the A65 , 6 miles ( 10 km ) south east of Skipton , 3 miles ( 5 km ) west of Ilkley , 19 miles ( 31 km ) north west of Bradford and around 20 miles ( 32 km ) north west of Leeds . Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , it is located in the valley of the River Wharfe and is only 1 mile ( 2 km ) from the Yorkshire Dales National Park . The name is thought to mean homestead associated with a man called Adda , although in the Domesday Book , the village was referred to as Ediham , which may have referred to Earl Edwin of Bolton Abbey . The 2001 census numbered Addingham 's population at 3,599 , increasing to 3,730 at the 2011 Census . The area around Addingham is thought to have been populated from at least Bronze Age times , indicated by the 'cup and ring ' carved stones that can be found on Addingham Moor . Its beginnings may date back to the late Mesolithic period , as evidenced by the scattered remains of early flint tools across Rombald 's Moor to the south . The earliest of the existing houses were built in the 17th century when the village was a farming community , but the real growth began in the late 18th century and early 19th century when the textile industry arrived and five working mills , plus other loomshops and weaving sheds , were established , and the village developed into a busy industrial community . The village grew up around three centres ; Church Street in the east ; The Green , about a mile away in the west ; and the Old School in between . This is thought [ by whom ? ] to be one of the reasons the village used to be known as Long Addingham . Since the decline of the textile industry during the 20th century , the village has now become largely a commuter and retirement community",
  "/wiki/West_Yorkshire": "West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England . It is an inland and , in relative terms , upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in the moors of the Pennines . West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 and has a population of 2.2 million . West Yorkshire consists of five metropolitan boroughs ( City of Bradford , Calderdale , Kirklees , City of Leeds and City of Wakefield ) and is bordered by the counties of Derbyshire to the south , Greater Manchester to the south-west , Lancashire to the north-west , North Yorkshire to the north and east , and South Yorkshire to the south and south-east . Remnants of strong coal , wool and iron ore industries remain in the county , having attracted people over the centuries , and this can be seen in the buildings and architecture . Major railways and two major motorways traverse the county , which also contains Leeds Bradford International Airport . West Yorkshire County Council was abolished in 1986 , so its five districts became effectively unitary authorities . However , the metropolitan county , which covers an area of 2,029 square kilometres ( 783 sq mi ) , continues to exist in law , and as a geographic frame of reference . Since 1 April 2014 West Yorkshire has been a combined authority area , with the local authorities pooling together some functions over transport and regeneration as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority . West Yorkshire includes the West Yorkshire Urban Area , which is the biggest and most built-up urban area within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire",
  "/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends": "Quakers , also called Friends , are a historically Christian group whose formal name is the Religious Society of Friends or Friends Church . Members of the various Quaker movements are all generally united by their belief in the ability of each human being to experientially access the light within , or that of God in every one . Some may profess the priesthood of all believers , a doctrine derived from the First Epistle of Peter . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity . There are also Nontheist Quakers whose spiritual practice is not reliant on the existence of God . To differing extents , the different movements that make up the Religious Society of Friends/Friends Church avoid creeds and hierarchical structures . In 2007 , there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide . In 2017 , there were 377,557 adult Quakers , with 49 % in Africa . Around 89 % of Quakers worldwide belong to the evangelical and programmed branches of Quakerism - these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible , coordinated by a pastor . Around 11 % of Friends practice waiting worship , or unprogrammed worship ( more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship ) , where the order of service is not planned in advance , is predominantly silent , and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present . Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings - Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry . The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England",
  "/wiki/Act_of_Toleration_1689": "The Toleration Act 1688 ( 1 Will & Mary c 18 ) , also referred to as the Act of Toleration , was an Act of the Parliament of England , which received the royal assent on 24 May 1689 . The Act allowed freedom of worship to nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation , i.e. , Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists , Congregationalists or English Presbyterians , but not to Roman Catholics . Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own schoolteachers , so long as they accepted certain oaths of allegiance . The Act intentionally did not apply to Roman Catholics , nontrinitarians , and atheists . It continued the existing social and political disabilities for dissenters , including their exclusion from holding political offices and also from the universities . Dissenters were required to register their meeting houses and were forbidden from meeting in private homes . Any preachers who dissented had to be licensed . Between 1772 and 1774 , Dr Edward Pickard gathered together dissenting ministers , to campaign for the terms of the Toleration Act for dissenting clergy to be modified . Under his leadership , Parliament twice considered bills to modify the law , but both were unsuccessful and it was not until Pickard and many others had ended their efforts that a new attempt was made in 1779 . The Act was amended in 1779 by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican churches , but some penalties on holding property remained . Penalties against Unitarians were finally removed in the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813",

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent",

Its tidal section , reaching up to Teddington Lock , includes most of its London stretch and has a rise and fall of 23 feet ( 7 m ) . Running through some of the driest parts of mainland Britain and heavily abstracted for drinking water , the Thames ' discharge is low considering its length and breadth : the Severn has a discharge almost twice as large on average despite having a smaller drainage basin . In Scotland , the Tay achieves more than double the Thames ' average discharge from a drainage basin that is 60 % smaller . Along its course are 45 navigation locks with accompanying weirs .

  "/wiki/Presbyterianism": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches",

It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world . As an international fellowship , the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous ; however , they are united by shared beliefs and history . The Assemblies originated from the Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914 . Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches , the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement . It was not until 1988 , however , that the world fellowship was formed . As a Pentecostal fellowship , the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues .

  "/wiki/Thatching": "Thatching is the craft of building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw , water reed , sedge ( Cladium mariscus ) , rushes , heather , or palm branches , layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof . Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed - trapping air - thatching also functions as insulation . It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both tropical and temperate climates . Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries , usually with low-cost local vegetation . By contrast , in some developed countries it is the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home , would like a more ecologically friendly roof , or who have purchased an originally thatched abode",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate .

  "/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)": "In Christianity , an elder is a person who is valued for wisdom and holds a position of responsibility and authority in a Christian group . In some Christian traditions ( e.g. , Eastern Orthodoxy , Roman Catholicism , Anglicanism , Methodism ) an elder is an ordained person who usually serves a local church or churches and who has been ordained to a ministry of word , sacrament and order , filling the preaching and pastoral offices . In other Christian traditions ( e.g. , Presbyterianism , Churches of Christ , Plymouth Brethren ) , an elder may be a lay person charged with serving as an administrator in a local , or be ordained to such an office , also serving in the preaching ( in this case referring to teaching done during church gatherings ) or pastoral roles . There is technically a distinction between the idea of ordained elders and lay elders , often the two concepts are conflated in everyday conversation ( for example , a lay elder in the Baptist tradition may still be referred to as being clergy , especially in America ) . Particularly in reference to age and experience , elders exist throughout world cultures , and the Christian sense of elder is partially related to this",

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation",
  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques",

  "/wiki/Lutheranism": "Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther , a 16th-century German reformer . Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation . The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings , beginning with the 95 Theses , divided Western Christianity . The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms : the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas , subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property , half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation . The divide centered primarily on two points : the proper source of authority in the church , often called the formal principle of the Reformation , and the doctrine of justification , often called the material principle of Lutheran theology . [ a ] Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone , the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith . This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church , defined at the Council of Trent , concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition . Unlike Calvinism , Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper .

Following the death of the Jacobite claimant to the British throne James Francis Edward Stuart on 1 January 1766 , the Pope recognised the legitimacy of the Hanoverian dynasty , which began a process of rapprochement between the Catholic Church and the United Kingdom . Over the next sixty-three years , various bills were introduced in Parliament to repeal restrictions against practise of the Catholic faith , but these bills encountered political opposition , especially during the Napoleonic Wars .

The council , through the Holy See , was formally opened under the pontificate of Pope John XXIII on 11 October 1962 and was closed under Pope Paul VI on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 1965 . Several changes resulted from the council , including the renewal of consecrated life with a revised charism , ecumenical efforts towards dialogue with other religions , and the universal call to holiness , which according to Pope Paul VI was the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of the teachings of the Council . According to Pope Benedict XVI , the most important and essential message of the council is the Paschal Mystery as the center of what it is to be Christian and therefore of the Christian life , the Christian year , the Christian seasons . Other changes which followed the council included the widespread use of vernacular languages in the Mass instead of Latin , the subtle disuse of ornate clerical regalia , the revision of Eucharistic ( liturgical ) prayers , the abbreviation of the liturgical calendar , the ability to celebrate the Mass versus populum ( with the officiant facing the congregation ) , as well as ad orientem ( facing the East and the Crucifix ) , and modern aesthetic changes encompassing contemporary Catholic liturgical music and artwork . Many of these changes remain divisive among the Catholic faithful . Of those who took part in the council 's opening session , four have become popes : Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini , who on succeeding John XXIII took the name Pope Paul VI ; Bishop Albino Luciani , the future Pope John Paul I ; Bishop Karol Wojty\u0142a , who became Pope John Paul II ; and Father Joseph Ratzinger , present as a theological consultant , who became Pope Benedict XVI . In the 1950s , theological and biblical studies in the Catholic Church had begun to sway away from the Neo-Scholasticism and biblical literalism which a reaction to Catholic modernism had enforced since the First Vatican Council . [ citation needed ] This shift could be seen in theologians such as Karl Rahner , Michael Herbert , and John Courtney Murray who looked to integrate modern human experience with church principles based on Jesus Christ , as well as others such as Yves Congar , Joseph Ratzinger and Henri de Lubac , who looked to an accurate understanding of scripture and the early Church Fathers as a source of renewal ( ressourcement ) . At the same time , the world 's bishops faced challenges driven by political , social , economic , and technological change . Some of these bishops sought new ways of addressing those challenges . The First Vatican Council had been held nearly a century before but had been cut short in 1870 when the Italian Army entered the city of Rome at the end of Italian unification",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages .

Firstly , it could mean the prayers and liturgy in the Christian church reserved for the dead as part of the search for atonement for sins committed during their life . It might include the mass and by extension , the endowment left for the purpose of the continuance of prayers and liturgy . It could be called a type of trust fund established during the pre-Reformation medieval era in England for the purpose of employing one or more priests to sing a stipulated number of services for the benefit of the soul of a specified deceased person , usually the donor who had established the chantry in his will . There could be a stipulated period of time immediately following her/his death . It was believed such masses might help atone for misdeeds and with mercy enable the soul to be granted eternal peace in the presence of God . Chantries were commonly established in England and were endowed with lands , rents from specified properties and other assets by the donor , usually in his will . The income from these assets maintained the chantry priest . Alternatively , a chantry chapel is a building on private land or a dedicated area or altar within a parish church or cathedral , set aside or built especially for the performance of the chantry duties by the priest . A chantry may occupy a single altar , for example in the side aisle of a church , rather than an enclosed chapel within a larger church , generally dedicated to the donor 's favourite saint . Many chantry altars became richly endowed , often with gold furnishings and valuable vestments .

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style .

Many notable Scots have been called sons ( or daughters ) of the manse , and the term is a recurring point of reference within Scottish media and culture . For example , former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was described as a son of the manse as he is the son of a Presbyterian minister .

The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine .

  "/wiki/Umberslade_Hall": "Umberslade Hall is a 17th-century mansion converted into residential apartments situated near Tanworth in Arden , Warwickshire . It is a Grade II* listed building . The Archer family were granted the manor of Umberslade by Henry II in the 12th century and retained possession for some 600 years . The old manor house was replaced between 1695 and 1700 when Smith of Warwick built the new mansion for Andrew Archer , Member of Parliament for Warwickshire . The estate passed to his son Andrew Archer , 2nd Baron Archer , after whose death in 1778 it was ultimately settled on his daughter Sarah , Countess of Plymouth . The estate was sold in 1826 and from 1850 was leased by George Frederic Muntz , Member of Parliament for Birmingham . After his death in 1857 his son George Frederick bought the estate and much enlarged and improved the Hall . During this time Muntz junior had a church built on the estate , Umberslade Baptist Church , which exists to this day separately to the Hall . In 1881 the household comprised thirty including thirteen resident servants . Frederick Ernest Muntz who succeeded to the estate in 1898 served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1902 and as Deputy Lieutenant . The estate , much reduced , remains in the ownership of the Muntz family . From the 1960s the Hall was leased out to commercial tenants , [ citation needed ] including from 1967 BSA Motorcycles - Triumph Motorcycles , to merge their various design and development departments at a central point , roughly equi-distant from their manufacturing bases at Meriden , Redditch and Small Heath",

  "/wiki/Manor_house": "A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor . The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system ; within its great hall were held the lord 's manorial courts , communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets . The term is today loosely applied to various country houses , frequently dating from the late medieval era , which formerly housed the gentry . They were sometimes fortified , but this was frequently intended more for show than for defence . Manor houses existed in most European countries where feudalism existed , where they were sometimes known as castles , palaces , and so on",
  "/wiki/Protestant_Reformation": "The Reformation ( alternatively named the Protestant Reformation or the European Reformation ) was a movement within Western Christianity in the 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church and papal authority in particular . Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517 , there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms . The edict condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas . The end of the Reformation era is disputed : it could be considered to end with the enactment of the confessions of faith which began the Age of Orthodoxy . [ definition needed ] Other suggested ending years relate to the Counter-Reformation , the Peace of Westphalia , or that it never ended since there are still Protestants today . [ citation needed ] Movements had been made towards a Reformation prior to Luther , so some Protestants in the tradition of the Radical Reformation prefer to credit the start of the Reformation to reformers such as Arnold of Brescia , Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , Jan Hus , Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd , and Girolamo Savonarola . [ a ] Due to the reform efforts of Hus and other Bohemian reformers , Utraquist Hussitism was acknowledged by the Council of Basel and was officially tolerated in the Crown of Bohemia , although other movements were still subject to persecution , including the Lollards in England and the Waldensians in France and Italian regions . [ citation needed ] Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences , insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible . The Reformation developed further to include a distinction between Law and Gospel , a complete reliance on Scripture as the only source of proper doctrine ( sola scriptura ) and the belief that faith in Jesus is the only way to receive God 's pardon for sin ( sola fide ) rather than good works . Although this is generally considered a Protestant belief , a similar formulation was taught by Molinist and Jansenist Catholics . The priesthood of all believers downplayed the need for saints or priests to serve as mediators , and mandatory clerical celibacy was ended . Simul justus et peccator implied that although people could improve , no one could become good enough to earn forgiveness from God",

  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced",

In English it is also known as the Modern Style ( not to be confused with Modernism and Modern architecture ) . The style was most popular between 1890 and 1910 . It was a reaction against the academic art , eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration . It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers . Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement , often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines , and the use of modern materials , particularly iron , glass , ceramics and later concrete , to create unusual forms and larger open spaces . One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts ( especially painting and sculpture ) and applied arts . It was most widely used in interior design , graphic arts , furniture , glass art , textiles , ceramics , jewelry and metal work . The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians , such as French architect Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc ( 1814-1879 ) and British art critic John Ruskin ( 1819-1900 ) . In Britain , it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement . German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) that would unify the architecture , furnishings , and art in the interior in a common style , to uplift and inspire the residents . The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s , in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar , Henry van de Velde , and especially Victor Horta , whose H\u00f4tel Tassel was completed in 1893",

It had an estimated population of 139,720 at the 2011 Census , making it the most populous town in Lancashire . Throughout the Medieval and Early Modern period , Blackpool was a coastal hamlet in Lancashire 's Hundred of Amounderness , and remained such until the mid-18th century when it became fashionable in England to travel to the coast in the summer to improve well-being . In 1781 , visitors attracted to Blackpool 's 7-mile ( 11 km ) sandy beach were able to use a new private road , built by Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton . Stagecoaches began running to Blackpool from Manchester in the same year , and from Halifax in 1782 . In the early 19th century , Henry Banks and his son-in-law John Cocker erected new buildings in Blackpool such that its population grew from less than 500 in 1801 to over 2,500 in 1851 . St John 's Church in Blackpool was consecrated in 1821 . Blackpool rose to prominence as a major centre of tourism in England when a railway was built in the 1840s connecting it to the industrialised regions of Northern England . The railway made it much easier and cheaper for visitors to reach Blackpool , triggering an influx of settlers , such that in 1876 Blackpool was incorporated as a borough , governed by its own town council and aldermen . In 1881 , Blackpool was a booming resort with a population of 14,000 and a promenade complete with piers , fortune-tellers , public houses , trams , donkey rides , fish-and-chip shops and theatres . By 1901 the population of Blackpool was 47,000 , by which time its place was cemented as the archetypal British seaside resort",
