  "/wiki/Ice_Hockey": "Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice , usually in a rink , in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent 's net to score goals . The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical , with teams usually fielding six players at a time : one goaltender , and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score goals against the opposing team . Ice hockey is most popular in Canada , central and eastern Europe , the Nordic countries , Russia , and the United States . Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada . In addition , ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus , Croatia , the Czech Republic , Finland , Latvia , Russia , Slovakia , Sweden , and Switzerland . North America 's National Hockey League ( NHL ) is the highest level for men 's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world . The Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe . The International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey , with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking . Worldwide , there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries . In Canada , the United States , Nordic countries , and some other European countries the sport is known simply as hockey ; the name ice hockey is used in places where hockey more often refers to the more popular field hockey , such as countries in South America , Asia , Africa , Australasia , and some European countries including the United Kingdom , Ireland and the Netherlands . Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed , such as shinny and ice polo",

  "/wiki/Figure_Skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions",

As with horse racing , greyhound races often allow the public to bet on the outcome . In many countries greyhound racing is purely amateur and solely for enjoyment . In other countries , particularly Australia , Ireland , Macau , Mexico , Spain , the United Kingdom and the United States , greyhound racing is part of the gambling industry and similar to horse racing . Animal rights and animal welfare groups are critical of the welfare of greyhounds in the commercial racing industry . A greyhound adoption movement spearheaded by kennel owners has arisen to assist retired racing dogs in finding homes as pets , with an estimated adoption rate of over 95 % in the US",

  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century .

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports .
