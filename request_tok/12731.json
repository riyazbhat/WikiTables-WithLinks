It is bordered by Egypt to the north , Libya to the northwest , Chad to the west , the Central African Republic to the southwest , South Sudan to the south , Ethiopia to the southeast , Eritrea to the east , and the Red Sea to the northeast . Sudan has a population of 43 million ( 2018 estimate ) and occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres ( 728,215 square miles ) , making it Africa 's third-largest country and also the third-largest in the Arab world . Before South Sudan 's secession from Sudan on 9 July 2011 , the united Sudan was the largest country in Africa and the Arab world by area . Sudan 's predominant religion is Islam , and its official languages are Arabic and English . The capital is Khartoum , located at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile . Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north . This period saw extensive Islamisation and Arabisation .",

The Nile , which is about 6,650 km ( 4,130 mi ) [ n 1 ] long , is an international river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries : Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya , Ethiopia , Eritrea , South Sudan , Republic of the Sudan , and Egypt . In particular , the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan . The Nile has two major tributaries - the White Nile and the Blue Nile . The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself . The Blue Nile , however , is the source of most of the water and silt . The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa , with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi . It flows north through Tanzania , Lake Victoria , Uganda and South Sudan . The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast . The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum . The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt , then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea . Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times .",
  "/wiki/Sudd": "The Sudd ( as-Sudd or al-Sudd ) is a vast swamp in South Sudan , formed by the White Nile 's Ba\u1e25r al-Jabal section . The Arabic word sudd is derived from sadd ( \u0633\u062f ) , meaning barrier or obstruction . The term the sudd has come to refer to any large solid floating vegetation island or mat . The area which the swamp covers is one of the world 's largest wetlands and the largest freshwater wetland in the Nile basin . For many years the swamp , and especially its thicket of vegetation , proved an impenetrable barrier to navigation along the Nile . The ancient Egyptians failed to penetrate the Sudd and reach the areas south of it . In AD 61 , a party of Roman soldiers sent by the Emperor Nero proceeded up the White Nile but were not able to get beyond the Sudd , which marked the limit of Roman penetration into equatorial Africa . For the same reasons in later times the search for the source of the Nile was particularly difficult ; it eventually involved overland expeditions from the central African coast , so as to avoid having to travel through the Sudd . In 2019 a team of climate scientists led by the UK 's Edinburgh University published a study in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , that suggested increased water flows into the Sudd may be partly causing up to a third of the global rise in atmospheric methane levels over the previous decade .",

Having a semi-arid climate , it stretches across the south-central latitudes of Northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea . The name is derived from the Arabic term for coast , shore : this is explained as being used in a figurative sense ( in reference to the southern edge of the vast Sahara ) . However , such figurative use is unattested in Classical Arabic , and it has been suggested that the word may originally have been derived from Arabic word sahl \u0633\u0647\u0644 plain instead .

  "/wiki/Ecoregion": "An ecoregion ( ecological region ) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion , which in turn is smaller than an ecozone . Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water , and contain characteristic , geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species . The biodiversity of flora , fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions . In theory , biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant , within an acceptable range of variation ( largely undefined at this point ) . Three caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches . Firstly , no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa . Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible . Secondly , ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges ; rather , ecotones and mosaic habitats bound them . Thirdly , most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned biome . Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers , including physical ( plate tectonics , topographic highs ) , climatic ( latitudinal variation , seasonal range ) and ocean chemical related ( salinity , oxygen levels ) .",

  "/wiki/Drainage_basin": "A drainage basin is any area of land where precipitation collects and drains off into a common outlet , such as into a river , bay , or other body of water . The drainage basin includes all the surface water from rain runoff , snowmelt , and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet , as well as the groundwater underneath the earth 's surface . Drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a hierarchical pattern , with smaller sub-drainage basins , which in turn drain into another common outlet . Other terms for drainage basin are catchment area , catchment basin , drainage area , river basin , water basin , and impluvium . In North America , the term watershed is commonly used to mean a drainage basin , though in other English-speaking countries , it is used only in its original sense , that of a drainage divide . In a closed drainage basin , or endorheic basin , the water converges to a single point inside the basin , known as a sink , which may be a permanent lake , a dry lake , or a point where surface water is lost underground . The drainage basin acts as a funnel by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point . Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter , the drainage divide , making up a succession of higher geographical features ( such as a ridge , hill or mountains ) forming a barrier . Drainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units , which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system . Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets , outlets , or sinks . In a strict sense , all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins .",

Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camar\u00f5es ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century , and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms . Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun . After World War I , the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates .",

  "/wiki/Dry_season": "The dry season is a yearly period of low rainfall , especially in the tropics . The weather in the tropics is dominated by the tropical rain belt , which moves from the northern to the southern tropics and back over the course of the year . The tropical rain belt lies in the southern hemisphere roughly from October to March ; during that time the northern tropics have a dry season with sparser precipitation , and days are typically sunny throughout . From April to September , the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere , and the southern tropics have their dry season . Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification , for tropical climates , a dry season month is defined as a month when average precipitation is below 60 millimetres ( 2.4 in ) . During the dry season , humidity is very low , causing some watering holes and rivers to dry up . This lack of water ( and hence of food ) may force many grazing animals to migrate to more fertile spots . Examples of such animals are zebras , elephants , and wildebeest . Because of the lack of water in the plants , bushfires are common . Data shows that in Africa the start of the dry season coincides with a rise in the cases of measles - which researchers believe might be attributed to the higher concentration of people in the dry season , as agricultural operations are all but impossible without irrigation . During this time , some farmers move into cities , creating hubs of higher population density , and allowing the disease to spread more easily . The rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the Tropic of Cancer and as far south as the Tropic of Capricorn .",

The plateau is characterised by hills and valleys in the southwest and a more gentle peneplain in the southwest . Isolated massifs occur , especially in the southwest . Metamorphic rocks make up the plain 's basement . The soils are ferrallitic and lateritic , with colouration ranging from red or brown in the interior to yellow on the coast . The soils are subjected to silica leeching , so they are not productive without fertiliser . The plateau experiences four major seasons , two rainy , and two dry . Rainfall is high , especially along the coast . The average temperature changes little from 25\u00b0C . Rivers in the region drain into the Atlantic Ocean and the Congo River basin .",
  "/wiki/Wet_season": "The wet season ( sometimes called the rainy season ) is the time of year when most of a region 's average annual rainfall occurs . Generally the season lasts at least a month . The term 'green season ' is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities . Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics . Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification , for tropical climates , a wet season month is defined as a month where average precipitation is 60 millimetres ( 2.4 in ) or more . In contrast to areas with savanna climates and monsoon regimes , Mediterranean climates have wet winters and dry summers . Dry and rainy months are characteristic of tropical seasonal forests : in contrast to tropical rainforests , which do not have dry or wet seasons , since their rainfall is equally distributed throughout the year . Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season , when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough moves to higher latitudes in the middle of the warm season . When the wet season occurs during a warm season , or summer , precipitation falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening . In the wet season , air quality improves , fresh water quality improves , and vegetation grows substantially , leading to crop yields late in the season . Rivers overflow their banks , and some animals retreat to higher ground . Soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases .",

  "/wiki/Volcanic_crater_lake": "A volcanic crater lake is a lake in a crater that was formed from explosive activity or collapse during a volcanic eruption . Lakes in calderas fill large craters formed by the collapse of a volcano during an eruption . Lakes in maars fill medium-sized craters where an eruption deposited debris around a vent . Crater lakes form as the created depression , within the crater rim , is filled by water . The water may come from precipitation , groundwater circulation ( often hydrothermal fluids in the case of volcanic craters ) or melted ice . Its level rises until an equilibrium is reached between the rates of incoming and outgoing water . Sources of water loss singly or together may include evaporation , subsurface seepage , and , in places , surface leakage or overflow when the lake level reaches the lowest point on its rim . At such a saddle location , the upper portion of the lake is contained only by its adjacent natural volcanic dam ; continued leakage through or surface outflow across the dam can erode its included material , thus lowering lake level until a new equilibrium of water flow , erosion , and rock resistance is established . If the volcanic dam portion erodes rapidly or fails catastrophically , the occurrence produces a breakout or outburst flood . With changes in environmental conditions over time , the occurrence of such floods is common to all natural dam types . A well-known crater lake , which bears the same name as the geological feature , is Crater Lake in Oregon . It is located in the caldera of Mount Mazama .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Nyos": "Lake Nyos ( /\u02c8nio\u028as/ NEE-ohs ) is a crater lake in the Northwest Region of Cameroon , located about 315 km ( 196 mi ) northwest of Yaound\u00e9 , the capital . Nyos is a deep lake high on the flank of an inactive volcano in the Oku volcanic plain along the Cameroon line of volcanic activity . A volcanic dam impounds the lake waters . A pocket of magma lies beneath the lake and leaks carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the water , changing it into carbonic acid . Nyos is one of only three known exploding lakes to be saturated with carbon dioxide in this way , the others being Lake Monoun , also in Cameroon , and Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda . In 1986 , possibly as the result of a landslide , Lake Nyos suddenly emitted a large cloud of CO2 , which suffocated 1,746 people and 3,500 livestock in nearby towns and villages . Though not completely unprecedented , it was the first known large-scale asphyxiation caused by a natural event . To prevent a recurrence , a degassing tube that siphons water from the bottom layers to the top , allowing the carbon dioxide to leak in safe quantities , was installed in 2001 . Two additional tubes were installed in 2011 . Today , the lake also poses a threat because its natural wall is weakening . A geological tremor could cause this natural lev\u00e9e to give way , allowing water to rush into downstream villages all the way into Nigeria and allowing large amounts of carbon dioxide to escape .",

The constitution defines Nigeria as a democratic secular state. , Nigeria has been home to a number of ancient and indigenous kingdoms and states over the millennia . The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and took its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Fredrick Lugard . The British set up administrative and legal structures while practicing indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms , Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 . It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . It thereafter alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with the 2011 presidential election considered the first to be reasonably free and fair .

  "/wiki/Savannas": "A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland-grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close . The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses . Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density . It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced , scattered trees . However , in many savannas , tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests . The South American savanna types cerrado sensu stricto and cerrado dense typically have densities of trees similar to or higher than that found in South American tropical forests , with savanna ranging from 800-3300 trees per hectare ( trees/ha ) and adjacent forests with 800-2000 trees/ha . Similarly Guinean savanna has 129 trees/ha , compared to 103 for riparian forest , while Eastern Australian sclerophyll forests have average tree densities of approximately 100 per hectare , comparable to savannas in the same region . Savannas are also characterised by seasonal water availability , with the majority of rainfall confined to one season ; they are associated with several types of biomes , and are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland . Savanna covers approximately 20 % of the Earth 's land area .",

The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was 137,800 square kilometres ( 53,200 sq mi ) , spanning 118 countries and territories . Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees , also called halophytes , and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions . They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action . They are adapted to the low oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud . The word is used in at least three senses : ( 1 ) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or mangal , [ page needed ] for which the terms mangrove forest biome , and mangrove swamp are also used , ( 2 ) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in a mangrove swamp , and ( 3 ) narrowly to refer just to true mangrove trees of the genus Rhizophora of the family Rhizophoraceae . [ citation needed ] The mangrove biome , or mangal , is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments , where fine sediments ( often with high organic content ) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action . The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water , through pure seawater ( 3 to 4 % ) , to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater ( up to 9 % ) .

  "/wiki/Desert": "A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and , consequently , living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life . The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation . About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid . This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or cold deserts . Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls , by the temperature that prevails , by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location . Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces . Although rain seldom occurs in deserts , there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods . Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind . This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms . Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface . Rocks are smoothed down , and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits . The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes .",

The Sassandra flows south-southeast to empty into the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean . The Buyo Dam was constructed across the middle stretch of the river in 1980 , just below the confluence with the Nzo River , to create the reservoir called Lake Buyo . The Davo River joins the Sassandra just before it meets the sea . The port town of Sassandra lies on the seacoast where the river meets the sea . The Sassandra and its tributaries flow through terrestrial ecoregions . The northern , or upper , part of the watershed lies in the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion . Further south , it forms the boundary between two tropical moist forest ecoregions , the Western Guinean lowland forests and the Eastern Guinean forests .",

  "/wiki/Plain": "In geography , a plain is a flat , sweeping landmass that generally does not change much in elevation . Plains occur as lowlands along valleys or on the doorsteps of mountains , as coastal plains , and as plateaus or uplands . In a valley , a plain is enclosed on two sides , but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills , by mountains , or by cliffs . Where a geological region contains more than one plain , they may be connected by a pass ( sometimes termed a gap ) . Coastal plains would mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus . Plains are one of the major landforms on earth , where they are present on all continents , and would cover more than one-third of the world 's land area . Plains may have been formed from flowing lava , deposited by water , ice , wind , or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains . Plains would generally be under the grassland ( temperate or subtropical ) , steppe ( semi-arid ) , savannah ( tropical ) or tundra ( polar ) biomes . In a few instances , deserts and rainforests can also be plains . Plains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile , and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production ; or because they support grasslands which provide good grazing for livestock .",
  "/wiki/Climate": "Climate is the long-term average of weather , typically averaged over a period of 30 years . Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature , humidity , atmospheric pressure , wind , and precipitation . In a broader sense , climate is the state of the components of the climate system , which includes the ocean and ice on Earth . The climate of a location is affected by its latitude , terrain , and altitude , as well as nearby water bodies and their currents . More generally , the climate of a region is the general state of the climate system at that location at the current time . Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables , most commonly temperature and precipitation . The most commonly used classification scheme was the K\u00f6ppen climate classification . The Thornthwaite system , in use since 1948 , incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it . The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region . Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates . Since very few direct observations of climate are available before the 19th century , paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores , and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral . Climate models are mathematical models of past , present and future climates .",
