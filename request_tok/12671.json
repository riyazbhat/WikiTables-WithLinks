In February 2009 , the Patriots used their franchise tag on Cassel , extending him a one-year contract worth over $ 14 million , the largest one-year contract for an offensive player in NFL history . Later that offseason , the Patriots made a trade which sent Cassel and linebacker Mike Vrabel to the Kansas City Chiefs , who signed Cassel to a 6-year , $ 62.7 million contract in July 2009 . In 2010 , Cassel led the Chiefs to their first AFC West divisional championship in seven years and earned a Pro Bowl selection in the process .

  "/wiki/Arena_Football_League": "The Arena Football League ( AFL ) was a professional indoor American football league in the United States . It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America , after the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The AFL played a proprietary code known as arena football , a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field ( about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field ) , with rules encouraging offensive performance , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster , a former executive of the United States Football League ( USFL ) and the NFL . From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 . The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008 ; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season , though the af2 did play . Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues , and the AFL returned in 2010 . The league 's average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500 . The league historically had a nationwide footprint , and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America , offering higher payment , more widespread media exposure , and a longer history than competing leagues . From a high of 19 teams in 2007 , the league contracted to a low of four teams in 2018 , all in the northeastern United States . There were six teams playing in 2019 , the league 's final season .
