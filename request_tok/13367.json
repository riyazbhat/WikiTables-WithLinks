  "/wiki/Too_Close_for_Comfort_(film)": "Too Close for Comfort is a Canadian docudrama short film , directed by Peg Campbell and released in 1990 . Created as an educational film about HIV/AIDS , the film explores the effects on a group of high school students when one of them is involuntarily outed as HIV-positive . The film stars Stephen Fanning as Nick , a high school basketball player who is fired from his after-school job at a video store when his boss is informed of his HIV status . As the information spreads , some of Nick 's friends immediately reject him because they incorrectly assume that he is gay ; however , some of his other friends rally around him and start to work on an educational video about HIV and homophobia , inserting the film 's educational component as they interview real people living with HIV about the disease . The film also simultaneously follows the progression of David ( Peter Stebbings ) from being the person who first tipped off their friends about what happened at the video store , through joining the filmmaking project , to revealing that he has himself been struggling with internalized homophobia around his own sexuality . The film premiered at the Pacific Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que on December 1 , 1990 . It was subsequently distributed for use in schools , along with a study guide on HIV and anti-homophobia education .

The film won the TVOntario Prize for Best Youth Documentary at the 1992 Banff Television Festival .",
