  "/wiki/Dodge": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC ( formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC ) , based in Auburn Hills , Michigan . Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars , though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler 's mid-priced brand above Plymouth . Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s , Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the Dodge Brothers brand in 1914 , predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation . The factory was located in Hamtramck , Michigan , and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980 . Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920 , and the company was sold by their families to Dillon , Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928 . Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s , though it made compact cars ( such as the 1963-76 Dart ) and midsize cars ( such as the B-Body Coronet and Charger from 1966-78 ) . The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year . The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler 's business in the 1980s ; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan . The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009 , including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007 , its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management , its 2009 bailout by the United States government , and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat . In 2011 , Dodge and its model sub-brands , Dodge Ram , and Dodge Viper were separated . Dodge said that the Viper would be an SRT product and Ram will be a standalone marque . In 2014 , SRT was merged back into Dodge .",
