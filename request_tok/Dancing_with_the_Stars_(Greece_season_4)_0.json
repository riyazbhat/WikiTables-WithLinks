A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist ( in jazz and popular music ) . Singers perform music ( arias , recitatives , songs , etc . ) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments . Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians , such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists . Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument ( as in art song or some jazz styles ) up to a symphony orchestra or big band . Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera , Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel , traditional music styles , world music , jazz , blues , ghazal and popular music styles such as pop , rock , electronic dance music and filmi ( Indian film songs ) . Singing can be formal or informal , arranged or improvised . It may be done as a form of religious devotion , as a hobby , as a source of pleasure , comfort or ritual , as part of music education or as a profession . Excellence in singing requires time , dedication , instruction and regular practice . If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong . Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre , such as classical or rock , although there are singers with crossover success ( singing in more than one genre )",

The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD .

The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games",

This is the essence of a designer 's role ; however , there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach , and product quality ; for example , budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends , but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used . Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing . They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn , and they work within a wide range of materials , colors , patterns and styles .
