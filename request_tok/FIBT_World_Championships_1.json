The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states",

In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

He twice rode the Grand National as gentleman rider and formed the first Spanish bobsleigh team with his cousins , finishing 4th in the 1956 Winter Olympics , shaving the bronze medal by 0.14 seconds . In 1953 , he was introduced into the Scuderia Ferrari team , competing at the Carrera Panamericana , 1000 km Buenos Aires and several Grand Prix , including a win and second place at the 1956 Tour de France Automobile and 1956 British Grand Prix respectively . In May 1957 , Portago 's renowned Ferrari 335 S crashed while taking a curve at 150m/h at the Mille Miglia , killing both drivers and 9 spectators . The young age of the Marquess who was 28 at the time of his death combined with his status as a sex symbol caused a shock amongst many , having several tributes and landmarks named after him , most notably the Portago curve at Jarama racetrack . The Marquess of Portago was seen by many as a true playboy of his time ; a tall , handsome and wealthy Spanish aristocrat who captured everybody 's imagination . Gregor Grant famously said of him : a man like Portago appears only once in a generation , and it would probably be more accurate to say only once in a lifetime . The fellow does everything fabulously well",
