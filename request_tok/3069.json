  "/wiki/Ambassadors_from_the_United_States": "Ambassadors of the United States are persons nominated as ambassadors by the President to serve as United States diplomats to individual nations of the world , to international organizations , and as ambassadors-at-large . Their appointment needs to be confirmed by the United States Senate . An ambassador can be appointed during a recess , but he or she can only serve as ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress unless subsequently confirmed . Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President , meaning they can be dismissed at any time . Appointments change regularly for various reasons , such as reassignment or retirement . An ambassador may be a career Foreign Service Officer ( career diplomat - CD ) or a political appointee ( PA ) . In most cases , career foreign service officers serve a tour of approximately three years per ambassadorship whereas political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president . As embassies fall under the State Department 's jurisdiction , ambassadors answer directly to the Secretary of State . The United States Department of State provides lists of ambassadors which are updated periodically . ( A recent list was issued on December 4 , 2018 . A further 24 nominees were confirmed on January 2 , 2019 , and a number of ambassadorships remain vacant . ) A listing by country of past chiefs of mission is maintained by the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State .",

It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 . On 12 December 2017 , the Portuguese Navy commemorated the 700th anniversary of its official creation by King Denis of Portugal . Tracing its origins back to the 12th century , it is the oldest continuously serving navy in the world .

It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/War_crime": "A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the laws of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility . Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners , torturing , destroying civilian property , taking hostages , performing a perfidy , raping , using child soldiers , pillaging , declaring that no quarter will be given , and seriously violating the principles of distinction , proportionality , and military necessity . The concept of war crimes emerged at the turn of the twentieth century when the body of customary international law applicable to warfare between sovereign states was codified . Such codification occurred at the national level , such as with the publication of the Lieber Code in the United States , and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 . Moreover , trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law . Following the end of World War II , major developments in the law occurred . Numerous trials of Axis war criminals established the Nuremberg principles , such as notion that war crimes constituted crimes defined by international law . Additionally , the Geneva Conventions in 1949 defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over such crimes . In the late 20th century and early 21st century , following the creation of several international courts , additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states , such as civil wars , were defined .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .
