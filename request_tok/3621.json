It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic . This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists ; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic , but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 , the purest Arabic ) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) . Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet . The Balkan languages , including Greek and Bulgarian , have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with Ottoman Turkish .",

From the Roman era , the museum also contains a rich collection of marble statues representing the deities and the Roman emperors found on different sites including those of Carthage and Thuburbo Majus . The museum also houses pieces discovered during the excavations of Libyco-Punic sites including Carthage , although the National Museum of Carthage has is the primary museum of the Carthage archaeological site . The essential pieces of this department are grimacing masks , terracotta statues and stelae of major interest for Semitic epigraphy , and the stele of the priest and the child .

  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",

  "/wiki/Ethography": "Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour , usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions , and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait . Behaviourism as a term also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour , usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or to trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context , without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity . Throughout history , different naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour . Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin ( 1809-1882 ) and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century , [ citation needed ] including Charles O. Whitman , Oskar Heinroth ( 1871-1945 ) , and Wallace Craig . The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen ( 1907-1988 ) and of Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch ( 1886-1982 ) , the three recipients of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Ethology combines laboratory and field science , with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy , ecology , and evolutionary biology . Ethologists typically show interest in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group , and often study one type of behaviour , such as aggression , in a number of unrelated species . Ethology is a rapidly growing field . Since the dawn of the 21st century researchers have re-examined and reached new conclusions in many aspects of animal communication , emotions , culture , learning and sexuality that the scientific community long thought it understood . New fields , such as neuroethology , have developed . Understanding ethology or animal behaviour can be important in animal training . Considering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables trainers to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task .",
  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",
