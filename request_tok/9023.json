  "/wiki/Video_game_developer": "A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development - the process and related disciplines of creating video games . A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines , such as programming , design , art , testing , etc . Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support . Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games . A developer may specialize in a certain video game console ( such as Nintendo 's Nintendo Switch , Microsoft 's Xbox One , Sony 's PlayStation 4 ) , or may develop for a number of systems ( including personal computers and mobile devices ) . [ citation needed ] Video game developers specialize in certain types of games ( such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters ) . Some focus on porting games from one system to another , or translating games from one language to another . Less commonly , some do software development work in addition to games . Most video game publishers maintain development studios ( such as Electronic Arts 's EA Canada , Square Enix 's studios , Activision 's Radical Entertainment , Nintendo EAD and Sony 's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog ) . However , since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as publishers rather than developers . Developers may be private as well ( such as how Bungie was , the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to Microsoft 's Xbox ) .",
  "/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle": "A software release life cycle is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer software . Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release , and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix software bugs still present in the software . Computer users are most likely to be familiar with the release cycle beta as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users ' expectations of their reliability .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

Panasonic produced the first models in 1993 , and further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by GoldStar ( now LG Electronics ) and in 1995 by Sanyo . Despite a highly promoted launch ( including being named Time magazine 's 1993 Product of the Year ) and a host of cutting-edge technologies , the 3DO 's high price and an oversaturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to veteran competitors Sega and Nintendo . As a result , it was discontinued in late 1996 .",

  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30 % and 40 % share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

It started as a proprietary PC variant intended for multimedia applications and PC games , but later became more compatible with regular PCs . In 1993 , the FM Towns Marty was released , a game console compatible with existing FM Towns games . The FM part of the name means Fujitsu Micro like their earlier products , while the Towns part is derived from the code name the system was assigned while in development , Townes . This refers to Charles Townes , one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics , following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to code name PC products after Nobel Prize winners . The e in Townes was dropped when the system went into production to make it clearer that the term was to be pronounced like the word towns rather than the potential tow-nes .",

  "/wiki/MS_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 . The PlayStation 2 , which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation 's DualShock controller and games , was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000 . The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier . Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 - over eleven years after it had been released , and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3 .

On January 30 , 2007 , it was released worldwide and was made available for purchase and download from the Windows Marketplace ; it is the first release of Windows to be made available through a digital distribution platform . The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor , Windows XP , the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems . New features of Windows Vista include an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero , a new search component called Windows Search , redesigned networking , audio , print and display sub-systems , and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker . Vista aimed to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network , using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices . Windows Vista included version 3.0 of the .NET Framework , allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs . Microsoft 's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system . One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors was their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware , viruses and buffer overflows . In light of this , Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide Trustworthy Computing initiative , which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company . Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista , thus delaying its completion .

  "/wiki/GPL": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products . Processors that have a RISC architecture typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing ( CISC ) architecture ( such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers ) , which improves cost , power consumption , and heat dissipation . These characteristics are desirable for light , portable , battery-powered devices\u200d - \u200cincluding smartphones , laptops and tablet computers , and other embedded systems . For supercomputers , which consume large amounts of electricity , ARM could also be a power-efficient solution . Arm Holdings periodically releases updates to the architecture . Architecture versions ARMv3 to ARMv7 support 32-bit address space ( pre-ARMv3 chips , made before Arm Holdings was formed , as used in the Acorn Archimedes , had 26-bit address space ) and 32-bit arithmetic ; most architectures have 32-bit fixed-length instructions . The Thumb version supports a variable-length instruction set that provides both 32- and 16-bit instructions for improved code density . Some older cores can also provide hardware execution of Java bytecodes ; and newer ones have one instruction for JavaScript . Released in 2011 , the ARMv8-A architecture added support for a 64-bit address space and 64-bit arithmetic with its new 32-bit fixed-length instruction set .

In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland .

The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 .

However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units ."
