The city population was 45,989 at the 2010 census , with an estimated population of 45,951 in 2018 . It is the principal city of the Hattiesburg , Mississippi , Metropolitan Statistical Area , which encompasses Forrest , Lamar and Perry counties . Development of the interior of Mississippi by European Americans took place primarily after the American Civil War . Before that time , only properties along the major rivers were developed as plantations . Founded in 1882 by civil engineer William H. Hardy , Hattiesburg was named in honor of Hardy 's wife Hattie . The town was incorporated two years later with a population of 400 . Hattiesburg 's population first expanded as a center of the lumber and railroad industries , from which was derived the nickname The Hub City . It now attracts newcomers because of the diversity of its economy , strong neighborhoods , and the central location in South Mississippi . Hattiesburg is home to The University of Southern Mississippi ( founded as Mississippi Normal College , for the training of teachers ) and William Carey University ( formerly William Carey College ) .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan",
  "/wiki/Magazine_(artillery)": "Magazine is the name for an item or place within which ammunition or other explosive material is stored . It is taken originally from the Arabic word makh\u0101zin ( \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0632\u0646 ) , meaning storehouses , via Italian and Middle French . The term is also used for a place where large quantities of ammunition are stored for later distribution , or an ammunition dump . This usage is less common",
  "/wiki/Prehistory": "Human prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c. 3.3 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems . The earliest writing systems appeared c. 5,300 years ago , but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted , and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present . The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places , and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently . Sumer in Mesopotamia , the Indus valley civilization , and ancient Egypt were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records ; this took place already during the early Bronze Age . Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow . Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the Iron Age . The three-age system of division of prehistory into the Stone Age , followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age , remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa , but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with Eurasian cultures , such as the Americas , Oceania , Australasia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa . These areas also , with some exceptions in Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas , did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians , and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods ; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia . The period when a culture is written about by others , but has not developed its own writing is often known as the protohistory of the culture . By definition , there are no written records from human prehistory , so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial . Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century . This article is concerned with human prehistory , the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history",

  "/wiki/Shingle_style_architecture": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses",

It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces",
