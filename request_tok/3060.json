Of mixed-race European-American , Native American , and Arab-American descent , she identified with her mother 's people , the Laguna Pueblo and childhood years . She drew from its oral traditions for her fiction poetry and also wrote numerous essays on its themes . She edited four collections of Native American traditional stories and contemporary works and wrote two biographies of Native American women . In addition to her literary work , in 1986 she published a major study on the role of women in American Indian traditions , arguing that Europeans had de-emphasized the role of women in their accounts of native life because of their own patriarchal societies . It stimulated other scholarly work by feminist and Native American writers .",

  "/wiki/Stagecoach_(1939_film)": "Stagecoach is a 1939 American Western film directed by John Ford and starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne in his breakthrough role . The screenplay by Dudley Nichols is an adaptation of The Stage to Lordsburg , a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox . The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory . Stagecoach was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley , in the American Southwest on the Arizona-Utah border , as a location , many of which also starred John Wayne . Scenes from Stagecoach , including a sequence introducing John Wayne 's character the Ringo Kid , blended shots of Monument Valley with shots filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth , California , RKO Encino Movie Ranch , and other locations . Similar geographic incongruencies are evident throughout the film , up to the closing scene of Ringo ( Wayne ) and Dallas ( Trevor ) departing Lordsburg , in southwestern New Mexico , by way of Monument Valley . The film has long been recognized as an important work that transcends the Western genre . Philosopher Robert B. Pippin has observed that both the collection of characters and their journey are archetypal rather than merely individual and that the film is a mythic representation of the American aspiration toward a form of politically meaningful equality . In 1995 , the film was deemed culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry . Still , Stagecoach has not avoided controversy . Like most Westerns of the era , its depiction of Native Americans as simplistic savages has been criticized as clear evidence of racism .",

  "/wiki/Ken_Kesey": "Kenneth Elton Kesey ( /\u02c8ki\u02d0zi\u02d0/ ; September 17 , 1935 - November 10 , 2001 ) was an American novelist , essayist , and countercultural figure . He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s . Kesey was born in La Junta , Colorado , and grew up in Springfield , Oregon , graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957 . He began writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University ; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later . During this period , Kesey participated in government studies involving hallucinogenic drugs ( including mescaline and LSD ) to supplement his income . Following the publication of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , he moved to nearby La Honda , California , and began hosting happenings with former colleagues from Stanford , miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures ( most notably Neal Cassady ) , and other friends collectively known as the Merry Pranksters ; these parties , known as Acid Tests , integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances . He mentored the Grateful Dead ( the de facto house band of the Acid Tests ) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career . Sometimes a Great Notion - an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner 's Yoknapatawpha saga - was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964 , although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus . In 1965 , following an arrest for marijuana possession and subsequent faked suicide , Kesey was imprisoned for five months . Shortly thereafter , he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill , Oregon , where he maintained a secluded , family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life . In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon - an experience that culminated in Caverns ( 1989 ) , a collaborative novel written by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym of O.U . Levon - he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as Esquire , Rolling Stone , Oui , Running , and The Whole Earth Catalog ; various iterations of these pieces were collected in Kesey 's Garage Sale ( 1973 ) and Demon Box ( 1986 ) .",
