It lies on the River Stour . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of St Augustine , who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent around the turn of the 7th century . The city 's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket , although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012 . A journey of pilgrims to Becket 's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales . Canterbury is a popular tourist destination : consistently one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom , the city 's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism . The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent . Many historical structures fill the area , including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century , the ruins of St Augustine 's Abbey and a Norman castle , and the oldest extant school in the world , the King 's School . Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and the St Lawrence Ground , home of the Kent County Cricket Club . There is also a substantial student population , brought about by the presence of the University of Kent , Canterbury Christ Church University , the University for the Creative Arts , and the Girne American University Canterbury campus . Canterbury remains , however , a small city in terms of geographical size and population , when compared with other British cities",

  "/wiki/Hampshire": "Hampshire ( /\u02c8h\u00e6mp\u0283\u0259r/ , /-\u0283\u026a\u0259r/ ( listen ) ; postal abbreviation Hants . ) [ note 1 ] is a county in southern England . The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974"
