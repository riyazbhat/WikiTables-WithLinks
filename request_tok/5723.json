They compete in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference . The club 's official name is le Club de hockey Canadien . The team is frequently referred to in English and French as the Habs . French nicknames for the team include Les Canadiens ( or Le Canadien ) , Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge , La Sainte-Flanelle , Le Tricolore , Les Glorieux ( or Nos Glorieux ) , Le CH , Le Grand Club and Les Habitants ( from which Habs is derived ) . Founded in 1909 , the Canadiens are the longest continuously operating professional ice hockey team worldwide , and the only existing NHL club to predate the founding of the NHL . One of the oldest North American professional sports franchises , the Canadiens ' history predates that of every other Canadian franchise outside football as well as every American franchise outside baseball and the National Football League 's Arizona Cardinals . The franchise is one of the Original Six teams , a description used for the teams that made up the NHL from 1942 until the 1967 expansion . The team 's championship season in 1992-93 was the last time a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup . The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times than any other franchise .

The other two WHA teams ( Birmingham Bulls and Cincinnati Stingers ) were paid to disband . The New York Islanders won their first Stanley Cup , defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games , in the finals . The season also marked the eighth and final season for the Flames in Atlanta before the franchise relocated to Calgary . The NHL would return to the Georgia capital in 1999 with the Thrashers , but that team would ultimately relocate away from Atlanta as well becoming the second ( and current ) incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets . The collapse of the WHA also saw the much hyped super-star rookie Wayne Gretzky come to the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers . Gretzky would tie Marcel Dionne for the scoring lead with 137 points and capture the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player while Dionne took home the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer by virtue of having scored two more goals . Gretzky aside , many players made their debut in the NHL this season , both due to the WHA merger and to a change in the rules for the Entry Draft allowing eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds to be drafted for the first time ; no fewer than seven Hall of Famers ( Gretzky , Ray Bourque , Mark Messier , Mike Gartner , Michel Goulet , Mark Howe , and an undrafted Joe Mullen ) debuted this season , along with numerous other perennial stars . The big story of the regular season was the record-breaking undefeated streak compiled by the Philadelphia Flyers . After starting the season with a 5-2 win over the New York Islanders and a 9-2 loss to the Atlanta Flames , the Flyers did not lose again for nearly three months , earning at least one point in every game between a 4-3 win over Toronto on October 14 , 1979 , and a 4-2 win over Buffalo on January 6 , 1980 , earning a 35 game record of 25-0-10 .",

  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins": "The Pittsburgh Penguins ( colloquially known as the Pens ) are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh . They compete in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) as a member of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference . The Penguins are one of two NHL franchises in Pennsylvania , the other being the Philadelphia Flyers . The cities ' proximity has led to a rivalry known as the Battle of Pennsylvania . The club is owned by Mario Lemieux and Ronald Burkle , who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy . The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league 's expansion from six to twelve teams . The Penguins played in the Civic Arena , also known as The Igloo , from the time of their inception through the end of the 2009-10 season , when they moved to the Consol Energy Center , which was later renamed PPG Paints Arena . The 1992-93 Penguins won the franchise 's first-ever Presidents ' Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season . In addition to their eight division titles , they have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals , winning the Stanley Cup five times - in 1991 , 1992 , 2009 , 2016 , and 2017 . Along with the Edmonton Oilers , the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among non-Original Six teams and sixth overall . With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017 , the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in 19 years ( since the 1997-98 Detroit Red Wings ) and the first team to do so since the introduction of the NHL salary cap . They also became the fifth team to accomplish this feat multiple times .",

  "/wiki/1996\u201397_NHL_season": "The 1996-97 NHL season was the 80th regular season of the National Hockey League . The Stanley Cup winners were the Detroit Red Wings , who swept the Philadelphia Flyers in four games and won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 42 years . The regular season saw a decline in scoring and rise in the number of shutouts to an all-time record of 127 . This trend continued into the playoffs , during which an all-time record of 18 shutouts were recorded . Only two players , Mario Lemieux and Teemu Selanne , reached the 100-point plateau during the regular season ( compared with 12 who reached the plateau in 1995-96 ) . Many factors , including fewer power plays , more calls of the skate-in-the-crease rule , fewer shots on goal and more injuries to star players than the season before , contributed to the reduction in scoring and skyrocketing in shutouts . Paradoxically , teams averaged more even-strength goals scored ( 174 ) than in 1995-96 ( 172 ) . This was the first time in 30 years - and in the entire expansion era - that the Boston Bruins had a losing record and missed the playoffs , ending a still-unsurpassed North American professional sports streak of 29-straight seasons in the playoffs .",
