Early in the site 's history , the location began as a circle of 48 large wooden posts known as a woodhenge . The woodhenge was later dismantled and a series of mortuary houses , platform mounds , mass burials and eventually the ridgetop mound erected in its place . The mound was the location of the beaded burial , an elaborate burial of an elite personage thought to have been one of the rulers of Cahokia , accompanied by the graves of several hundred retainers and sacrificial victims .",
  "/wiki/Cahokia": "The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site /k\u0259\u02c8ho\u028aki\u0259/ ( 11 MS 2 ) is the site of a pre-Columbian Native American city ( which existed circa 1050-1350 CE ) directly across the Mississippi River from modern St. Louis , Missouri . This historic park lies in western Illinois between East St. Louis and Collinsville . The park covers 2,200 acres ( 890 ha ) , or about 3.5 square miles ( 9 km2 ) , and contains about 80 mounds , but the ancient city was much larger . At its apex around 1100 CE , Cahokia covered about 6 square miles ( 16 km2 ) and included about 120 manmade earthen mounds in a wide range of sizes , shapes , and functions . In population , it may have briefly exceeded contemporaneous London . Cahokia was the largest and most influential urban settlement of the Mississippian culture , which developed advanced societies across much of what is now the central and southeastern United States , beginning more than 1,000 years before European contact . Today , Cahokia Mounds is considered the largest and most complex archaeological site north of the great pre-Columbian cities in Mexico . Cahokia Mounds is a National Historic Landmark and a designated site for state protection . It is also one of the 24 UNESCO World Heritage Sites within the United States . The largest prehistoric earthen construction in the Americas north of Mexico , the site is open to the public and administered by the Illinois Historic Preservation Division and supported by the Cahokia Mounds Museum Society . In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial , the Cahokia Mounds were selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component ( AIA Illinois ) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine , as one of AIA Illinois 's selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places .",

It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages ( suburbs ) linked together by loose trading networks . The largest city was Cahokia , believed to be a major religious center . The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley ( for which it is named ) . Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point . Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539-1540 ( when Hernando de Soto explored the area ) , with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century .",
  "/wiki/Monk's_Mound": "Monks Mound is the largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the Americas and the largest pyramid north of Mesoamerica . The beginning of its construction dates from 900-955 CE . Located at the Cahokia Mounds UNESCO World Heritage Site near Collinsville , Illinois , the mound size was calculated in 1988 as about 100 feet ( 30 m ) high , 955 feet ( 291 m ) long including the access ramp at the southern end , and 775 feet ( 236 m ) wide . This makes Monks Mound roughly the same size at its base as the Great Pyramid of Giza ( 13.1 acres / 5.3 hectares ) . The perimeter of its base is larger than the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan . As a platform mound , the earthwork supported a wooden structure on the summit . Unlike Egyptian pyramids which were built of stone , the platform mound was constructed almost entirely of layers of basket-transported soil and clay . Because of this construction and its flattened top , over the years , it has retained rainwater within the structure . This has caused slumping , the avalanche-like sliding of large sections of the sides at the highest part of the mound . Its designed dimensions would have been significantly smaller than its present extent , but recent excavations have revealed that slumping was a problem even while the mound was being made .",

Spiro was a major western outpost of Mississippian culture , which dominated the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries for centuries . Spiro Mounds is under the protection of the Oklahoma Historical Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . In the 1930s during the Great Depression , treasure hunters bought the rights to tunnel into Craig Mound - the second-largest mound on the site - to mine it for artifacts . They exposed a hollow burial chamber inside the mound , a unique feature containing some of the most extraordinary pre-Columbian artifacts ever found in the United States . These included works of fragile , perishable materials : textiles and feathers that had been uniquely preserved in the conditions of the closed chamber . The treasure hunters sold the artifacts they recovered to art collectors , some as far away as Europe . Some of these artifacts were later returned to regional museums and the Caddo Nation , but other artifacts have never been accounted for .

They spoke a language with no known close relatives , although it may be very distantly related to the Muskogean languages of the Creek Confederacy . The Natchez are noted for being the only Mississippian culture with complex chiefdom characteristics to have survived long into the period after the European colonization of America began . Others had generally declined a century or two before European encounter . The Natchez are also noted for having had an unusual social system of nobility classes and exogamous marriage practices . It was a strongly matrilineal kinship society , with descent reckoned along female lines . The paramount chief named the Great Sun was always the son of the Female Sun , whose daughter would be the mother of the next Great Sun .

  "/wiki/Greenstone_(archaeology)": "Greenstone is a common generic term for valuable , green-hued minerals and metamorphosed igneous rocks and stones which early cultures used in the fashioning of hardstone carvings such as jewelry , statuettes , ritual tools , and various other artifacts . Greenstone artifacts may be made of greenschist , chlorastrolite , serpentine , omphacite , chrysoprase , olivine , nephrite , chloromelanite among other green-hued minerals . The term also includes jade and jadeite , although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms . The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as chlorite , hornblende , or epidote . Greenstone minerals were presumably selected for their color rather than their chemical composition . In archaeology therefore , having a loosely applied general term is at least partially influenced by the observation that ancient cultures often used and considered these various green-hued materials as interchangeable . Greenstone objects are often found very considerable distances from the source of the rock , indicating early travel or trading networks . A polished jadeite axe head in the British Museum ( 4000-2000 BCE ) was found in Canterbury , Kent but uses stone from the Alps of Northern Italy , and objects from other parts of the world had travelled comparable distances to their findspots . Ancient China and Mesoamerica have special reputations for the prevalence and significance of greenstone ( particularly jade ) usage . Greenstones also figure prominently in the indigenous cultures of southeastern Australia , and among the M\u0101ori of New Zealand ( who knew greenstone as pounamu ) . Neolithic Europe also used greenstone , especially for prestige versions of axe tools , not made for use ; comparable jade versions of tools and weapons also appeared in the Olmec and other Pre-Columbian cultures and in early Chinese civilization .",
  "/wiki/Celt": "The Celts ( /k\u025blts , s\u025blts/ , see pronunciation of Celt for different usages ) are a collection of Indo-European peoples of Europe identified by their use of the Celtic languages and other cultural similarities . The history of pre-Celtic Europe and the exact relationship between ethnic , linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial . The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto-Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to another theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800-450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . It is thus that this area is sometimes called the Celtic homeland . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans-cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern-day Turkey . The earliest undisputed direct examples of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions beginning in the 6th century BC . Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names . Insular Celtic languages are attested beginning around the 4th century in Ogham inscriptions , although they were clearly being spoken much earlier . Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD . Coherent texts of Early Irish literature , such as the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge ( Cattle Raid of Cooley ) , survive in 12th-century recensions .",
