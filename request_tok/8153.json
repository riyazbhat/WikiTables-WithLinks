  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

Well into the 15th century , Machaut 's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets , including Geoffrey Chaucer . Machaut composed in a wide range of styles and forms . He is a part of the musical movement known as the ars nova . Machaut helped develop the motet and secular song forms ( particularly the lai and the formes fixes : rondeau , virelai and ballade ) . Machaut wrote the Messe de Nostre Dame , the earliest known complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass attributable to a single composer .

  "/wiki/Gustav_Mahler": "Gustav Mahler ( German : [ \u02c8ma\u02d0l\u0250 ] ; 7 July 1860 - 18 May 1911 ) was an Austro-Bohemian Romantic composer , and one of the leading conductors of his generation . As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century . While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question , his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect , which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era . After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners ; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers , a position he has sustained into the 21st century . In 2016 , a BBC Music Magazine survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in the top ten symphonies of all time . Born in Bohemia ( then part of the Austrian Empire ) to Jewish parents of humble origins , the German-speaking Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age . After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878 , he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe , culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera ( Hofoper ) . During his ten years in Vienna , Mahler - who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post - experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press . Nevertheless , his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors , particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner , Mozart , and Tchaikovsky . Late in his life he was briefly director of New York 's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic . Mahler 's \u0153uvre is relatively limited ; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part-time activity while he earned his living as a conductor . Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna , Mahler 's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces , symphonic choruses and operatic soloists .",

  "/wiki/Mughal_painting": "Mugal painting is a particular style of South Asian painting confined to miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums ( muraqqa ) . It emerged from Persian miniature painting ( itself partly of Chinese origin ) and developed in the court of the Mughal Empire of the 16th to 18th centuries . The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia , and spreading Muslim ( and particularly Persian ) arts and culture as well as the faith . Mughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures . Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums , and were more realistically depicted . Although many classic works of Persian literature continued to be illustrated , as well as Indian works , the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries , begun by Babur , provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts , such as the Padshahnama genre of official histories . Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits , events and scenes from court life , wild life and hunting scenes , and illustrations of battles . The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image ( mostly trimmed in the images shown here ) was continued , as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint .",

His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) and its sequel , the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) , the latter often called The Great American Novel . Twain was raised in Hannibal , Missouri , which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty .

He was the son of Araki Murashige , a prominent daimy\u014d of the Sengoku period who had been made to commit suicide , leaving Matabei to be raised with his mother 's family name , Iwasa . Matabei 's work was noted for its distinctive figures , with large heads and delicately drawn features , and he was effective both in colour and monochrome ink-wash painting , using an individual brush technique combining Tosa and Kan\u014d elements . Although trained by Kan\u014d Naizen of the Kan\u014d school , he was more influenced by the traditions of the Tosa school , and signed a late series of portraits of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals ( 1640 ) commissioned by the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Iemitsu for a temple as the artist Matabei of the later current from Tosa Mitsunobu .

Matisse is commonly regarded , along with Pablo Picasso , as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century , responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture . The intense colorism of the works he painted between 1900 and 1905 brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves ( wild beasts ) . Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906 , when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern . In 1917 , he relocated to a suburb of Nice on the French Riviera , and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting . After 1930 , he adopted a bolder simplification of form . When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting , he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage .

He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design , as was the dome , with some modification , after his death . Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive . In fact , two biographies were published during his lifetime .

He died , probably of cholera , at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire , where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the Crimean War .",

  "/wiki/John_Milton": "John Milton ( 9 December 1608 - 8 November 1674 ) was an English poet and intellectual , who served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell . He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval , and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , written in blank verse , widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written . Writing in English , Latin , Greek , and Italian , he achieved international renown within his lifetime , and his celebrated Areopagitica ( 1644 ) , written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship , is among history 's most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . His desire for freedom extended into his style : he introduced new words ( coined from Latin ) to the English language , and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations . William Hayley 's 1796 biography called him the greatest English author , and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language , though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death ( often on account of his republicanism ) . Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as a poem which ... with respect to design may claim the first place , and with respect to performance , the second , among the productions of the human mind , though he ( a Tory and recipient of royal patronage ) described Milton 's politics as those of an acrimonious and surly republican . Poets such as William Blake , William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy revered him .",
