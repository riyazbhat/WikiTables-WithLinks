  "/wiki/Maya_Bridge_at_Yaxchilan": "The Maya Bridge at Yaxchilan was a suspension bridge believed by academics to have been built by the Maya across the Usumacinta River , Chiapas , Mexico . If so , it would have been the longest bridge discovered in the ancient world , dating from its construction by the Maya civilization in the late 7th century at Yaxchilan . It was a suspension bridge with a more or less level deck . Now an archaeological site , Yaxchilan had long been known to include an unusual raised terrace beside the river and pier in the river ; these structures were long theorized to be the remains of a bridge . The Maya City-State of Yaxchilan , founded in the 4th century , became one of the most powerful Mayan kingdoms during the Maya Classic Period . During the height of its power the kings of Yaxchilan built gleaming temples , pyramids , and luxurious palaces clustered along the grand plaza extending along the shores of the wild Usumacinta River . This broad river , now separating Mexico from Guatemala , formed a large U-shaped bend ( or oxbow ) that encompassed the city of Yaxchilan . This natural barrier protected the city from invasion from outside forces . However , the river was in a high flood stage during the six month rainy season , during this time Yaxchilan became an island due to the swiftly flowing [ citation needed ] waters of the engorged river which encompassed the city . An all-weather passage across the treacherous river was a necessity in order to gain access to the farmlands to the north of the city . To survive and operate efficiently as the seat of power , Yaxchilan required a dependable passageway to provide an uninterrupted flow of traffic across the river on a year-round basis . It has been speculated that the Maya solved this urban transportation problem by constructing a 100-meter long suspension bridge across the wild river in the late 7th century .",
  "/wiki/Simple_suspension_bridge": "A simple suspension bridge ( also rope bridge , swing bridge ( in New Zealand ) , suspended bridge , hanging bridge and catenary bridge ) is a primitive type of bridge in which the deck of the bridge lies on two parallel load-bearing cables that are anchored at either end . They have no towers or piers . The cables follow a shallow downward catenary arc which moves in response to dynamic loads on the bridge deck . The arc of the deck , and its large movement under load make them unsuitable for vehicular , or railroad , traffic . Simple suspension bridges are restricted in their use to foot traffic . For safety , they are built with stout handrail cables , supported on short piers at each end , and running parallel to the load-bearing cables . Sometime these may be the primary load-bearing element , with the deck suspended below . Simple suspension bridges are considered the most efficient , and sustainable design , in rural regions , especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges .",

  "/wiki/Wheeling_Suspension_Bridge": "The Wheeling Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the main channel of the Ohio River at Wheeling , West Virginia . It was the largest suspension bridge in the world from 1849 until 1851 . Charles Ellet Jr. ( who also worked on the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge ) designed it and supervised construction of what became the first bridge to span a major river west of the Appalachian mountains . It linked the eastern and western section of the National Road , and became especially strategically important during the American Civil War . Litigation in the United States Supreme Court concerning its obstruction of the new high steamboat smokestacks eventually cleared the way for other bridges , especially needed by expanding railroads . Because this bridge was designed during the horse-and-buggy era , 2-ton weight limits and vehicle separation requirements now apply . The main span is 1,010 feet ( 310 m ) from tower to tower . The east tower rests on the Wheeling shore , while the west tower is on Wheeling Island . The east tower is 153.5 feet ( 46.8 m ) above the low-water level of the river , or 82 feet ( 25 m ) from the base of the masonry . The west tower is 132.75 feet ( 40.46 m ) above low water , with 69 feet ( 21 m ) of masonry . Detailed analysis of the bridge was conducted by Dr. Emory Kemp . The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15 , 1975 .",

Delegates from the Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia , which also included secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key border state during the war . It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) . While a portion of its residents held slaves , most of the residents were yeoman farmers , and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution .

The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915 . Proposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century , which eventually led to the construction of the current span designed by Washington Roebling . While construction started in 1870 , numerous controversies and the novelty of the designed construction process caused the actual construction to be prolonged over thirteen years . Since opening , the Brooklyn Bridge has undergone several reconfigurations , having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950 . To alleviate increasing traffic flows , numerous bridges and tunnels were built to the north and south . Following gradual deterioration , the Brooklyn Bridge has been renovated several times , with major renovations in the 1950s , 1980s , and 2010s .

  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",
  "/wiki/George_Washington_Bridge": "The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge spanning the Hudson River , connecting the New York City borough of Manhattan with the New Jersey borough of Fort Lee . The bridge is named after George Washington , the first president of the United States . The George Washington Bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , carrying over 103 million vehicles per year in 2016 [ update ] . [ a ] It is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , a bi-state government agency that operates infrastructure in the Port of New York and New Jersey . The George Washington Bridge is also informally known as the GW Bridge , the GWB , the GW , or the George , and was known as the Fort Lee Bridge or Hudson River Bridge during construction . The idea of a bridge across the Hudson River was first proposed in 1906 , but it was not until 1925 that the state legislatures of New York and New Jersey voted to allow for the planning and construction of such a bridge . Construction on the George Washington Bridge started in October 1927 ; the bridge was ceremonially dedicated on October 24 , 1931 , and opened to traffic the next day . The opening of the George Washington Bridge contributed to the development of Bergen County , New Jersey , in which Fort Lee is located . The upper deck was widened from six to eight lanes in 1946 . The six-lane lower deck was constructed beneath the existing span from 1958 to 1962 because of increasing traffic flow . The George Washington Bridge is an important travel corridor within the New York metropolitan area . It has an upper level that carries four lanes in each direction and a lower level with three lanes in each direction , for a total of 14 lanes of travel .",

It spans the Narrows , a body of water linking the relatively enclosed Upper New York Bay with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean , and is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows . The double-deck bridge carries 13 lanes of Interstate 278 , with seven lanes on the upper level and six on the lower level . The span is named for Giovanni da Verrazzano , the first documented European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River in 1524 . Engineer David B. Steinman proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s , and subsequent proposals were deferred over the next 20 years . A 1920s attempt to build a rail tunnel under the Narrows was aborted , as was another 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows . Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s , but the plans were again denied . In the late 1940s , urban planner Robert Moses championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city . Various issues delayed the start of construction until 1959 . The bridge opened on November 21 , 1964 , and a lower deck was opened in June 1969 to alleviate high levels of traffic . The New York City government began a $ 1.5 billion reconstruction of the bridge 's two decks in 2014 . The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has a central span of 4,260 feet ( 1.30 km ; 0.81 mi ) .",

When it opened , the bridge was the longest of its type in the world ; it was not surpassed until 1998 , with the completion of the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge , and is now the eleventh-longest . The bridge spans the Humber ( an estuary formed by the rivers Trent and Ouse ) , between Barton-upon-Humber on the south bank and Hessle on the north bank , connecting the East Riding of Yorkshire with North Lincolnshire .

By 2006 , the bridge carried an average of 120,000 vehicles per week . The toll was \u00a33.00 each way for cars ( higher for commercial vehicles ) , which made it the most expensive toll crossing in the United Kingdom . In April 2012 , the toll was halved to \u00a31.50 each way after the UK government deferred \u00a3150 million from the bridge 's outstanding debt .",
