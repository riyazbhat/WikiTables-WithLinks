The Unfairground deals with themes of love , loss and the passing of time and it has garnered strong critical endorsements for its author 's brutally honest ruminations on his tumultuous life . Ayers stated in a 2007 Sunday Times interview that it is very much a reflective album : lost love , lost feelings , lost sensibilities .

  "/wiki/Moog_synthesizer": "The Moog synthesizer is a synthesizer developed by the American engineer Robert Moog . Moog debuted it in 1964 , and Moog 's company R.A. Moog Co. ( later known as Moog Music ) produced numerous models from 1965 to 1980 . It was the first commercial synthesizer , and is credited with creating the analog synthesizer as it is known today . By 1963 , Moog had been selling theremins of his own design for several years . Recognizing a demand for more practical and affordable electronic music equipment , he began developing the Moog synthesizer , guided by suggestions and requests from composers including Herb Deutsch , Richard Teitelbaum , Vladimir Ussachevsky , and Wendy Carlos . The Moog synthesizer consists of separate modules - such as oscillators , amplifiers , envelope generators , filters , noise generators , ring modulators , triggers and mixers - which create and shape sounds , and can be connected via patch cords . It can be played using controllers including keyboards , joysticks , pedals , and ribbon controllers . Its oscillators can produce waveforms of different timbres , which can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds ( subtractive synthesis ) . Moog 's principal innovation was to use voltage to control pitch via a voltage-controlled oscillator . The synthesizer also introduced fundamental synthesizer concepts such as modularity and envelope generation . It was brought to the mainstream by Switched-On Bach ( 1968 ) , a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos . In the late 1960s , the Moog was adopted by rock and pop acts including the Doors , the Grateful Dead , the Rolling Stones , the Beatles .",

  "/wiki/Vinyl_record": "A phonograph record ( also known as a gramophone record , especially in British English ) , often simply record , is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed , modulated spiral groove . The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc . At first , the discs were commonly made from shellac ; starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common . In the mid-2000s , gradually , records made of any material began to be called vinyl records , or simply vinyl . The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century . It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912 . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the record left the mainstream in 1991 . Since the 1990s , records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale , and are especially used by disc jockeys ( DJs ) and released by artists in mostly dance music genres , and listened to by a growing niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century - 9.2 million records were sold in the US in 2014 , a 260% increase since 2009 . Likewise , sales in the UK increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 . As of 2017 , 48 record pressing facilities remain worldwide , 18 in the US and 30 in other countries .",

  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) . This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device .",

  "/wiki/LP_album": "An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc ( CD ) , vinyl , audio tape , or another medium . Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album ; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records played at \u200b33 1\u20443 rpm . Vinyl LPs are still issued , though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats . The audio cassette was a format widely used alongside vinyl from the 1970s into the first decade of the 2000s . An album may be recorded in a recording studio ( fixed or mobile ) , in a concert venue , at home , in the field , or a mix of places . The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years . This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately , and then brought or mixed together . Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live , even when done in a studio . Studios are built to absorb sound , eliminating reverberation , so as to assist in mixing different takes ; other locations , such as concert venues and some live rooms , have reverberation , which creates a live sound . Recordings , including live , may contain editing , sound effects , voice adjustments , etc . With modern recording technology , musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones ; with each part recorded as a separate track . Album covers and liner notes are used , and sometimes additional information is provided , such as analysis of the recording , and lyrics or librettos ."
