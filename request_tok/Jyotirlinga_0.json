Often , the word swayambhu is used to describe a self manifested image of a deity , otr ku ( Tibetan ) which was not made by human hands , but instead is naturally arisen , or generated by nature . Rangjung in Tibetan language or in Dzongkha expresses the concept of a self-arisen manifestation . Throughout the Tibetan cultural sphere there are sacred seed syllables , mantras or depiction of deities that a presumed not to be man-made , but rangjung , self arisen or autogenic . For example , in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa is a rangjung goat 's head in a side chapel protruding out of a big rock . The word etymology of swayambhu is 'Svayam ' ( \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u092e\u094d ) which means 'self ' or 'on its own ' and 'bhu ' ( \u092d\u0942 ) which means 'to take birth ' or 'arising ' . This is applicable to the physical and tangible idols of Gods that we see or to the intangible yet existing God whom we can not see . For example , the jyotirlingas are considered swayambhu- the idol of Venkateshwara at Tirumala and some other ones are considered Swayambu- which means they are not installed by any person but they exist on their own .

It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
  "/wiki/Hindu": "Hindus ( Hindustani : [ \u02c8\u0266\u026andu ] ( listen ) ) are persons who regard themselves as culturally , ethnically , or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism . Historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent . The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",

  "/wiki/Pandya_Naadu": "The Pandya Dynasty , also known as the Pandyas of Madurai , was a dynasty of south India , one of the three ethnically Tamil lineages , the other two being the Chola and the Chera . The rulers of the three dynasties were referred to as the three crowned rulers ( the mu-ventar ) of the Tamil country . The Pandyas ruled extensive territories , at times including the large portions of present-day south India and Sri Lanka ( through collateral branches subject to Madurai ) . The age and antiquity of the dynasty is difficult to establish . The early Pandya chieftains ruled their country ( the Pandya nadu ) from time immemorial , which included the inland city of Madurai and the southern port of Korkai . The country of the Pandyas finds mention in a number of Graeco-Roman sources ( as early as 4th century BCE ) and the edicts Maurya emperor Asoka ( 3rd century BCE ) . The Pandyas are also celebrated in the earliest available Tamil poetry ( the Sangam literature ) . Greek and Latin accounts ( early centuries CE ) , coins with legends in Tamil-Brahmi script , and Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions suggest the continuity of the Pandya dynasty from the 3rd century BCE to early centuries CE . The early historic Pandyas faded into obscurity upon the rise of the Kalabhra dynasty in south India . The Pandyas revived under Kadungon ( r. 590 - 620 CE ) towards the end of the 6th century , helped to establish the Kalabhras in south India .

There are over 100 caves at the site , all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills , 34 of which are open to public . These consist of 12 Buddhist ( caves 1-12 ) , 17 Hindu ( caves 13-29 ) and 5 Jain ( caves 30-34 ) caves , each group representing deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE , as well as monasteries of each respective religion . They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India . All of the Ellora monuments were built during Hindu dynasties such as the Rashtrakuta dynasty , which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves , and the Yadava dynasty , which constructed a number of the Jain caves . Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by royals , traders and the wealthy of the region . Although the caves served as monasteries , temples and a rest stop for pilgrims , the site 's location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region . It is 29 kilometres ( 18 miles ) north-west of Aurangabad , and about 300 kilometres ( 190 miles ) east-northeast of Mumbai . Today , the Ellora Caves , along with the nearby Ajanta Caves , are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India ."
