  "/wiki/Straits_of_Mackinac": "The Straits of Mackinac ( /\u02c8m\u00e6k\u026an\u0254\u02d0/ MAK-in-aw ) are narrow waterways in the U.S. state of Michigan between Michigan 's Lower and Upper Peninsulas . The main strait flows under the Mackinac Bridge and connects two of the Great Lakes , Lake Michigan and Lake Huron . The main strait is 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) wide and has a maximum depth of 295 feet ( 90 m ) . Hydrologically , the two connected lakes can be considered one lake , which is called Lake Michigan-Huron . Historically , the native Odawa people called the region around the Straits Michilimackinac . The Straits of Mackinac are whipsawed by currents unlike anywhere else in the Great Lakes . Islands forming the edge of Straits of Mackinac include the two populated islands , Bois Blanc and Mackinac , and one that is uninhabited : Round island . The Straits of Mackinac are major shipping lanes , providing passage for raw materials and finished goods and connecting , for instance , the iron mines of Minnesota to the steel mills of Gary , Indiana . Before the railroads reached Chicago from the east , most immigrants arrived in the Midwest and Great Plains by ships on the Great Lakes . The straits are five miles ( 8 km ) wide at their narrowest point , where they are spanned by the Mackinac Bridge . Before the bridge was built , car ferries transported vehicles across the straits . Today passenger-only ferries carry people to Mackinac Island , which does not permit cars",
  "/wiki/SS_Charles_S._Price": "The SS Charles S. Price was a steel hulled ship lost on Lake Huron on November 9 , 1913 during the Great Lakes storm of 1913 . The Price was found on 10 November 1913 with her bow above water , and her stern dipping below . Because of her disposition , the ship 's length could not be measured to make a positive identification of the vessel : the wreck was initially assumed to be the Regina . The vessel was eventually identified as the Price before she sank on 17 November . The salvage rights to the Price were sold to the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company . In the summer of 1916 , salvage of the Price was attempted . Divers cut a hole in the side of the aft hull . The hole allowed divers to enter the wreck . They attempted to seal breaks in the hull and built bulkheads so that the wreck could be floated . However , salvaging the wreck was eventually considered too costly to be worth the expense and the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company abandoned attempts to raise her . Salvage rights were eventually sold to the American Salvage Co. , but they too were unable to salvage the wreck",
  "/wiki/Great_Lakes_Storm_of_1913": "The Great Lakes Storm of 1913 , historically referred to as the Big Blow , [ A ] the Freshwater Fury , or the White Hurricane , was a blizzard with hurricane-force winds that devastated the Great Lakes Basin in the Midwestern United States and Ontario , Canada from November 7 through November 10 , 1913 . The storm was most powerful on November 9 , battering and overturning ships on four of the five Great Lakes , particularly Lake Huron . Deceptive lulls in the storm and the slow pace of weather reports contributed to the storm 's destructiveness . The deadliest and most destructive natural disaster to hit the lakes in recorded history , the Great Lakes Storm killed more than 250 people , destroyed 19 ships , and stranded 19 others . The financial loss in vessels alone was nearly US $ 5 million ( or about $ 129,343,000 in today 's dollars ) . This included about $ 1 million at current value in lost cargo totalling about 68,300 tons , such as coal , iron ore , and grain . The storm , an extratropical cyclone , originated as the convergence of two major storm fronts , fueled by the lakes ' relatively warm waters - a seasonal process called a November gale . It produced 90 mph ( 140 km/h ) wind gusts , waves over 35 feet ( 11 m ) high , and whiteout snowsqualls . Analysis of the storm and its impact on humans , engineering structures , and the landscape led to better forecasting and faster responses to storm warnings , stronger construction ( especially of marine vessels ) , and improved preparedness",
  "/wiki/SS_Choctaw": "SS Choctaw was a semi-whaleback freighter built by the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company in 1892 . She was a monitor vessel that was designed to evade Alexander McDougall 's patent on the whaleback vessel design . She sank on July 11 , 1915 , on Lake Huron after a collision with the Canadian package freighter Wahcondah .

  "/wiki/Georgian_Bay": "Georgian Bay ( French : Baie Georgienne ) is a large bay of Lake Huron , in the Laurentia bioregion . It is located entirely within the borders of Ontario , Canada . The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island . To its northwest is the North Channel . Georgian Bay is surrounded by ( listed clockwise ) the districts of Manitoulin , Sudbury , Parry Sound and Muskoka , as well as the more populous counties of Simcoe , Grey and Bruce . The Main Channel separates the Bruce Peninsula from Manitoulin Island and connects Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron . The North Channel , located between Manitoulin Island and the Sudbury District , west of Killarney , was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from Georgian Bay . The shores and waterways of the Georgian Bay are the traditional domain of the Anishinaabeg First Nations peoples to the north and Huron-Petun ( Wyandot ) to the south . The bay was thus a major Algonquian-Iroquoian trade route . Samuel de Champlain , the first European to explore and map the area in 1615-1616 , called it La Mer douce ( the calm sea ) , which was a reference to the bay 's freshwater . In 1822 , after Great Britain had taken over the territory , Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield of a Royal Navy expedition named it as Georgian Bay ( after King George IV )",
  "/wiki/Cornelia_B._Windiate": "The Cornelia B. Windiate was a schooner that sank in 1875 with all hands , presumably in Lake Michigan near the Straits of Mackinac . The ship was eastbound from Milwaukee to Buffalo . The reason for her sinking is unknown , but she departed November 27 , late in the season , and was overloaded with grain . In 1986 The Windiate was discovered by divers in Lake Huron , near Alpena , Michigan , further east than expected . The wreck is unique in that her cargo is still secure in her holds which is quite unusual for a wreck . Her masts are still standing with rigging",

It is shared on the north and east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the south and west by the state of Michigan in the United States . The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region . The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region . The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay . Across the lake to the southwest is Saginaw Bay . The main inlet is the St. Marys River , and the main outlet is the St. Clair River",

She was following the SS James Carruthers heading south on Lake Huron while carrying a load of iron ore when she and the Carruthers were caught in the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 . The Hydrus foundered and sank with a crew of twenty-four aboard on or around 8 November 1913 while heading for the St. Clair River . During the storm , waves were said to be 35 feet high along with wind gusts of 90 miles per hour . Five of the crew were found frozen to death in a lifeboat that washed ashore in Canada . The James Carruthers was also lost in the storm as well as the SS Argus , which was the sister ship of the Hydrus . The wreck of the Hydrus was located in the summer of 2015 by a team of shipwreck hunters led by David Trotter . The wreck is in over 160 feet of water , and is heavily encrusted with zebra mussels .

  "/wiki/Lake_freighter": "Lake freighters , or lakers , are bulk carrier vessels that ply the Great Lakes of North America . These vessels are traditionally called boats , although classified as ships . Since the late 19th century , lakers have carried bulk cargoes of materials such as limestone , iron ore , grain , coal , or salt from the mines and fields of the upper Great Lakes to the populous industrial areas farther east . The 63 commercial ports handled 173 million tons of cargo in 2006 . Because of winter ice on the lakes , the navigation season is not usually year-round . The Soo Locks and Welland Canal close from mid-January to late March , when most boats are laid up for maintenance . Crewmembers spend these months ashore . Depending on their application , lakers may also be referred to by their type , such as oreboats ( primarily for iron ore ) , straight deckers ( no self-unloading gear ) , bulkers ( carry bulk cargo ) , sternenders ( all cabins aft ) , self unloaders ( with self unloading gear ) , longboats ( for their slender appearance ) , or lakeboats , among others . In the mid-20th century , 300 lakers worked the Lakes , but by the early 21st century there were fewer than 140 active lakers . SS Edmund Fitzgerald , which sank in 1975 , became widely known as the most recent and largest major vessel to be wrecked on the Great Lakes",
