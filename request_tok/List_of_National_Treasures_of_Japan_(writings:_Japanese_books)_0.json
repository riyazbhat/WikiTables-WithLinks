The anthology is one of the most revered of Japan 's poetic compilations . The compiler , or the last in a series of compilers , is today widely believed to be \u014ctomo no Yakamochi , although numerous other theories have been proposed . The chronologically last datable poem in the collection is from AD 759 ( No . 4516 ) . It contains many poems from much earlier , many of them anonymous or misattributed ( usually to well-known poets ) , but the bulk of the collection represents the period between AD 600 and 759 . The precise significance of the title is not known with certainty . The collection is divided into twenty parts or books ; this number was followed in most later collections . The collection contains 265 ch\u014dka ( long poems ) , 4,207 tanka ( short poems ) , one tan-renga ( short connecting poem ) , one bussokusekika ( a poem in the form 5-7-5-7-7-7 ; named for the poems inscribed on the Buddha 's footprints at Yakushi-ji in Nara ) , four kanshi ( Chinese poems ) , and 22 Chinese prose passages . Unlike later collections , such as the Kokin Wakash\u016b , there is no preface . The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b is widely regarded as being a particularly unique Japanese work . This does not mean that the poems and passages of the collection differed starkly from the scholarly standard ( in Yakamochi 's time ) of Chinese literature and poetics",

  "/wiki/Commelina_communis": "Commelina communis , commonly known as the Asiatic dayflower , is an herbaceous annual plant in the dayflower family . It gets its name because the blooms last for only one day . It is native throughout much of East Asia and northern parts of Southeast Asia . In China , the plant is known as yazhicao ( simplified Chinese : \u9e2d\u8dd6\u8349 ; traditional Chinese : \u9d28\u8dd6\u8349 ; pinyin : y\u0101zh\u012bc\u01ceo ) , roughly translating to duckfoot herb , while in Japan it is known as tsuyukusa ( \u9732\u8349 , tsuyukusa ) , meaning dew herb . It has also been introduced to parts of central and southeastern Europe and much of eastern North America , where it has spread to become a noxious weed . It is common in disturbed sites and in moist soil . The flowers emerge from summer through fall and are distinctive with two relatively large blue petals and one very reduced white petal . The Asiatic dayflower plant serves as the type species for its large genus . Linnaeus picked the name Commelina in honour of the two Dutch botanists of the Commelijn family , using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them . Linnaeus described the species in the first edition of his landmark work , Species Plantarum , in 1753 . Long before the plant was studied in Europe , however , it had been used for generations in traditional Chinese medicine . The flowers have also been used in Japan to produce a dye and a pigment that was used in many world-renowned Ukiyo-e woodcuts from the 18th and early 19th centuries",

He was the most prominent of the poets included in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b , the oldest waka anthology , but apart from what can be gleaned from hints in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b , the details of his life are largely uncertain . He was born to the Kakinomoto clan , based in Yamato Province , probably in the 650s , and likely died in Iwami Province around 709 . He served as court poet to Empress Jit\u014d , creating many works praising the imperial family , and is best remembered for his elegies for various imperial princes . He also composed well-regarded travel poems . He is ranked as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals . \u014ctomo no Yakamochi , the presumed compiler of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b , and Ki no Tsurayuki , the principal compiler of the Kokin Wakash\u016b , praised Hitomaro as Sanshi no Mon ( \u5c71\u67ff\u306e\u9580 ) and Uta no Hijiri ( \u6b4c\u306e\u8056 ) respectively . From the Heian period on , he was often called Hito-maru ( \u4eba\u4e38 ) . He has come to be revered as a god of poetry and scholarship , and is considered one of the four greatest poets in Japanese history , along with Fujiwara no Teika , S\u014dgi and Bash\u014d",

He is best known as the principal compiler of the Kokin Wakash\u016b , also writing its Japanese Preface , and as a possible author of the Tosa Diary , although this was published anonymously . Tsurayuki was a son of Ki no Mochiyuki . In the 890s he became a poet of waka , short poems composed in Japanese . In 905 , under the order of Emperor Daigo , he was one of four poets selected to compile the Kokin Wakash\u016b , the first imperially-sponsored anthology ( chokusen-sh\u016b ) of waka poetry . After holding a few offices in Kyoto , he was appointed the provincial governor of Tosa Province and stayed there from 930 until 935 . Later he was presumably appointed the provincial governor of Su\u014d Province , since it was recorded that he held a waka party ( Utaai ) at his home in Suo . He is well known for his waka and is counted as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals selected by Fujiwara no Kint\u014d . He was also known as one of the editors of the Kokin Wakash\u016b . Tsurayuki wrote one of two prefaces to Kokin Wakash\u016b ; the other is in Chinese . His preface was the first critical essay on waka . He wrote of its history from its mythological origin to his contemporary waka , which he grouped into genres , referred to some major poets and gave a bit of harsh criticism to his predecessors like Ariwara no Narihira",

  "/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Shunzei": "Fujiwara no Shunzei ( \u85e4\u539f \u4fca\u6210 , 1114 - December 22 , 1204 ) was a noted Japanese poet and nobleman , son of Fujiwara no Toshitada . He was also known as Fujiwara no Toshinari or Shakua ( \u91c8\u963f ) ; in his younger days ( 1123-67 ) , he gave his name as Akihiro ( \u9855\u5e83 ) , but in 1167 , changed to Shunzei . He was noted for his innovations in the waka poetic form , and for his achievement in compiling Senzai Wakash\u016b ( Collection of a Thousand Years ) , the seventh Imperial anthology of waka poetry ; this work was at the behest in 1183 of the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa , who despite Shunzei 's low rank ( he was merely Chamberlain to the Empress Dowager , a nominal rank Miner describes as pitiably low ) , admired him . Go-Shirakawa 's trust in Shunzei is significant , as Imperial anthologies were landmarks in the poetic circles of the court , second to no other events in significance ; poets were literally willing to risk their lives just for the chance to have a poem included.The Tale of the Heike relates that Shunzei was compiling the Senzai Wakash\u016b during the Genpei War , and that Taira no Tadanori ( 1144-1184 ; he was on the opposing side , the one which did not hold the capital where Shunzei lived ) ventured into enemy territory to Shunzei 's residence , asking him to include a particular poem of his , and then managed to successfully escape back to his own forces without being apprehended . Shunzei eventually did decide to include Tadanori 's poem , but attributed it ( tactfully as Keene characterizes it ) to Anonymous . His son , Fujiwara no Teika , is considered one of the four best poets in Japanese history"
