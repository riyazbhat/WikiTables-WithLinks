It is divided into 11 municipalities and its capital city is Chetumal . Quintana Roo is located on the eastern part of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and is bordered by the states of Campeche to the west and Yucat\u00e1n to the northwest , and by the Orange Walk and Corozal districts of Belize , along with an offshore borderline with Belize District to the south . As Mexico 's easternmost state , Quintana Roo has a coastline to the east with the Caribbean Sea and to the north with the Gulf of Mexico . The state previously covered 44,705 square kilometers ( 17,261 sq mi ) and shared a small border with Guatemala in the southwest of the state . However , in 2013 , Mexico 's Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation resolved the boundary dispute between Quintana Roo , Campeche , and Yucat\u00e1n stemming from the creation of the Calakmul municipality by Campeche in 1997 , siding with Campeche and thereby benefiting Yucat\u00e1n .

  "/wiki/Cop\u00e1n": "Cop\u00e1n is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in the Cop\u00e1n Department of western Honduras , not far from the border with Guatemala . It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries AD . The city was in the extreme southeast of the Mesoamerican cultural region , on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region , and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples . Cop\u00e1n was occupied for more than two thousand years , from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic . The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya , perhaps to emphasize the Maya ethnicity of the city 's rulers . The city has a historical record that spans the greater part of the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers . Cop\u00e1n was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the southern Maya area . The city suffered a major political disaster in AD 738 when Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil , one of the greatest kings in Cop\u00e1n 's dynastic history , was captured and executed by his former vassal , the king of Quirigu\u00e1 . This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city , during which time Cop\u00e1n may have been subject to Quirigu\u00e1 in a reversal of fortunes . A significant portion of the eastern side of the acropolis was eroded away by the Cop\u00e1n River ; the river has since been diverted to protect the site from further damage",

The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala , to the southwest by El Salvador , to the southeast by Nicaragua , to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca , and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras , a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea . Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures , most notably the Maya , before the Spanish Colonization in the sixteenth century . The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language , along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture . Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic , although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability , and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere . In 1960 , the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice . The nation 's economy is primarily agricultural , making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country 's urban centers . Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625 , classifying it as a nation with medium development . When the Index is adjusted for income inequality , its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443 .

During the colonial period , the city was a rich and important port , but declined after Mexico 's independence . Campeche was part of the province of Yucat\u00e1n but split off in the mid-19th century , mostly due to political friction with the city of M\u00e9rida . Much of the state 's recent economic revival is due to the finding of petroleum offshore in the 1970s , which has made the coastal cities of Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen important economic centers .

It is a moderate sized ruined city of the Postclassic Maya civilization . The archaeological site and tourist attraction of Mixco Viejo was named after being erroneously associated with the Postclassic Poqomam capital referred to in colonial records by that name . The archaeological site has now been identified as Jilotepeque Viejo , the capital of the Chajoma Kaqchikel kingdom . To distinguish between the two , the ruins of the Chajoma capital are now referred to as Mixco Viejo ( Jilotepeque Viejo ) while the former Poqomam capital is referred to as Mixco Viejo ( Chinautla Viejo ) . This confusion in the identification of the site has hindered study . The Chajoma capital has been investigated archaeologically , under the assumption that it was the Poqomam capital . Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically , the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely . Doubts about the identification of the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack , who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels . The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production , but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations , and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco . Chinautla Viejo was attacked by the invading Spanish in 1525 ; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful . The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle , with the Spanish cavalry being decisive",

The site was first settled between 600 and 300 BC , in the latter portion of the Middle Preclassic period , when it most likely was a fairly small site . This Maya city then had a long and continuous occupational history until the Early Postclassic , up to around AD 1250 , with peaks in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods . Motul de San Jos\u00e9 had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century AD ; by the 7th century it had switched its allegiance to Calakmul , Tikal 's great rival , before returning its allegiance to Tikal in the early 8th century . In the late 8th century Motul de San Jos\u00e9 appears to have been conquered by Dos Pilas , capital of the Petexbat\u00fan kingdom .

The principal phase of occupation dates to the Late Preclassic ( 400 BC - AD 200 ) , followed by a decline in the Early Classic ( AD 200-600 ) . Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the Terminal Classic immediately prior to its complete abandonment , reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890 , with a population estimated at 8-10,000 people .

Many of Seibal 's late monuments show artistic influence from central Mexico and from the Gulf Coast of Mexico .

It is located in the archaeological region of the Pet\u00e9n Basin in what is now northern Guatemala . Situated in the department of El Pet\u00e9n , the site is part of Guatemala 's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BCE , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , c. 200 to 900 CE . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site 's abandonment by the end of the 10th century .
