  "/wiki/As_You_Like_It": "As You Like It is a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1599 and first published in the First Folio in 1623 . The play 's first performance is uncertain , though a performance at Wilton House in 1603 has been suggested as a possibility . As You Like It follows its heroine Rosalind as she flees persecution in her uncle 's court , accompanied by her cousin Celia to find safety and , eventually , love , in the Forest of Arden . In the forest , they encounter a variety of memorable characters , notably the melancholy traveller Jaques who speaks many of Shakespeare 's most famous speeches ( such as All the world 's a stage , too much of a good thing and A fool ! A fool ! I met a fool in the forest ) . Jaques provides a sharp contrast to the other characters in the play , always observing and disputing the hardships of life in the country . Historically , critical response has varied , with some critics finding the play a work of great merit and some finding it to be of lesser quality than other Shakespearean works . The play remains a favourite among audiences and has been adapted for radio , film , and musical theatre . The piece has been a favourite of famous actors on stage and screen , notably Vanessa Redgrave , Juliet Stevenson , Maggie Smith , Rebecca Hall , Helen Mirren , and Patti LuPone in the role of Rosalind and Alan Rickman , Stephen Spinella , Kevin Kline , Stephen Dillane , and Ellen Burstyn in the role of Jaques .",

  "/wiki/Hay_Fever_(play)": "Hay Fever is a comic play written by No\u00ebl Coward in 1924 and first produced in 1925 with Marie Tempest as the first Judith Bliss . Best described as a cross between high farce and a comedy of manners , the play is set in an English country house in the 1920s , and deals with the four eccentric members of the Bliss family and their outlandish behaviour when they each invite a guest to spend the weekend . The self-centred behaviour of the hosts finally drives their guests to flee while the Blisses are so engaged in a family row that they do not notice their guests ' furtive departure . Some writers have seen elements of Mrs Astley Cooper and her set in the characters of the Bliss family . Coward said that the actress Laurette Taylor was the main model . Coward introduces one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play , where the four guests tiptoe out as the curtain falls , leaving disorder behind them - a device that he also used in various forms in Present Laughter , Private Lives and Blithe Spirit .",
