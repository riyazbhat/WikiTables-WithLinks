  "/wiki/Pacific_War": "The Pacific War , sometimes called the Asia-Pacific War , was the theater of World War II that was fought in the Pacific and Asia . It was geographically the largest theater of the war , including the vast Pacific Ocean theater , the South West Pacific theater , the South-East Asian theater , the Second Sino-Japanese War , and the Soviet-Japanese War . The Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China had been in progress since 7 July 1937 , with hostilities dating back as far as 19 September 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . However , it is more widely accepted [ g ] that the Pacific War itself began on 7/8 December 1941 , when the Japanese invaded Thailand and attacked the British colonies of Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong as well as the United States military and naval bases in Hawaii , Wake Island , Guam , and the Philippines . The Pacific War saw the Allies pitted against Japan , the latter aided by Thailand and to a lesser extent by the Axis allies , Germany and Italy . The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and other large aerial bomb attacks by the Allies , accompanied by the Soviet Union 's declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and other territories on 9 August 1945 , resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945 . The formal surrender of Japan ceremony took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 . After the war , Japan lost all rights and titles to its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific , and its sovereignty was limited to the four main home islands and other minor islands as determined by the Allies . Japan 's Shinto Emperor relinquished much of his authority and his divine status through the Shinto Directive in order to pave the way for extensive cultural and political reforms .",
