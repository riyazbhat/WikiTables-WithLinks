  "/wiki/Homo_sapiens": "Homo sapiens is the only extant human species . The name is Latin for 'wise man ' and was introduced in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus ( who is himself the lectotype for the species ) . Extinct species of the genus Homo include Homo erectus , extant from roughly 1.9 to 0.4 million years ago , and a number of other species ( by some authors considered subspecies of either H. sapiens or H. erectus ) . The divergence of the lineage leading to H. sapiens out of ancestral H. erectus ( or an intermediate species such as Homo antecessor ) is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago . The earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appears in Africa around 300,000 years ago , with the earliest genetic splits among modern people , according to some evidence , dating to around the same time . [ note 1 ] Sustained archaic admixture is known to have taken place both in Africa and ( following the recent Out-Of-Africa expansion ) in Eurasia , between about 100,000 and 30,000 years ago . The term anatomically modern humans ( AMH ) is used to distinguish H. sapiens having an anatomy consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in contemporary humans from varieties of extinct archaic humans . This is useful especially for times and regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed , for example , in Paleolithic Europe . Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka )",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi )",

They probably went extinct due to competition with or extermination by immigrating modern humans or due to great climatic change , disease , or a combination of these factors . It is unclear when Neanderthals split from modern humans ; DNA studies have produced results ranging from 182 kya to more than 800 kya . The time of divergence of Neanderthals from their ancestor H. heidelbergensis is also unclear . The oldest potential Neanderthal bones are dated to 430 kya , but the classification is uncertain . Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils , especially from after 130 kya . The type specimen , Neanderthal 1 , was found in 1856 in the German Neander Valley . After much debate over their validity , Neanderthals were depicted as being primitive , stupid , and brutish for much of the early 20th century . Though knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific community , the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture . Compared to modern humans , Neanderthals were stockier , with somewhat shorter limbs and a larger chest and nose . These features are often explained as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate , but ( aside from body fat storage ) they are more likely products of genetic drift and adaptations for sprinting in the warmer , forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited . The braincases of Neanderthal men and women averaged about 1,600 cm3 ( 98 cu in ) and 1,300 cm3 ( 79 cu in ) respectively , which is within the range of the values for modern humans",

In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) .

In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning .

Making it , according to Ralph Holloway , one of the most famous specimens of Neanderthal skulls . The skull was found very high in the stratigraphy and was not only mixed with Upper Palaeolithic artefacts , but also with pottery from levels further above . Because of this the first two published dates of Amud 1 and other remains were not taken seriously when they suggested an extremely recent time ( by Neanderthal standards ) of 28,000 and 20,000 years . It has since been redated by ESR to about 55,000 years . Like other Neanderthal specimens in the Levant ( such as Tabun C1 and the Shanidar specimens ) , Amud 1 's skull is long , broad , and intermediate in cranial vault height as compared with European Neanderthals and modern humans . With a supposedly large nose and a big face , moderate midfacial prognathism , a small brow ridge and small teeth , Amud 1 exhibits an unusual mosaic of features compared to European Neanderthals . To the contrary of majoty of other Near Eastern and especially European Neanderthals , its brow ridges are slender and its chin , though still minimal by modern human standards , are somewhat developed . Although Amud 1 is considerably taller than any other known Neanderthal , its body is stocky , robust , and has short limbs , similarly to the cold-adapted bodies of Classic West European Neanderthals .

EEMH formed a genetically isolated population for more than 20,000 years , between c. 37 and 14 ka , with significant Mesolithic admixture from the Near East and Caucasus beginning from around 14 ka ( in some regions not before 12 ka ) . The description as modern is used as contrasting with the archaic Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis , who lived within Europe during about 400 ka to 37 ka , and who with the arrival of EEMH became extinct or absorbed into their lineage . The oldest known EEMH fossil remains , confidently dated to before 40 ka , were found at Riparo Mochi ( Italy ) , Geissenkl\u00f6sterle ( Germany ) and Isturitz ( France ) . Other known remains of EEMH can be dated to before 40 ka with some certainty : those from Grotta del Cavallo in Italy , and from Kents Cavern in England , have been radiocarbon dated to 43\u00b12 ka . A number of other early fossils are dated close to or just after 40 ka , including fossils found in Romania ( Pe\u0219tera cu Oase , 39.5\u00b12.5 ka ) and Russia ( Kostenki-14 , 37.5\u00b12.5 ka ) . The Siberian Ust'-Ishim man , dated to 45 ka , was not geographically found in Europe , and indeed is not part of the Western Eurasian genetic lineage , but intermediate between the Western Eurasian and East Asian lineages . The EEMH lineage in the European Mesolithic is also known as West European Hunter-Gatherer ( WHG ) . These mesolithic hunter-gatherers emerge after the end of the LGM c. 15 ka and are described as more gracile than the Upper Paleolithic Cro-Magnons . [ note 1 ] The WHG lineage survives in contemporary Europeans , albeit only as a minor contribution overwhelmed by the later Neolithic and Bronze Age migrations .

The River Danube , Europe 's second-longest river , rises in Germany 's Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857 km ( 1,775 mi ) , coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania 's Danube Delta . The Carpathian Mountains , which cross Romania from the north to the southwest , include Moldoveanu Peak , at an altitude of 2,544 m ( 8,346 ft ) . Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia . The new state , officially named Romania since 1866 , gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877 . Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914 , when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916 , Bukovina , Bessarabia , Transylvania as well as parts of Banat , Cri\u0219ana , and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania . In June-August 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union , and Northern Transylvania to Hungary . In November 1940 , Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and , consequently , in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side , fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944 , when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania",

  "/wiki/EEMH": "European early modern humans ( EEMH ) is a term for the earliest populations of anatomically modern humans in Europe , during the Upper Paleolithic . It is taken to include fossils from throughout the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) , covering the period of roughly 48,000 to 15,000 years ago ( 48-15 ka ) , spanning the Bohunician , Aurignacian , Gravettian , Solutrean and Magdalenian periods . EEMH formed a genetically isolated population for more than 20,000 years , between c. 37 and 14 ka , with significant Mesolithic admixture from the Near East and Caucasus beginning from around 14 ka ( in some regions not before 12 ka ) . The description as modern is used as contrasting with the archaic Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis , who lived within Europe during about 400 ka to 37 ka , and who with the arrival of EEMH became extinct or absorbed into their lineage . The oldest known EEMH fossil remains , confidently dated to before 40 ka , were found at Riparo Mochi ( Italy ) , Geissenkl\u00f6sterle ( Germany ) and Isturitz ( France ) . Other known remains of EEMH can be dated to before 40 ka with some certainty : those from Grotta del Cavallo in Italy , and from Kents Cavern in England , have been radiocarbon dated to 43\u00b12 ka . A number of other early fossils are dated close to or just after 40 ka , including fossils found in Romania ( Pe\u0219tera cu Oase , 39.5\u00b12.5 ka ) and Russia ( Kostenki-14 , 37.5\u00b12.5 ka ) . The Siberian Ust'-Ishim man , dated to 45 ka , was not geographically found in Europe , and indeed is not part of the Western Eurasian genetic lineage , but intermediate between the Western Eurasian and East Asian lineages . The EEMH lineage in the European Mesolithic is also known as West European Hunter-Gatherer ( WHG ) . These mesolithic hunter-gatherers emerge after the end of the LGM c. 15 ka and are described as more gracile than the Upper Paleolithic Cro-Magnons . [ note 1 ] The WHG lineage survives in contemporary Europeans , albeit only as a minor contribution overwhelmed by the later Neolithic and Bronze Age migrations . The term EEMH is equivalent to Cro-Magnon Man , or Cro-Magnons , a term derived from the Cro-Magnon rock shelter in southwestern France , where the first EEMH were found in 1868",
  "/wiki/Balangoda_man": "Balangoda Man ( Homo sapiens balangodensis ) refers to hominins from Sri Lanka 's late Quaternary period . The term was initially coined to refer to anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that were responsible for the island 's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture ' . The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP , and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP , which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia . Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP , which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools . Balangoda Man is estimated to have had thick skulls , prominent supraorbital ridges , depressed noses , heavy jaws , short necks and conspicuously large teeth . Metrical and morphometric features of skeletal fragments extracted from cave sites that were occupied during different periods have indicated a rare biological affinity over a time frame of roughly 16,000 years , and the likelihood of a partial biological continuum to the present-day Vedda indigenous people",

The island is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait . The legislative capital , Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , is a suburb of the commercial capital and largest city , Colombo . Sri Lanka 's documented history spans 3,000 years , with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years . It has a rich cultural heritage , and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka , the P\u0101li Canon , date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC . Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road . Sri Lanka was known in the west and from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon ( /s\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ , US also /se\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ ) . A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence , which was granted in 1948 ; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972 . Sri Lanka 's recent history has been marred by a 26-year civil war , which ended decisively when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in 2009 . The current constitution stipulates the political system as a republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system . It has had a long history of international engagement , as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , and a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the G77 , and the Non-Aligned Movement .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling . The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because Spain asserts a claim to the territory . Gibraltarians rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and , in a 2002 referendum , the idea of shared sovereignty was also rejected",

Its characteristics include a large nasal cavity and a somewhat less developed brow ridge and occipital bun , as might be expected in a juvenile . After discovery , the skull was dismantled , cast and reconstructed at least four times . During this process , the skull received considerable amounts of damage ; for example , after it was sold to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin , a dentist broke the alveolar bone to access the teeth . It was later damaged in the Allied bombing of Berlin during the Second World War , then looted by the USSR , which returned the remains of the skull to the German Democratic Republic in 1958 .
