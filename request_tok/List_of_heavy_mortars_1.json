  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",
  "/wiki/9_cm_Minenwerfer_M_14": "The 9 cm Minenwerfer M 14 ( Trench mortar ) was a light mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I . It was designed by the Army 's own Technisches und Administratives Milit\u00e4r-Komitee ( TMK ) in an effort to quickly satisfy the demand from the front for a light mortar . It had a number of issues with its ammunition , namely the black powder used as a propellant gave off copious smoke clouds on firing that revealed the tube 's location and the mortar bomb fuzes had a high rate of failure . The breech-loading mortar tube was mounted on a framework that did n't allow for any traverse , which meant that it was impossible to engage different targets without relaying the mortar . In turn the frame was mounted a rectangular firing platform . The M 14/16 had a circular platform to provide traverse and weighed only 65 kilograms ( 143 lb ) . A later model allowed the mounting to be collapsed for ease of transport . A new M 16 mortar bomb that used the German Poppenberg fuze system generally cured the dud problem , but it still used black powder as its propellant . This was a severe tactical disadvantage and it was decided to purchase replacement mortars from the German firm of Heinrich Lanz from 1917 .",
  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom . Austria-Hungary also became the world 's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances , electric industrial appliances and power generation apparatus for power plants , after the United States and the German Empire .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/9_cm_Minenwerfer_M_17": "The 9 cm Minenwerfer M 17 ( Trench mortar ) was a medium mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I . It was developed by the Hungarian Gun Factory to meet a competition held on 3 October 1917 to replace both of the earlier light mortars , the M 14/16 and the Lanz . Production was slow to ramp up and only ten weapons could be delivered in January 1918 . The first large deliveries were made in March 1918 , but the raw materials crisis and strained production facilities hindered the TMK 's plan to produce 2730 mortars by October 1918 . It was a breech-loading smooth-bore weapon that used a shotgun-like break-action to open the breech . This was arranged so that the barrel returned to the proper elevation to speed up the rate of fire . The carriage was mounted on a small metal rectangular firing platform with four carrying handles that permitted some amount of traverse . In Czech service the mortar was known as the 9 cm Lehky minomet vz . 17 and the German designation for captured Yugoslav mortars was 9cm Granatwerfer 309 ( j ) . Although still active in the Czech armory at the time of the German takeover there are no records of the Germans using it .",
  "/wiki/10_cm_Nebelwerfer_40": "The 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40 ( 10 cm NbW 40 ) was a heavy mortar used by Germany during the Second World War . Much like the American M2 4.2 inch mortar it was intended to deliver chemical munitions , such as gas and smoke shells , as well as ordinary high-explosive shells . It was derived from Rheinmetall 's Nebelwerfer 51 and 52 prototypes of the late Thirties which were attempts to develop a more accurate and longer-ranged mortar than the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35 . The NbW 40 is one of the better examples of German overengineering since it fired a slightly heavier bomb over twice as far as the NbW 35 , but weighed almost eight times more than the earlier model . It was an innovative breech-loading design with the wheels permanently attached to the carriage , from which it was fired , and which was n't disassembled for transport . It replaced the NbW 35 in ( German : Nebelwerfer smoke or fog-thrower ) battalions belonging to the Chemical Corps of the Heer ; exactly how the American fielded their own M2s in chemical mortar battalions . It was replaced by the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher from 1941 .",
  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",

Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war . In the Second Balkan War , Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north . The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire , which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe . Austria-Hungary , although not a combatant , became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples . The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a prelude to the First World War . By the early 20th century , Bulgaria , Greece , Montenegro and Serbia had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire , but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule . In 1912 these countries formed the Balkan League . The First Balkan War had three main causes :",
  "/wiki/Finnish_Civil_War": "The Finnish Civil War [ nb 1 ] was a civil war in Finland in 1918 fought for the leadership and control of Finland during the country 's transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state . The clashes took place in the context of the national , political , and social turmoil caused by World War I ( Eastern Front ) in Europe . The war was fought between the Reds , led by a section of the Social Democratic Party , and the Whites , conducted by the conservative-based Senate and the German Imperial Army . The paramilitary Red Guards , composed of industrial and agrarian workers , controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland . The paramilitary White Guards , composed of farmers , along with middle-class and upper-class social strata , controlled rural central and northern Finland . In the years before the conflict , Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth , industrialisation , pre-urbanisation and the rise of a comprehensive labour movement . The country 's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratisation and modernisation . The socio-economic condition and education of the population had gradually improved , as well as national thinking and cultural life had awakened . World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire , causing a power vacuum in Finland , and a subsequent struggle for dominance led to militarisation and an escalating crisis between the left-leaning labour movement and the conservatives . The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918 , supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia . A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March , reinforced by the German Empire 's military detachments in April . The decisive engagements were the Battles of Tampere and Vyborg ( Finnish : Viipuri ; Swedish : Viborg ) , won by the Whites , and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti , won by German troops , leading to overall victory for the Whites and the German forces .",

The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature .
