  "/wiki/Carrier_air_wing": "A carrier air wing ( abbreviated CVW ) is an operational naval aviation organization composed of several aircraft squadrons and detachments of various types of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft . Organized , equipped and trained to conduct modern US Navy carrier air operations while embarked aboard aircraft carriers , the various squadrons in an air wing have different but complementary ( and sometimes overlapping ) missions , and provide most of the striking power and electronic warfare capabilities of a carrier battle group ( CVBG ) . While the CVBG term is still used by other nations , the CVBG in US parlance is now known as a carrier strike group ( CSG ) . Until 1963 , Carrier Air Wings were known as Carrier Air Groups ( CVGs ) . Carrier Air Wings are what the United States Air Force would call composite wings , and should not be confused with U.S. Navy Type Wings ( such as Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic ) , which are primarily administrative and training commands composed of squadrons of the same type of carrier-based aircraft when not deployed . The United States Marine Corps equivalent command-level organization to a CVW is the Marine Aircraft Group ( MAG ) . However , MAGs are shore-based ( with sea-based capability ) and may contain any combination of aircraft squadrons and aviation support units . Carrier Air Wings integrate closely with their assigned aircraft carriers , forming a carrier/air wing team that trains and deploys together . There are currently nine U.S. Navy Carrier Air Wings , four based at Naval Air Station Oceana , Virginia , four based at Naval Air Station Lemoore , California , and one forward deployed to Naval Air Facility Atsugi , Japan . In 2017 , the air wing at NAF Atsugi began a phased move of its fixed wing ( VFA , VAQ , VAW ) squadrons to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni . The move is expected to take place over three years . The air wing 's helicopter squadrons ( HSC and HSM ) will remain at NAF Atsugi .",
