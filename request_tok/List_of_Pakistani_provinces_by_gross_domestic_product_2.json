  "/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( often abbreviated KP or KPK ) ( Pashto : \u062e\u06cc\u0628\u0631 \u067e\u069a\u062a\u0648\u0646\u062e\u0648\u0627 ; } ) , formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) ( Urdu : \u0635\u0648\u0628\u06c1 \u0633\u0631\u062d\u062f ) , is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan , located in the northwestern region of the country along the International border with Afghanistan . It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan 's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names . Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy , though it is geographically the smallest of four . Within Pakistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab , Balochistan , Azad Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad . It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan 's total population , with the majority of the province 's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers . The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb . On March 2 , 2017 , the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations , which are currently applicable to the tribal areas . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan ."
