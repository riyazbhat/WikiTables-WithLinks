Launched in 1983 as the national service First Choice , early difficulties and a subsequent industry restructuring led to its operations being restricted to Eastern Canada from 1984 to 2016 ; it changed its name to The Movie Network ( or TMN ) in 1993 . The service resumed national operations in 2016 , when it replaced the similar Movie Central offering in Western and Northern Canada .

With the changes , the pay television version of the service gained access to the on-demand library of the OTT version ( primarily original and acquired television series ) , while the OTT version added a second subscription tier , Movies + HBO - which adds content previously-exclusive to TMN ( such as films and first-run HBO programming ) , and is roughly equivalent to the service sold via linear television providers .
