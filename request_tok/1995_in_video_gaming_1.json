  "/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country": "Donkey Kong Country [ \u03b1 ] is a 1994 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , as part of the Donkey Kong franchise created by Shigeru Miyamoto . The game centers on the duo of Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong , who are on a quest to recover their stolen banana hoard from King K. Rool and his henchmen Kremlings . Development began shortly after Rare founders , brothers Tim and Chris Stamper , ran experiments with a Silicon Graphics ( SGI ) workstation to render 3D sprites . Nintendo became interested in Rare 's work and acquired 49 % of the company , leading to the production of a game for the SNES using Alias and SGI technology . The Stamper brothers expressed interest in creating a standalone Donkey Kong game and assembled a team of 12 developers to work on the game over 18 months . Donkey Kong Country is the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by the franchise 's creator Shigeru Miyamoto , though he was involved with the project . Following an aggressive marketing campaign , Donkey Kong Country received critical acclaim and sold more than nine million copies worldwide , making it the third best-selling SNES game and has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time . It was ported to the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance consoles , and was made available for Nintendo 's Virtual Console . Donkey Kong Country is the first game in the Donkey Kong Country series and was followed by two sequels on the SNES : Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy 's Kong Quest in 1995 , and Donkey Kong Country 3 : Dixie Kong 's Double Trouble ! in 1996 . In 2017 , the game was released as a part of the Super NES Classic Edition",
  "/wiki/Nintendo": "Nintendo Co. , Ltd. [ a ] is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto . Nintendo is one of the world 's largest video game companies by market capitalization , creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises of all-time , such as Mario , The Legend of Zelda , Animal Crossing , and Pok\u00e9mon . Nintendo was founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi and originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards . By 1963 , the company had tried several small niche businesses , such as cab services and love hotels , without major success . Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s , Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s . Supplemented since the 1980s by its major divisions Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe , it ultimately became one of the most influential in the video game industry and one of Japan 's most-valuable companies with a market value of over $ 37 billion in 2018",
  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers",
  "/wiki/NBA_Jam_(1993_video_game)": "NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game published and developed by Midway in 1993 . It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series .

The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals , another 2-on-2 basketball video game . However , it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre . The game became exceptionally popular , and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release , creating revenue of $ 1 billion in quarters . In early 1994 , the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time . The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast , action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism , a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football ( NFL Blitz ) , hockey ( 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge ) and baseball ( MLB Slugfest )",

Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts , each player has two life bars . The player that depletes the other player 's life bars first wins the match . The game also introduced auto-doubles , a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents . Also featured in the game are combo breakers , special defensive moves that can interrupt combos .

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter",

  "/wiki/Action_game": "An action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges , including hand-eye coordination and reaction-time . The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres , such as fighting games , beat 'em ups , shooter games and platform games . Multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered action games . In an action game , the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar . This player character must navigate a level , collecting objects , avoiding obstacles , and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal . At the end of a level or group of levels , the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game 's story . Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character 's health and lives , and the player receives a game over when they run out of lives . Alternatively , the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final goal , and see the credits . But some action games , such as early arcade games , are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels ; with the player 's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score",

The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s .

The third installment of the Mortal Kombat series retains the notorious extreme depictions of violence that defined the series . It also introduces new types of the finishing moves , including Animalities . Other features new to the series were combos , predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks . A Run button was also added , allowing players to briefly dash toward the opponent , as were Kombat Kodes , an unlockable content system using various symbols that can be entered before two-player matches to achieve certain effects .

  "/wiki/EarthBound": "EarthBound ( known as Mother 2 in Japan ) [ nb 1 ] is a role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The second entry in the Mother series , it was first released in Japan in August 1994 , and in North America in June 1995 . As Ness and his party of four , the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas . EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to . Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States , where it sold half as many copies as in Japan",
