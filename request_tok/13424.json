Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years .

At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 .
