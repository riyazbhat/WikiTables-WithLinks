  "/wiki/Bitterballen": "Bitterballen ( plural of bitterbal ) are a Dutch meat-based snack , made by making a very thick stew thickened with roux and beef stock and generously loaded with meat , refrigerating the stew until it firms , and then rolling the thick mixture into balls which then get breaded and fried . Seasonings in the base stew usually include onions , salt and pepper , parsley and nutmeg . Most recipes include nutmeg and there are also variations using curry powder or that add in finely chopped vegetables such as carrot . The ingredients are combined and cooked , then refrigerated for the mixture to firm up . Once firm , the filling is rolled into balls roughly 3 to 4 cm in diameter , then battered in a breadcrumb and egg mixture and deep-fried . They are typically served with a ramekin or small bowl of mustard for dipping . They are eaten in Suriname , the Netherlands Antilles , the Netherlands , Belgium , and to some degree in Indonesia . Bitterballen are very similar to the Dutch variant of kroketten ( plural of kroket ) in their ingredients and preparation/cooking methods , as well as flavour , though the larger kroketten have a distinct oblong sausage shape , but with a similar diameter . The bitterbal derives its name from a generic word for certain types of herb-flavoured alcoholic beverages , called a bitter in Dutch , and are popularly served as part of a bittergarnituur , a selection of savoury snacks to go with drinks , at pubs or at receptions in the Netherlands",
  "/wiki/Dutch_cuisine": "Dutch cuisine ( Dutch : Nederlandse keuken ) is formed from the cooking traditions and practices of the Netherlands . The country 's cuisine is shaped by its location in the fertile North Sea river delta of the European Plain , giving rise to fishing , farming ( for crops and domesticated animals ) , and trading over sea , its former colonial empire and the spice trade . Traditionally , Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward , with many vegetables and little meat : breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings like cheese , while dinner is meat and potatoes , supplemented with seasonal vegetables . The diet contains many dairy products and was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat , reflecting the dietary needs of the laborers whose culture molded the country . Without many refinements , it is best described as rustic , though many holidays are celebrated with special foods . During the twentieth century , Dutch cuisine and diet changed . Influenced by the eating culture of its colonies ( particularly the Dutch East Indies ) , it became more cosmopolitan and most international cuisines are represented in the major cities",

Myristica fragrans ( fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg ) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree cultivated for two spices derived from its fruit : nutmeg , from its seed , and mace , from the seed covering . It is also a commercial source of an essential oil and nutmeg butter . The California nutmeg , Torreya californica , has a seed of similar appearance , but is not closely related to Myristica fragrans , and is not used as a spice . If consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice , nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions , cause contact dermatitis , or have psychoactive effects .

  "/wiki/Carrot": "The carrot ( Daucus carota subsp . sativus ) is a root vegetable , usually orange in colour , though purple , black , red , white , and yellow cultivars exist . They are a domesticated form of the wild carrot , Daucus carota , native to Europe and Southwestern Asia . The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds . The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot , although the stems and leaves are eaten as well . The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged , more palatable , less woody-textured taproot . The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family Apiaceae . At first , it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot . Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months ( 90 days ) of sowing the seed , while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer ( 120 days ) . The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene , and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6 , but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities . The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) reports that world production of carrots and turnips ( these plants are combined by the FAO ) for the calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tonnes ; almost half ( ~45 % ) were grown in China . Carrots are widely used in many cuisines , especially in the preparation of salads , and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines",

  "/wiki/Potato": "The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas , a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum , and the plant itself , a perennial in the family Solanaceae . Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas , from the United States to southern Chile . The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations , but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes . In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia , from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex , potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000-10,000 years ago . In the Andes region of South America , where the species is indigenous , some close relatives of the potato are cultivated . Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish . Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world 's food supply . As of 2014 , potatoes were the world 's fourth-largest food crop after maize ( corn ) , wheat , and rice . Following millennia of selective breeding , there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes . Over 99 % of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile , which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes . The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing . It remains an essential crop in Europe , especially Northern and Eastern Europe , where per capita production is still the highest in the world , while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia , with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014",

Ready-to-eat cold cereals , appearing around the late 19th century , are most often mixed with milk ( traditionally cow 's milk ) , but can also be paired with yogurt instead or eaten plain . Fruit or nuts are sometimes added . Many breakfast cereals are produced via extrusion . Some companies promote their products for the health benefits that come from eating oat-based and high-fiber cereals . In the United States , cereals are often fortified with vitamins but can still lack many of the vitamins needed for a healthy breakfast . A significant proportion of cereals are made with high sugar content . Many are marketed towards children , feature a cartoon mascot , and may contain a toy or prize . Between 1970 and 1998 , the number of different types of breakfast cereals in the U.S. more than doubled , from about 160 to around 340 ; the forecasted trend for 2012 was 4,945 different types based on the mass customization of online shopping .

  "/wiki/Milk": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25 % since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946",

The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant . Almost all modern edible seedless ( parthenocarp ) bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana . The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata , Musa balbisiana , and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M. balbisiana , depending on their genomic constitution . The old scientific name for this hybrid , Musa sapientum , is no longer used . Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia , and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea .

A cr\u00eape is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles . A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a pala\u010dinke , a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam , cheese cream , chocolate , or ground walnuts , but many other fillings - sweet or savoury - can also be used . When potato is used as a major portion of the batter , the result is a potato pancake . Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries . When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk , the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake , which is common in Scotland and the US . Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter , making for a type of buckwheat pancake , a category that includes Blini , Kaletez , Ploye , and Memil-buchimgae . Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food",
  "/wiki/Wheat_flour": "Wheat flour is a powder made from the grinding of wheat used for human consumption . Wheat varieties are called soft or weak if gluten content is low , and are called hard or strong if they have high gluten content . Hard flour , or bread flour , is high in gluten , with 12 % to 14 % gluten content , and its dough has elastic toughness that holds its shape well once baked . Soft flour is comparatively low in gluten and thus results in a loaf with a finer , crumbly texture . Soft flour is usually divided into cake flour , which is the lowest in gluten , and pastry flour , which has slightly more gluten than cake flour . In terms of the parts of the grain ( the grass fruit ) used in flour - the endosperm or protein/starchy part , the germ or protein/fat/vitamin-rich part , and the bran or fiber part - there are three general types of flour . White flour is made from the endosperm only . Brown flour includes some of the grain 's germ and bran , while whole grain or wholemeal flour is made from the entire grain , including the bran , endosperm , and germ . Germ flour is made from the endosperm and germ , excluding the bran",

  "/wiki/Shellfish": "Shellfish is a colloquial and fisheries term for exoskeleton-bearing aquatic invertebrates used as food , including various species of molluscs , crustaceans , and echinoderms . Although most kinds of shellfish are harvested from saltwater environments , some are found in freshwater . In addition , a few species of land crabs are eaten , for example Cardisoma guanhumi in the Caribbean . Shellfish are among the most common food allergens . Despite the name , shellfish are not actually fish , but are simply water-dwelling animals . Most shellfish are low on the food chain and eat a diet composed primarily of phytoplankton and zooplankton . Many varieties of shellfish , and crustaceans in particular , are actually closely related to insects and arachnids ; crustaceans make up one of the main subphyla of the phylum Arthropoda . Molluscs include cephalopods ( squids , octopuses , cuttlefish ) and bivalves ( clams , oysters ) , as well as gastropods ( aquatic species such as whelks and winkles ; land species such as snails and slugs ) . Molluscs used as a food source by humans include many species of clams , mussels , oysters , winkles , and scallops . Some crustaceans that are commonly eaten are shrimp , lobsters , crayfish , and crabs . Echinoderms are not as frequently harvested for food as molluscs and crustaceans ; however , sea urchin roe is quite popular in many parts of the world , where the live delicacy is harder to transport",
  "/wiki/Fish_(food)": "Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world . Fish has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history . In culinary and fishery contexts , fish may include shellfish , such as molluscs , crustaceans and echinoderms . English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared from it , as it does with pig vs. pork or cow vs. beef . Some other languages do , as in the Spanish peces versus pescado . The modern English word for fish comes from the Old English word fisc ( plural : fiscas ) which was pronounced as it is today . English also has the term seafood , which covers fish found in the seas and oceans as well as other marine life used as food . Since 1961 , the average annual increase in global apparent food fish consumption ( 3.2 percent ) has outpaced population growth ( 1.6 percent ) and exceeded consumption of meat from all terrestrial animals , combined ( 2.8 percent ) and individually ( bovine , ovine , pig , other ) , except poultry ( 4.9 percent ) . In per capita terms , food fish consumption has grown from 9.0 kg in 1961 to 20.2 kg in 2015 , at an average rate of about 1.5 percent per year . The expansion in consumption has been driven not only by increased production , but also by a combination of many other factors , including reduced wastage , better utilization , improved distribution channels and growing demand , linked with population growth , rising incomes and urbanization . Europe , Japan and the United States of America together accounted for 47 percent of the world 's total food fish consumption in 1961 but only about 20 percent in 2015 . Of the global total of 149 million tonnes in 2015 , Asia consumed more than two-thirds ( 106 million tonnes at 24.0 kg per capita )",
  "/wiki/Cheese": "Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors , textures , and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein . It comprises proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep . During production , the milk is usually acidified , and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation . The solids are separated and pressed into final form . Some cheeses have molds on the rind , the outer layer , or throughout . Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature . Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries . Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and how long they have been aged for . Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents . The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto . Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black pepper , garlic , chives or cranberries . A cheesemonger , or specialist seller of cheeses , may have expertise with selecting the cheeses , purchasing , receiving , storing and ripening them",
  "/wiki/Vegetable": "Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food . The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter , including the flowers , fruits , stems , leaves , roots , and seeds . The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily , often by culinary and cultural tradition . It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits , flowers , nuts , and cereal grains , but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes , flowers such as broccoli , and seeds such as pulses . Originally , vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world , probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC , when a new agricultural way of life developed . At first , plants which grew locally would have been cultivated , but as time went on , trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types . Nowadays , most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits , and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations . China is the largest producer of vegetables , and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries . The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food , to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops . Depending on the type of vegetable concerned , harvesting the crop is followed by grading , storing , processing , and marketing . Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition , being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates , but high in vitamins , minerals and dietary fiber . Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables , five or more portions a day often being recommended",

  "/wiki/White_bread": "White bread typically refers to breads made from wheat flour from which the bran and the germ layers have been removed ( and set aside ) from the whole wheatberry as part of the flour grinding or milling process , producing a light-colored flour . This milling process can give white flour a longer shelf life by removing the natural oils from the whole grain . Removing the oil allows products made with the flour , like white bread , to be stored for longer periods of time avoiding potential rancidity . The flour used in white breads are bleached further - by the use of chemicals such as potassium bromate , azodicarbonamide , or chlorine dioxide gas to remove any slight , natural yellow shade and make its baking properties more predictable . This is banned in the EU . Some flour bleaching agents are also banned from use in other countries . In the United States , consumers sometimes refer to white bread as sandwich bread and sandwich loaf . White bread contains 1/2 of the magnesium found in whole-wheat bread",
  "/wiki/Egg_(food)": "Some eggs are laid by female animals of many different species , including birds , reptiles , amphibians , mammals , and fish , and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years . Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell , albumen ( egg white ) , and vitellus ( egg yolk ) , contained within various thin membranes . The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs . Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten . Fish eggs are called roe and caviar . Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline , and are widely used in cookery . Due to their protein content , the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid ( now MyPlate ) . Despite the nutritional value of eggs , there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content , salmonella contamination , and allergy to egg proteins . Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry . In 2009 , an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens . There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation , as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production . In 2012 , the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens",

This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food , such as the Japanese bunching onion ( Allium fistulosum ) , the tree onion ( A . \u00d7proliferum ) , and the Canada onion ( Allium canadense ) . The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species , but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation . Its ancestral wild original form is not known , although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions . The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant , but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season . The onion plant has a fan of hollow , bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached . The bulbs are composed of shortened , compressed , underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale ( leaves ) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem . In the autumn ( or in spring , in the case of overwintering onions ) , the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle . The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage . The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases , particularly the onion fly , the onion eelworm , and various fungi cause rotting",
  "/wiki/Wine": "Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes . Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol , carbon dioxide , and heat . Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine . These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape , the reactions involved in fermentation , the grape 's growing environment ( terroir ) , and the production process . Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine . These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes , as well as other aspects of wine production . Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops including , rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum , cherry , pomegranate , currant and elderberry . Wine has been produced for thousands of years . The earliest evidence of wine is from Georgia ( 6000 BC ) , Iran ( 5000 BC ) , and Sicily ( 4000 BC ) . In modern times , the five countries with the largest wine-producing regions are in Italy , Spain , France , the United States , and China . Wine has long played an important role in religion .

  "/wiki/Beer": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world . It is also the third most popular drink overall after water and tea . Beer is brewed from cereal grains - most commonly from malted barley , though wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are also used . During the brewing process , fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer . Most modern beer is brewed with hops , which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent . Other flavouring agents such as gruit , herbs , or fruits may be included or used instead of hops . In commercial brewing , the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and The Hymn to Ninkasi , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people . Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars . The brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . The strength of modern beer is usually around 4 % to 6 % alcohol by volume ( ABV ) , although it may vary between 0.5 % and 20 % , with some breweries creating examples of 40 % ABV and above . Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games",

Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War .

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions .

  "/wiki/Pancakes": "A pancake ( or hotcake , griddlecake , or flapjack , not to be confused with oat bar flapjacks ) is a flat cake , often thin and round , prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs , milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan , often frying with oil or butter . Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies . The pancake 's shape and structure varies worldwide . In England , pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a cr\u00eape . In North America , a leavening agent is used ( typically baking powder ) creating a thick fluffy pancake . A cr\u00eape is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles . A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a pala\u010dinke , a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam , cheese cream , chocolate , or ground walnuts , but many other fillings - sweet or savoury - can also be used . When potato is used as a major portion of the batter , the result is a potato pancake . Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries . When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk , the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake , which is common in Scotland and the US . Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter , making for a type of buckwheat pancake , a category that includes Blini , Kaletez , Ploye , and Memil-buchimgae . Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Greece": "Ancient Greece ( Greek : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , romanized : Hell\u00e1s ) was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity ( c. AD 600 ) . Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era . Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece , Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC , ushering in the Archaic period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin . This was followed by the period of Classical Greece , an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars , lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC . Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedon , Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea . The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic , which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece , and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire . Classical Greek culture , especially philosophy , had a powerful influence on ancient Rome , which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean Basin and Europe . For this reason , Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of modern Western culture and is considered the cradle of Western civilization . Classical Greek culture gave great importance to knowledge . Science and religion were not separate and getting closer to the truth meant getting closer to the gods . In this context , they understood the importance of mathematics as an instrument for obtaining more reliable ( divine ) knowledge . Greek culture , in a few centuries and with a limited population , managed to explore and make progress in many fields of science , mathematics , philosophy and knowledge in general",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Rome": "In historiography , ancient Rome is Roman civilization from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , encompassing the Roman Kingdom ( 753 BC-509 BC ) , Roman Republic ( 509 BC-27 BC ) and Roman Empire ( 27 BC-476 AD ) until the fall of the western empire . The civilisation began as an Italic settlement in the Italian Peninsula , traditionally dated to 753 BC , that grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the empire developed . The Roman Empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world , still ruled from the city , with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20 % of the world 's population at the time ) covering 5.0 million square kilometres at its height in AD 117 . In its many centuries of existence , the Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a democratic classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic semi-elective military dictatorship during the Empire . Through conquest , cultural , and linguistic assimilation , at its height it controlled the North African coast , Egypt , Southern Europe , and most of Western Europe , the Balkans , Crimea and much of the Middle East , including Anatolia , Levant and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia . It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece , and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world . Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language , religion , society , technology , law , politics , government , warfare , art , literature , architecture and engineering . Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France . It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats , such as the construction of an extensive system of aqueducts and roads , as well as the construction of large monuments , palaces , and public facilities . The Punic Wars with Carthage were decisive in establishing Rome as a world power . In this series of wars , Rome gained control of the strategic islands of Corsica , Sardinia , and Sicily ; took Hispania ( modern Spain and Portugal ) ; and destroyed the city of Carthage in 146 BC , giving Rome supremacy in the Mediterranean . By the end of the Republic ( 27 BC ) , Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond : its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa",

About 5.5 million Italians immigrated to the United States from 1820 to 2004 . In 1870 , there were fewer than 25,000 Italian immigrants in America , many of them Northern Italian refugees from the wars that accompanied the Risorgimento - the struggle for Italian unification and independence from foreign rule which ended in 1871 . Immigration began to increase during the 1870s , when more than twice as many Italians immigrated ( 1870-79 : 46,296 ) than during the five previous decades combined ( 1820-69 : 22,627 ) . The 1870s were followed by the greatest surge of immigration , which occurred between 1880 and 1914 and brought more than 4 million Italians to the United States , the greatest number coming from Southern Italy ( namely Campania , Apulia , Basilicata , Calabria and Sicily ) , areas which were still largely rural and agricultural , and where much of the populace had been impoverished by centuries of foreign misrule , and an oppressive taxation system imposed after Italian unification in 1861 . This period of large-scale immigration ended abruptly with the onset of the First World War in 1914 and , except for one year ( 1922 ) , never fully resumed . Further immigration was greatly limited by several laws Congress passed in the 1920s . Following the unification , the unitary Italian state initially encouraged emigration to relieve economic pressures in the South . After the American Civil War , which resulted in over a half million killed or wounded , immigrant workers were recruited from Italy and elsewhere to fill the labor shortage caused by the war . In the United States , most Italians began their new lives as manual laborers in eastern cities , mining camps and farms .
