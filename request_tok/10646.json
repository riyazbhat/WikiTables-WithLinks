US 9 is the longest north-south U.S. Highway in New York ; additionally , the portion of US 9 in New York accounts for more than half of the highway 's total length . The highway 's passage through the state offers a diverse sample of New York to a traveler , passing through busy urban neighborhoods , suburban strips , and forested wilderness . It is Broadway in Upper Manhattan , the Bronx and much of Westchester County , and uses parts of the old Albany Post Road in the Hudson Valley , where it passes the historic homes of a U.S. President ( Franklin Delano Roosevelt ) and Gilded Age heir . It passes the center of New York political power in downtown Albany , and the patrician grandeur of Saratoga Springs . It penetrates into the deep recesses of the Adirondack Park and runs along the shore of Lake Champlain , where it is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage . US 9 spawns more letter-suffixed state highways than any other route in New York , including the longest , 143-mile ( 230 km ) New York State Route 9N ( NY 9N ) .

Outside of the cities , it offers views of the Hudson Highlands , Shawangunk Ridge , Catskill Mountains , and , during an overlap with US 4 north of Albany , the Hudson River . The roads now making up the highway were originally part of several privately maintained turnpikes , which fostered settlements along the corridor . Once part of the former NY 58 , it has been NY 32 since 1930 . Only one of three letter-suffixed spur routes remains .",

The entire central campus is a national landmark and home to scores of historic sites , buildings , and monuments . The majority of the campus 's Norman-style buildings are constructed from gray and black granite . The campus is a popular tourist destination , with a visitor center and the oldest museum in the United States Army . Candidates for admission must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination , usually from a member of Congress or Delegate/Resident Commissioner in the case of Washington , D.C. , Puerto Rico , Northern Mariana Islands , Guam , American Samoa , and the Virgin Islands .

US 202 is the only road to cross New York between New Jersey and Connecticut and not pass through New York City on the way . As it does in other states , Route 202 serves mainly as a local road in suburban and exurban communities along the outskirts of the metropolitan area , mostly two lanes with the exception of some four-lane sections and a brief concurrency onto an expressway in Peekskill . Its course along the Hudson River takes it first north up the west side , over the historic Bear Mountain Bridge , then south along the east side . It takes in many scenic areas , such as the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands , and two New York City reservoirs . Its circuitous path across the state puts it on many concurrencies - only 14.5 miles ( 23.3 km ) , or 26 % , of Route 202 's mileage in New York is signed as US 202 alone . Among the roads it joins are three U.S. highways and two state routes .
