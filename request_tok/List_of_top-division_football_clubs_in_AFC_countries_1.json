  "/wiki/Kant": "Immanuel Kant ( UK : /k\u00e6nt/ , US : /k\u0251\u02d0nt/ ; German : [ \u026a\u02c8ma\u02d0nu\u032fe\u02d0l \u02c8kant , -nu\u032f\u025bl - ] ; 22 April 1724 - 12 February 1804 ) was an influential Prussian German philosopher in the Age of Enlightenment . In his doctrine of transcendental idealism , he argued that space , time , and causation are mere sensibilities ; things-in-themselves exist , but their nature is unknowable . In his view , the mind shapes and structures experience , with all human experience sharing certain structural features . He drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited a priori ( 'beforehand ' ) , and that intuition is therefore independent from objective reality . Kant believed that reason is the source of morality , and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment . Kant 's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy , especially the fields of epistemology , ethics , political theory , and post-modern aesthetics . In one of Kant 's major works , the Critique of Pure Reason ( 1781 ) , he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics . Kant wanted to put an end to an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience , while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as David Hume . Kant regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between rationalists and empiricists , and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought . Kant was an exponent of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation . He believed that this would be the eventual outcome of universal history , although it is not rationally planned . The nature of Kant 's religious ideas continues to be the subject of philosophical dispute , with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he was an initial advocate of atheism who at some point developed an ontological argument for God , to more critical treatments epitomized by Schopenhauer , who criticized the imperative form of Kantian ethics as theological morals and the Mosaic Decalogue in disguise and Nietzsche , who claimed that Kant had theologian blood and was merely a sophisticated apologist for traditional Christian faith",

Bishkek is also the most commonly administrative centre of the Chuy Region . The province surrounds the city , although the city itself is not part of the province , but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan . In 1825 Khokand authorities established the fortress of Pishpek to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes . On 4 September 1860 , with the approval of the Kyrgyz , Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress . In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name , Pishpek . It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast . In 1925 the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan , promoting Pishpek to its capital . In 1926 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze , after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze ( 1885-1925 ) , who was born there . In 1936 , the city of Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic , during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union . In 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital 's name to Bishkek",
