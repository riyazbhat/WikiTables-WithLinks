  "/wiki/Hakka_cuisine": "Hakka cuisine , is the cooking style of the Hakka people , who may also be found in other parts of Taiwan and in countries with significant overseas Hakka communities . There are numerous restaurants in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand serving Hakka cuisine . Hakka cuisine was listed in 2014 on the first Hong Kong Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage . The Hakka people have a marked cuisine and style of Chinese cooking which is little known outside the Hakka home . It concentrates on the texture of food - the hallmark of Hakka cuisine . Whereas preserved meats feature in Hakka delicacy , stewed , braised , roast meats - 'texturised ' contributions to the Hakka palate - have a central place in their repertoire . Preserved vegetables ( \u6885\u83dc ) are commonly used for steamed and braised dishes such as steamed minced pork with preserved vegetables and braised pork with salted vegetables . In fact , the raw materials for Hakka food are no different from raw materials for any other type of regional Chinese cuisine where what is cooked depends on what is available in the market . Hakka cuisine may be described as outwardly simple but tasty . The skill in Hakka cuisine lies in the ability to cook meat thoroughly without hardening it , and to naturally bring out the proteinous flavour ( umami taste ) of meat . The Hakka who settled in the harbour and port areas of Hong Kong placed great emphasis on seafood cuisine . Hakka cuisine in Hong Kong is less dominated by expensive meats ; instead , emphasis is placed on an abundance of vegetables",

Cuttlefish eat small molluscs , crabs , shrimp , fish , octopus , worms , and other cuttlefish . Their predators include dolphins , sharks , fish , seals , seabirds , and other cuttlefish . The average life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1-2 years . Recent studies indicate cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates . Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates . The cuttle in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species , cudele , which may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi ( cushion ) and the Middle Low German Kudel ( rag ) .

The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs . Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten . Fish eggs are called roe and caviar . Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline , and are widely used in cookery . Due to their protein content , the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid ( now MyPlate ) . Despite the nutritional value of eggs , there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content , salmonella contamination , and allergy to egg proteins . Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry . In 2009 , an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens .

  "/wiki/Instant_noodles": "Instant noodles are a noodle dish , sold in a dried and precooked noodle block , with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil . The flavoring is usually in a separate packet , although in the case of cup noodles , the flavoring is often loose in the cup . Some instant noodle products are seal packed ; these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet/container . Dried noodle blocks are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating , but can be consumed dry . The main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually wheat flour , palm oil , and salt . Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are salt , monosodium glutamate , seasoning , and sugar . The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles , and this is still the main method used in Asian countries , but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries . Instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando of Nissin Foods in Japan . They were launched in 1958 under the brand name Chikin Ramen . In 1971 , Nissin introduced Cup Noodles , the first cup noodle product . Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under many brand names .
