The season began on August 28 , 1991 , and ended on January 1 , 1992 . For the second consecutive season , there was a split national championship . Both the Miami Hurricanes and the Washington Huskies finished the season undefeated ( 12-0 ) and with the top ranking in a nationally recognized poll . Under the conference-bowl selection alignments of the time , the Hurricanes and Huskies could not meet in a decisive title game because Washington was slotted into the Rose Bowl as the Pac-10 champions , and the other spot in the Rose Bowl was automatically given to the Big Ten champions ( Michigan ) . The Rose Bowl 's selection terms later thwarted potential title matchups of undefeated teams following the 1994 and 1997 seasons . Following the 1998 Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) realignment , several Pac-10 and Big Ten teams were able to play in a BCS title game instead of being forced to play a non-title contender in the Rose Bowl ; these include the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2002 , 2006 and 2007 , the USC Trojans in 2004 and 2005 and the Oregon Ducks in 2010 . Miami closed the 1991 season with a 22-0 shutout over No . 11 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl , but their season was defined by a dramatic November victory over then No . 1 ranked and perennial rival Florida State . That game ended with the FSU place kicker missing a field goal , wide right , which would become a theme in the Florida State-Miami football rivalry ; this game later took on the moniker Wide Right I. Nebraska lost to both national champions in 1991 and finished at 9-2-1 , ranked No . 15 in the AP poll",

One of Bryant 's former players , Gene Stallings , was the head coach , and he used a style similar to Bryant 's , a smashmouth running game combined with a tough defense . The members of the Bowl Coalition were the Sugar Bowl , Orange Bowl , Cotton Bowl Classic , and Fiesta Bowl . Under the agreement the Sugar Bowl , Orange Bowl , and Cotton Bowl Classic hosted the Southeastern Conference , Big 8 , and Southwest Conference champions , respectively , and then a pool of at large teams was formed between the Atlantic Coast Conference champ , the Big East champ , Notre Dame , and two conference runners-up from the Big 8 , SWC , ACC , Big East and Pac-10 . The highest ranked host team would play the highest ranked at-large team . If the two highest ranked teams were both at-large teams , the championship game would be hosted by the Fiesta Bowl . So for this year , ( host ) SEC champ Alabama played ( at-large ) Big East Champ Miami-FL , the Orange Bowl featured ( host ) Big-8 champ Nebraska and ( at-large ) ACC champ Florida St. , the Cotton Bowl Classic featured ( host ) SWC champ Texas A & M and ( at-large ) independent Notre Dame , and the Fiesta Bowl featured ( at-large ) Big East runner up Syracuse and ( at-large ) Big 8 runner up Colorado . The 1992 season also saw the expansion of the SEC and the first conference championship game to be played in the country . Before the 1992 season , the Arkansas Razorbacks and the South Carolina Gamecocks joined the SEC , which expanded the conference to twelve teams . The conference then split into two divisions , and the winner of each division would face off in the SEC Championship Game in Birmingham 's historic Legion Field ( later moved to Atlanta 's Georgia Dome , in 1994 ) . In the first year of the new system , Alabama won the SEC West , Florida won the SEC East , and the Tide won the match-up 28-21 on an Antonio Langham interception return for a touchdown in the closing minutes .

Under the Bowl Coalition , undefeated Big 8 champ and # 2 ranked Nebraska hosted ACC champ and # 1 ranked Florida State in the Orange Bowl . This produced a clear champion in the Coaches Poll and the AP poll , despite Florida State 's loss to Notre Dame 31-24 during the regular season , in a game known by many as the Game of the Century . This much hyped clash between # 1 and # 2 was the site of the first ever live broadcast of the ESPN College GameDay show and did not fail to live up to expectations as Irish defensive back Shawn Wooden batted down a Charlie Ward pass in the end zone with three seconds left to play . Despite the win over Florida State , Notre Dame 's title chances ended the very next week when the Fighting Irish lost to # 17 Boston College . Further controversy surrounded the inclusion of one-loss Florida State in the national title game over undefeated West Virginia , who was ranked # 2 ( ahead of Florida State ) by the final regular season coaches ' poll but not the AP ( Nebraska was # 2 in the AP ) . Despite beating Florida State in the regular season , Notre Dame finished # 2 in the two major polls . Florida State , during the 1993 regular season played # 2 Notre Dame , # 2 Nebraska , # 3 Miami , # 7 Florida , # 13 North Carolina , # 15 Virginia , and # 17 Clemson .

This was the first national championship of coach Tom Osborne 's career at Nebraska , despite coming close in two prior attempts ; in 1983 , his team lost to Miami after Osborne , with his team trailing 31-30 late in the game , elected to try for the lead instead of the tie and failed . In the previous season , Osborne 's team lost to eventual national champion Florida State on a missed field goal as time expired . Although Osborne 's team finished the season unbeaten , the national championship picture again was engulfed in controversy . For much of the second half of the season , Nebraska and Penn State were regarded as the top two teams in the country . This raised the possibility of a split national championship for the third time since 1990 , due in large part to the system in place that had been concocted to avoid a split title . Following the 1991 season , where Miami and Washington split the national championship in the AP and Coaches ' polls , the Bowl Coalition was founded . The Coalition consisted of six bowls , with the Orange , Fiesta , Cotton , and Sugar bowls were all considered potential hosts for a national championship game . Since three of these bowls already had specific tie-ins with conferences , an agreement was struck where the conferences would agree to release those teams from their contractual obligations in order to achieve a # 1 vs # 2 matchup . For the first two years of the Coalition , this did occur without incident as the Sugar and Orange Bowls in 1993 and 1994 featured # 1 vs. # 2 matchups in their respective games",

Nebraska was showing signs of dynasty , playing in its third consecutive national title game , and became the first school to claim back-to-back titles since the 1970s . This was a dominant Nebraska team , averaging 52 points per game and a 39-point average margin of victory , including a 62-24 victory over Florida . This lopsided victory came after Florida was picked by many sportswriters to win the game . Ohio State almost created a national title controversy , going into its final regular season game against Michigan undefeated and ranked # 2 .

Florida had faced Florida State earlier in the year , when they were ranked # 1 and # 2 , and lost . Were it not for Texas beating Nebraska , then # 3 , in the first ever Big 12 Championship Game , Florida would n't have even been in the bowl game . And even once they were there , it was n't certain a victory would mean a national championship . The Rose Bowl game featured # 2 Arizona State and # 4 Ohio State . Florida St. and Arizona St. were the only unbeatens going into bowl season , so a Rose Bowl victory would give the Sun Devils a legitimate chance on winning the title . This scenario looked plausible as Arizona State 's Jake Plummer scored with 1:40 left to play in the game , making the score 17-14 . But Ohio State 's backup quarterback Joe Germaine marched down the field to pull out a heart stopping 20-17 win . On the one hand , this meant the national title game the following night would produce an incontrovertible champion . On the other hand , it left doubt to whether or not Ohio State deserved a stake in the national title , as evidenced by the team 's 1\u00bd first place votes in the final AP poll .

Tennessee defeated the Florida State Seminoles , 23-16 , in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Arizona , to secure the inaugural BCS National Championship . The BCS combined elements of the old Bowl Coalition and the Bowl Alliance it replaced .

The computer factored in things such as strength of schedule , margin of victory , and quality wins without taking into account time ( in other words , a loss early in the season and a loss late in the season were on equal footing ) .
