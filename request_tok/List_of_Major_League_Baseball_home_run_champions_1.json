The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs ( NL ) was formed in Chicago , Illinois by businessman , and owner of the Chicago White Stockings ( now known as , the Chicago Cubs ) , William Hulbert , for the purpose of replacing the NA , which he believed to have been corrupt , mismanaged , full of rowdy , drunken ballplayers , and under the influence of the gambling community . One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more . The initial NL season began with eight teams , and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21 . The NL is considered to be the first major league , although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim .",

Born in Virginia , he is credited with winning baseball 's first triple crown in 1878 ; the accomplishment was not noted at the time , as runs batted in would not be counted until years later , home runs were rare and home run leadership obscure , and Abner Dalrymple was then erroneously recognized as the batting champion . There is some controversy over whether Hines was also the first player to turn an unassisted triple play , since it was an 8-8-4 Triple Play . Hines probably practiced with the original Washington Nationals or played on its junior team before joining the National Association with that club in 1872 . When the original Chicago White Stockings resumed play in 1874 , the teenage Hines played every game , usually in center field . He remained with the club four seasons , including the inaugural National League championship season of 1876 , and then played eight seasons for the Providence Grays from 1878 to 1885 , spanning that club 's entire major league association , during which the club won two pennants . After the Providence club folded in 1885 , he remained an everyday major league center fielder through two seasons for a new Washington Nationals club and one for the Indianapolis Hoosiers , shifting to first base for a second Indianapolis season in 1889 . He returned to center field with gradually declining playing time for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys , Boston Beaneaters and Washington Statesmen in 1890 and 1891 . His last year in the major leagues was 1891 , but he continued to play baseball in minor leagues . He finished his professional career splitting 1896 between the minor league teams Burlington , Iowa and Mobile , Alabama , at the age of 41 .

He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run , the hook slide , and the catcher 's practice of backing up first base . In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 , the Old Timers Committee ( now the Veterans ' Committee ) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 . In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator , a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball - and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects - placed stress on the following : Kelly 's hook slide does sound special , and players probably tried to copy it . Also , he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base ( when the usually lone umpire was n't looking ) , at least according to the newspaper record . And , Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose . Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s . At the turn of the century , that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes . Kelly 's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888 , the first autobiography by a baseball player ; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. Jack Drohan . Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career , first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem Casey at the Bat , sometimes butchering it .",
