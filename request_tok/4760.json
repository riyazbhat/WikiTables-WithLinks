  "/wiki/Quarterback": "The quarterback ( commonly abbreviated QB ) , colloquially known as the signal caller , is a position in gridiron football .

  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States . Unlike most other sports in North America , no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football . Therefore , college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada ; one step ahead of high school competition , and one step below professional competition . However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually . Those not selected can still attempt to land an NFL roster spot as an undrafted free agent .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament .

Lindbergh was an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve , and he received the United States ' highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his transatlantic flight . His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail , which revolutionized the aviation industry , and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity . Lindbergh 's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy . In March 1932 , his infant son , Charles Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the Crime of the Century . The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim . By late 1935 , the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe , from which they returned in 1939 . Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany .

  "/wiki/Interior_lineman": "In gridiron football , a lineman is a player who specializes in play at the line of scrimmage . The linemen of the team currently in possession of the ball are the offensive line , while linemen on the opposing team are the defensive line . A number of NFL rules specifically address restrictions and requirements for the offensive line , whose job is to help protect the quarterback from getting sacked for a loss , or worse , fumbling . The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players . Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight , since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions ."
