  "/wiki/Curly_Lambeau": "Earl Louis Curly Lambeau ( April 9 , 1898 - June 1 , 1965 ) was a professional American football player and coach in the National Football League ( NFL ) . Lambeau , along with his friend and fellow Green Bay , Wisconsin native George Whitney Calhoun , founded the Green Bay Packers in 1919 . From 1919 to 1929 , Lambeau served as a player-coach and maintained de facto control on the day-to-day operations of the team . As a player , Lambeau lined up as a halfback , which in the early years of the NFL was the premier position . He was the team 's primary runner and passer , accounting for 35 touchdowns ( eight as a rusher , three as a receiver , and 24 as a passer ) in 77 games . He won his only NFL championship as a player in 1929 . From 1919 to 1949 , Lambeau was the head coach and general manager of the Packers . He led his team to over 200 wins and six NFL championships , including three straight from 1929 to 1931 . He shares the distinction with rival George Halas of the Chicago Bears and later , Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots of coaching his team to the most NFL championships . Lambeau also coached eight players who went on to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame . With players such as quarterback Arnie Herber and split end Don Hutson , his teams revolutionized the use of the passing game in football . After a falling out with the Packers Board of Directors , Lambeau left the Packers to coach the Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins , each for two seasons , before retiring in 1953 .",
  "/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)": "A halfback ( HB ) is an offensive position in American football , whose duties involve lining up in the backfield and carrying the ball on most rushing plays , i.e . a running back . When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield , and especially when that player is placed behind another player ( usually a blocking back ) , as in the I formation , that player is instead referred to as a tailback ( see History below ) . The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field , and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team 's success . Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",

  "/wiki/General_Manager": "A general manager or GM is an executive who has overall responsibility for managing both the revenue and cost elements of a company 's income statement , known as profit & loss ( P & L ) responsibility . A general manager usually oversees most or all of the firm 's marketing and sales functions as well as the day-to-day operations of the business . Frequently , the general manager is responsible for effective planning , delegating , coordinating , staffing , organizing , and decision making to attain desirable profit making results for an organization ( Sayles 1979 ) . In many cases , the general manager of a business is given a different formal title or titles . Most corporate managers holding the titles of chief executive officer ( CEO ) or president , for example , are the general managers of their respective businesses . More rarely , the chief financial officer ( CFO ) , chief operating officer ( COO ) , or chief marketing officer ( CMO ) will act as the general manager of the business . Depending on the company , individuals with the title managing director , regional vice president , country manager , product manager , branch manager , or segment manager may also have general management responsibilities . In large companies , many vice presidents will have the title of general manager when they have the full set of responsibility for the function in that particular area of the business and are often titled vice president and general manager . In technology companies , general managers are often given the title of product manager . In consumer products companies , general managers are often given the title brand manager or category manager . In professional services firms , the general manager may hold titles such as managing partner , senior partner , or managing director .",

  "/wiki/Offensive_tackle": "Tackle is a playing position in gridiron football .

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",
  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

This generally happens on a fourth down in American football and a third down in Canadian football . Punters may also occasionally take part in fake punts in those same situations , when they throw or run the football instead of punting .",
