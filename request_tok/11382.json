  "/wiki/Mary_Magdalene": "Mary Magdalene , [ a ] sometimes called simply the Magdalene or the Madeleine , was a Jewish woman who , according to the four canonical gospels , traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion , burial , and resurrection . She is mentioned by name 12 times in the canonical gospels , more than most of the apostles and more than any other non-family woman in the Gospels . According to many mainstream scholars , Mary 's epithet Magdalene may mean that she came from the town of Magdala , a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee . The Gospel of Luke 8:2-3 lists Mary as one of the women who traveled with Jesus and helped support his ministry out of their resources , indicating that she was probably relatively wealthy . The same passage also states that seven demons had been driven out of her , a statement which is repeated in the longer ending of Mark . In all four canonical gospels , she is a witness to the crucifixion of Jesus and , in the Synoptic Gospels , she is also present at his burial . All four gospels identify her , either alone or as a member of a larger group of women which includes Jesus 's mother , as the first witness to the empty tomb , and the first to testify to Jesus 's resurrection . For these reasons , she is known in many Christian traditions as the apostle to the apostles . Mary is a central figure in later apocryphal Gnostic Christian writings , including the Dialogue of the Savior , the Pistis Sophia , the Gospel of Thomas , the Gospel of Philip , and the Gospel of Mary . These texts , which scholars do not regard as containing accurate historical information , portray her as Jesus 's closest disciple and the only one who truly understood his teachings . In the Gnostic gospels , Mary Magdalene 's closeness to Jesus results in tension with the other disciples , particularly Simon Peter . In a series of Easter sermons delivered in 581 , Pope Gregory I conflated Mary Magdalene , who is introduced in Luke 8:2 , with Mary of Bethany ( Luke 10:39 ) and the unnamed sinful woman who anoints Jesus 's feet in Luke 7:36-50 .",
