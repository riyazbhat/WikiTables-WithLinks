  "/wiki/Bagel": "A bagel ( Yiddish : \u05d1\u05f2\u05d2\u05dc beygl ; Polish : bajgiel ) , also historically spelled beigel , is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland . It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough , roughly hand-sized , that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked . The result is a dense , chewy , doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior . Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust , with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds . Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface , and there are different dough types , such as whole-grain or rye . Bagels are eaten toasted or untoasted . Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure , it is known that they were widely consumed by Ashkenazi Jews from the 17th century . The first known mention of the bagel , in 1610 , was in Jewish community ordinances in Krak\u00f3w , Poland . Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America , especially in cities with a large Jewish population , many with alternative ways of making them . Like other bakery products , bagels are available ( fresh or frozen , often in many flavors ) in many major supermarkets in those cities . The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing more even cooking and baking of the dough : The hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels , allowing easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays",

It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions , covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres ( 120,733 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With a population of nearly 38.5 million people , Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union . Poland 's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw . Other major cities include Krak\u00f3w , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , Wroc\u0142aw , Pozna\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk , and Szczecin . Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791",
  "/wiki/Bread": "Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water , usually by baking . Throughout recorded history it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world and is one of the oldest man-made foods , having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture . Bread may be leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring sourdough microbes , chemicals , industrially produced yeast , or high-pressure aeration . Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor , texture , color , shelf life , nutrition , and ease of manufacturing . Bread plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture",
  "/wiki/Yeast": "Yeasts are eukaryotic , single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom . The first yeast originated hundreds of millions of years ago , and at least 1,500 species are currently recognized . They are estimated to constitute 1 % of all described fungal species . Yeasts are unicellular organisms that evolved from multicellular ancestors , with some species having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae . Yeast sizes vary greatly , depending on species and environment , typically measuring 3-4 \u00b5m in diameter , although some yeasts can grow to 40 \u00b5m in size . Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis , and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding . With their single-celled growth habit , yeasts can be contrasted with molds , which grow hyphae . Fungal species that can take both forms ( depending on temperature or other conditions ) are called dimorphic fungi . The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols in a process known as fermentation . The products of this reaction have been used in baking and the production of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years . S. cerevisiae is also an important model organism in modern cell biology research , and is one of the most thoroughly studied eukaryotic microorganisms . Researchers have cultured it in order to understand the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology in great detail",
  "/wiki/Wheat": "Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed , a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food . The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum ; the most widely grown is common wheat ( T. aestivum ) . The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE . Botanically , the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis . Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop ( 220.4 million hectares , 2014 ) . World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined . In 2017 , world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes , with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes , making it the second most-produced cereal after maize . Since 1960 , world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century . Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins , which facilitate the production of processed foods , whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet . Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates . Globally , it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food , having a protein content of about 13 % , which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids . When eaten as the whole grain , wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic",

  "/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists": "UNESCO established its Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage with the aim of ensuring better protection of important intangible cultural heritages worldwide and the awareness of their significance . This list is published by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage , the members of which are elected by State Parties meeting in a General Assembly . Through a compendium of the different oral and intangible treasures of humankind worldwide , the programme aims to draw attention to the importance of safeguarding intangible heritage , which UNESCO has identified as an essential component and as a repository of cultural diversity and of creative expression . The list was established in 2008 when the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage took effect . As of 2010 [ update ] the programme compiles two lists . The longer , Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity , comprises cultural practices and expressions [ that ] help demonstrate the diversity of this heritage and raise awareness about its importance . The shorter , List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding , is composed of those cultural elements that concerned communities and countries consider to require urgent measures to keep them alive . In 2013 four elements were inscribed on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding , which helps States Parties mobilize international cooperation and assistance to ensure the transmission of this heritage with the participation of the concerned communities . The Urgent Safeguarding List now numbers 35 elements . The Committee [ which ? ] also inscribed 25 elements on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity , which serves to raise awareness of intangible heritage and provide recognition to communities traditions and know-how that reflect their cultural diversity . The List does not attribute or recognize any standard of excellence or exclusivity",

Rice flour , or legumes such as beans or lentils , are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture , or as a gluten-free alternative . Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine . Pastas are divided into two broad categories : dried ( pasta secca ) and fresh ( pasta fresca ) . Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process , although it can be produced at home . Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand , sometimes with the aid of simple machines . Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines . Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties , with 310 specific forms known by over 1300 documented names . In Italy , the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale . For example , the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region . Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes , tubes , flat shapes or sheets , miniature shapes for soup , those meant to be filled or stuffed , and specialty or decorative shapes . As a category in Italian cuisine , both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes : as pasta asciutta ( or pastasciutta ) , cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary side sauce or condiment ; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo , in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish",

  "/wiki/Totopo": "Totopo , in Mexican cuisine , is a flat , round , or triangular corn product similar to a tortilla , that has been toasted , fried or baked , but it may be prepared with nixtamalized corn masa . Totopos are best known as originating from Zapotec peoples of the isthmus of Tehuantepec region of the Mexican state of Oaxaca . There , the Zapotec women bake totopos in a clay oven known as a comixcal . Totopos resemble a round , baked tortilla chip or certain types of Scandinavian flat bread , however , unlike tortillas , salt is added to the masa and holes are made in the disk prior to baking . Totopo may also refer to triangular fried tortillas ( totopos de maiz ) , which are essentially Tortilla chips . When the whole round tortilla is baked or fried it is generally known as a tostada . An important feature of the baking and salting process is preservation . To prevent the decomposition of the corn and growth of mold , regular tortillas generally need to be eaten the same day as they are made ( or stored cold ) due to the moisture content , whereas totopos may be stored for future consumption , in the same manner as dry crackers . In some cases , fried tortilla chips commercially made both in Mexico and the United States are labeled as or referred to as totopos , although they are not made in the manner of the Oaxacan totopo",
