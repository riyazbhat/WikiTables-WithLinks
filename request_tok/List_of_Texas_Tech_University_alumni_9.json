  "/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_Justice": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion",

Chartered in February 1859 , the railroad reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo , Colorado , in 1876 . To create a demand for its services , the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farmland from the land grants that it was awarded by Congress . Despite the namesake , its mainline did not directly serve Santa Fe , due to the mountainous terrain , the metropolitan city of Albuquerque instead served New Mexico and the Santa Fe area . The Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport , an enterprise that ( at one time or another ) included a tugboat fleet and an airline , the short-lived Santa Fe Skyway . Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail , and ferryboats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travelers to complete their westward journeys to the Pacific Ocean . The AT & SF was the subject of a popular song , Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer 's On the Atchison , Topeka and the Santa Fe , written for the film , The Harvey Girls ( 1946 ) . The railroad officially ceased operations on December 31 , 1996 , when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway",

Despite its name , it ceased regulating railroads in 2005 . Established by the Texas Legislature in 1891 , it is the state 's oldest regulatory agency and began as part of the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era .

In 1984 , the federal government took over transportation regulation for railroads , trucking and buses , but the Railroad Commission kept its name . With an annual budget of $ 79 million , it now focuses entirely on oil , gas , mining , propane , and pipelines , setting allocations for production each month . The three-member commission was initially appointed by the governor , but an amendment to the state 's constitution in 1894 established the commissioners as elected officials who serve overlapping six-year terms , like the sequence in the U.S. Senate , elected statewide . No specific seat is designated as chairman ; the commissioners choose the chairman from among themselves . Normally the commissioner who faces reelection is the chairman for the preceding two years .
