  "/wiki/Dorset": "Dorset ( /\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rs\u026at/ ; archaically : Dorsetshire ) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast . The ceremonial county comprises the unitary authority areas of Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole and Dorset . Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating",
  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified .

The Vorontsov Palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea , and is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Crimea 's southern coast . The palace was built between 1828 and 1848 for Russian Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov for use as his personal summer residence at a cost of 9 million silver rubles . It was designed in a loose interpretation of the English Renaissance revival style by English architect Edward Blore and his assistant William Hunt . The building is a hybrid of several architectural styles , but faithful to none . Among those styles are elements of Scottish Baronial , Indo-Saracenic Revival Architecture , and Gothic Revival architecture . Blore had designed many buildings in the United Kingdom , and was later particularly well known there for completing the design of Buckingham Palace in London . Once completed , the palace was visited by many members of the Russian Empire 's elite ruling class ; a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were so taken with the palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in the Crimea . By the early 20th century not only many aristocrats , but also members of the Imperial Family , including the Tsar himself , had palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in the vicinity . An important feature of the Vorontsov Palace is the adjoining park ensemble , which features 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) of greenery and forestry arranged by German landscape gardener Carolus Keebach . Today , the Vorontsov Palace is a part of the Alupka Palace-Park Complex , a national historical preserve including the Massandra Palace in neighbouring Massandra . Owing to its status as an important local tourist attraction and architectural monument , the Vorontsov Palace and its surrounding park complex were frequently featured in Ukrainian and Soviet cinema productions such as : An Ordinary Miracle ( 1964 ) , Nebesnye lastochki ( 1976 ) , Crazy Day or The Marriage of Figaro ( 2004 ) , and Sappho ( 2008 )",

Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the Crimean Khanate during the 15th to 18th century . In 1783 , Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire as the result of the Russo-Turkish War ( 1768-1774 ) . Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the USSR . During World War II , Crimea was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast after its entire indigenous population , the Crimean Tatars , were deported to Central Asia , an act recognized as a genocide . In 1954 , it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR from the Russian SFSR .

After both the Duke and his father died in 1820 , she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller , John Conroy . She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father 's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue . The United Kingdom was an established constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , she attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality . Victoria married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840 . Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent , earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances",

  "/wiki/Vale_Royal_Abbey": "Vale Royal Abbey is a former medieval abbey and later country house in Whitegate England . The precise location and boundaries of the abbey are difficult to determine in today 's landscape . The original building was founded c. 1270 by the Lord Edward , later Edward I for Cistercian monks . Edward had supposedly taken a vow during a rough sea crossing in the 1260s . Civil wars and political upheaval delayed the build until 1272 , the year he inherited the throne . The original site at Darnhall was unsatisfactory , so was moved a few miles north to the Delamere Forest . Edward intended the structure to be on a grand scale - had it been completed it would have been the largest Cistercian monastery in the country - but his ambitions were frustrated by recurring financial difficulties . Early during construction , England became involved in war with Wales . As the treasury was thus in need of resources , Vale Royal lost all of its grants , skilled masons and builders . When work resumed in the late 14th century , the building was considerably smaller than originally planned . The project encountered other problems . The abbey was mismanaged and poor relations with the local population sparked outbreaks of violence on a number of occasions",

Along with St James ' Palace , it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the King owned . The palace is currently in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II and the Crown . In the following century , King William III 's massive rebuilding and expansion work , which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles , destroyed much of the Tudor palace . His work ceased in 1694 , leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles , domestic Tudor and Baroque . While the palace 's styles are an accident of fate , a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical , if vague , balancing of successive low wings .
