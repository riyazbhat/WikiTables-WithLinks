The director of research is Ibrahima Seck , a Senegalese scholar who has done much work on the history of slavery . The grounds contain imaginative exhibits and original art commissioned by Cummings , such as life-size sculptures of children . The sculptures are representative of people born into slavery before the Civil War , many of whom were interviewed as adults for the Federal Writers Project during the Great Depression . These oral histories of hundreds of the last survivors of slavery were collected and published by the federal government , to preserve their stories . The transcripts and some audio recordings are held by the Library of Congress . The French Creole raised-style main house , built in 1803 , is the most important architectural example in the state . In addition , the plantation has numerous extant outbuildings or dependencies : a pigeonnier , a plantation store , the only surviving French Creole barn in Louisiana , and slave quarters ( these were moved from another plantation but are typical of the quarters originally on Whitney )",
