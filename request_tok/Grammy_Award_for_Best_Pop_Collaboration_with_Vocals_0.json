  "/wiki/Something_(Beatles_song)": "Something is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 album Abbey Road . It was written by George Harrison , the band 's lead guitarist , and is widely viewed by music historians as having marked his ascendancy as a composer to the level of the Beatles ' principal songwriters , John Lennon and Paul McCartney . Two weeks after the album 's release , the song was issued on a double A-side single , coupled with Come Together , making it the first Harrison composition to become a Beatles A-side . The pairing was also the first time in the United Kingdom that the Beatles issued a single containing tracks already available on an album . While the single 's commercial performance was lessened by this , it topped the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States as well as charts in Australia , Canada , New Zealand and West Germany , and peaked at number 4 in the UK . Something is described as a love song to Pattie Boyd , Harrison 's first wife , although Harrison offered alternative sources of inspiration in later interviews . Due to the difficulty he faced in getting more than two of his compositions onto each Beatles album , Harrison first offered the song to Joe Cocker . As recorded by the Beatles , the track features a guitar solo that several music critics identify among Harrison 's finest playing . The song also drew praise from the other Beatles and their producer , George Martin , with Lennon stating that it was the best song on Abbey Road . The promotional film for the single combined footage of each of the Beatles with his respective wife , reflecting the estrangement in the band during the months preceding their break-up in April 1970 . Harrison subsequently performed the song at his Concert for Bangladesh shows in 1971 and throughout the two tours he made as a solo artist . Something received the Ivor Novello Award for the Best Song Musically and Lyrically of 1969",

He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each episode of his eponymous television show and named his production company and venue in Branson , Missouri , after it ; his autobiography is called Moon River and Me . Williams ' version was never released as a single , but it charted as an LP track that he recorded for Columbia on a hit album of 1962 , Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes . The song 's success was responsible for relaunching Mercer 's career as a songwriter , which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll had replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time . The song 's popularity is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people 's memories of popular songs . Comments about the lyrics have noted that they are particularly reminiscent of Mercer 's youth in the Southern United States and his longing to expand his horizons . Robert Wright wrote in The Atlantic Monthly , This is a love sung [ sic ] to wanderlust . Or a romantic song in which the romantic partner is the idea of romance",
