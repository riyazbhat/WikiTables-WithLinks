  "/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion .",
  "/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.": "Martin Luther King Jr. ( January 15 , 1929 - April 4 , 1968 ) was an American Christian minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968 . King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience , inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi . King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) . As president of the SCLC , he then led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany , Georgia , and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham , Alabama . He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington , where he delivered his famous I Have a Dream speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . On October 14 , 1964 , King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance . In 1965 , he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches . In his final years , he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War . FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI 's COINTELPRO from 1963 on . FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties , recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials , and , in 1964 , mailed King a threatening anonymous letter , which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide . Before his death , King was planning a national occupation of Washington , D.C. , to be called the Poor People 's Campaign , when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis , Tennessee . His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities .",

  "/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution": "The First Amendment ( Amendment I ) to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which regulate an establishment of religion , prohibit the free exercise of religion , or abridge the freedom of speech , the freedom of the press , the right to peaceably assemble , or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances . It was adopted on December 15 , 1791 , as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights . The Bill of Rights was originally proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification . Initially , the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress , and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today . Beginning with Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states - a process known as incorporation - through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence to call for a wall of separation between church and State , though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute . Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech , anonymous speech , campaign financing , pornography , and school speech ; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections . The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits , most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) . Commercial speech , however , is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech , and is therefore subject to greater regulation . The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions , and applies to a wide variety of media . In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) and New York Times v. United States ( 1971 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint - pre-publication censorship - in almost all cases . The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Times_v._Sullivan": "New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the freedom of speech protections in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution restrict the ability of American public officials to sue for defamation . Specifically , it held that if a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit is a public official or person running for public office , not only must he or she prove the normal elements of defamation - publication of a false defamatory statement to a third party - he or she must also prove that the statement was made with actual malice , meaning that the defendant either knew the statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether or not it was true . The case began in 1960 when The New York Times published a full-page advertisement by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. that criticized the police in Montgomery , Alabama , for their mistreatment of civil rights protesters . However , the ad had several factual inaccuracies , such as the number of times King had been arrested during the protests , what song the protesters had sung , and whether or not students had been expelled for participating . In response , Montgomery police commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the Times in the local county court for defamation . The judge ruled the advertisement 's inaccuracies were defamatory per se , and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Sullivan and awarded him $ 500,000 in damages . The Times appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court of Alabama , which affirmed it . It then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case and ordered certiorari . In March 1964 , the Court issued a unanimous 9-0 decision holding that the Alabama court 's verdict violated the First Amendment . The decision defended free reporting of the civil rights campaigns in the southern United States . It is one of the key decisions supporting the freedom of the press . Before this decision , there were nearly $ 300 million in libel actions from the southern states outstanding against news organizations , as part of a focused effort by southern officials to use defamation lawsuits as a means of preventing critical coverage of civil rights issues in out-of-state publications .",

It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks .
