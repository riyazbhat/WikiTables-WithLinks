The dynasty was founded by the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing Banners , military-social units that included Manchu , Han , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci united Manchu clans and officially proclaimed the Later Jin dynasty in 1616 . His son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of the Liaodong Peninsula and declared a new dynasty , the Qing , in 1636 .

  "/wiki/Kwan_Ti": "Guan Yu ( [ kwa\u0301n y\u0300 ] ( listen ) ; died January or February 220 ) , [ a ] courtesy name Yunchang , was a general serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China . Along with Zhang Fei , he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits . Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei 's state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period . While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei , he is also known for repaying Cao Cao 's kindness by slaying Yan Liang , a general under Cao Cao 's rival Yuan Shao , at the Battle of Boma . After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214 , Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years . In 219 , while he was away fighting Cao Cao 's forces at the Battle of Fancheng , Liu Bei 's ally Sun Quan broke the Sun-Liu alliance and sent his general L\u00fc Meng to conquer Liu Bei 's territories in Jing Province . By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng , it was too late . He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan 's forces and executed . Guan Yu 's life was lionised and his achievements glorified to such an extent after his death that he was deified during the Sui dynasty . Through generations of story telling , culminating in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , his deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis , making Guan Yu one of East Asia 's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness . He is still worshipped by many Chinese people today in mainland China , Taiwan , Tibet , Hong Kong and among many overseas Chinese communities .

The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese . Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ) , numerous rump regimes loyal to the Ming throne - collectively called the Southern Ming - survived until 1662 . [ d ] The Hongwu Emperor ( r. 1368-1398 ) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the Jingnan Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats . One , Zheng He , led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa . The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances ; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely . The imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the Liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the Great Wall of China into its modern form . Wide-ranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially , but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at Nanjing hampered accurate figures .",
