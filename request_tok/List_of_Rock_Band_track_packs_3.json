  "/wiki/The_Gambler_(song)": "The Gambler is a song written by Don Schlitz , recorded by several artists , most famously by American country music singer Kenny Rogers . Don Schlitz wrote this song in August , 1976 when he was 23 years old . It took two years of shopping the song around Nashville before Bobby Bare recorded it on his album Bare at the urging of Shel Silverstein . Bare 's version did not catch on and was never released as a single , so Schlitz recorded it himself , but this version failed to chart higher than No . 65 . However , other musicians took notice and recorded the song in 1978 , including Johnny Cash , who put it on his album Gone Girl . However , it was Kenny Rogers who made the song a mainstream success . His version was a No . 1 Country hit and made its way to the Pop charts at a time when Country songs rarely crossed over . It was released in November 1978 as the title track from his album The Gambler which won him the Grammy award for best male country vocal performance in 1980 . In 2006 Don Schlitz appeared in the Kenny Rogers career retrospective documentary The Journey , where he praised both Rogers ' and Butler 's contributions to the song stating they added several ideas that were not mine , including the new guitar intro . It was one of five consecutive songs by Rogers to hit No",
  "/wiki/Kenny_Rogers": "Kenneth Ray Rogers ( born August 21 , 1938 ) is an American retired singer , songwriter , actor , record producer , and entrepreneur . He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame . In the late 1950s , he started his recording career with jazz-singer Bobby Doyle , and joined the folk ensemble The New Christy Minstrels in 1961 , playing double bass and bass guitar as well as singing . In 1967 , he and several members of The New Christy Minstrels left to found the group The First Edition , with whom he scored his first major hit , Just Dropped In ( To See What Condition My Condition Was In ) , a psychedelic rock song which peaked at number five on the Billboard charts . As Rogers took an increased leadership role in The First Edition , and following the success of 1969 's Ruby , Do n't Take Your Love to Town , the band gradually changed styles to a more country feel . The band broke up in 1975-1976 , and Kenny Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career , which included several successful collaborations , including duets with singers Dolly Parton and Sheena Easton , and a songwriting partnership with Lionel Richie . His signature song is 1978 's The Gambler , a cross-over hit that won him a Grammy award in 1980 and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress . He would develop the Gambler persona into a character for a successful series of television films starting with 1980 's Emmy-nominated Kenny Rogers as The Gambler . Though he has been most successful with country audiences , Rogers has charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres , topped the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone , and has sold over 100 million records worldwide , making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time . On September 25 , 2015 , Rogers announced on NBC 's Today Show that he was retiring from show business after a final tour to spend more time with his wife and twin sons . Two of his albums , The Gambler and Kenny , are featured in the About.com poll of The 200 Most Influential Country Albums Ever . He was voted the Favorite Singer of All Time in a 1986 joint poll by readers of both USA Today and People"
