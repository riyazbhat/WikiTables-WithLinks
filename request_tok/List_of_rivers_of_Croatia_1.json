  "/wiki/Adriatic_Sea": "The Adriatic Sea /\u02cce\u026adri\u02c8\u00e6t\u026ak/ is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula . The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea , extending from the Strait of Otranto ( where it connects to the Ionian Sea ) to the northwest and the Po Valley . The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate . The Adriatic Sea sits on the Apulian or Adriatic Microplate , which separated from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era . The plate 's movement contributed to the formation of the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate",

Korana rises in the eastern parts of Lika , creates the world-famous Plitvice Lakes , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Downstream from Plitvice Lakes the Korana river forms a 25 kilometers long border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina near Cazin . From there it flows northwards through Croatia , where it finally reaches the river Kupa at Karlovac . The soil of the karst region , through which this river flows consists of limestone . Under certain physical and chemical conditions the river is constantly creating new soil from plants ( see : Plitvice Lakes ) . The river Slunj\u010dica flows into Korana at Rastoke/Slunj , and the river Mre\u017enica flows into it at Karlovac",
  "/wiki/Gacka": "Gacka is a river located in the Lika region in central Croatia . Because for a large part of its course it is a subterranean river , estimates on its length vary . The overground part has undergone substantial human intervention - before it was 32 kilometres ( 20 miles ) long ; now it is only 11 kilometres ( 6.8 miles ) long . It has been regulated by man to flow into an aqueduct in Gusi\u0107 polje ( known as Tunel Gacka-Gusi\u0107 Jezero ) and then into the Adriatic Sea through a hydroelectric installation HE Senj near Sveti Juraj . HE Senj takes inflow from Gacka and Lika , since it was built in 1965 .

  "/wiki/Jadro": "The Jadro is a watercourse in Dalmatia , Croatia that discharges to the Adriatic Sea . The upper reaches of the Jadro River , as well as its source , Jadro Spring , are protected as an ichthyological nature reserve , partly due to the presence of an endemic species of soft-mouthed trout . The headwaters of the Jadro River were the original water supply for the ancient city comprised by Diocletian 's Palace ( now an area within the present day city of Split ) . Contemporary studies indicate favourable water quality levels of the river near the headwaters at Jadro Spring . The Jadro flows through the town of Solin and has a length of approximately four kilometres ' moreover , the river provides water to the cities of Split , Ka\u0161tela and Trogir . People from Solin also call it Solinska rika . Salmo obtusirostris salonitana is an endemic trout species living in this river , which is currently endangered by the rainbow trout",
  "/wiki/Ombla": "The Ombla is a short river in Croatia , northeast of Dubrovnik . Its course is approximately 30 metres ( 98 feet ) long , and it empties into the Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka embayment of the Adriatic Sea near Komolac in Dubrovnik-Neretva County . Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka is actually a ria , a flooded river valley formed through changes in sea surface elevation on a geologic time scale . The river rises as a karst spring fed by groundwater replenished by Trebi\u0161njica , which is an influent stream flowing in Popovo Polje , in the immediate hinterland of the Ombla . The elevation difference between the river 's source and its mouth is just over 2 metres ( 6 feet 7 inches ) . The average discharge of the river is 24.1 cubic metres ( 850 cubic feet ) per second . The drainage basin of the Ombla encompasses 600 square kilometres ( 230 square miles ) and , besides the short surface course , includes only groundwater flow . The Ombla is used as a source of drinking water for Dubrovnik 's water supply network , and construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been planned for the past two decades . As of 2012 [ update ] , the plans entail construction of a subsurface reservoir and a 68 megawatt power plant . The plan sparked controversy amid doubts raised with respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management , technical and financial feasibility , and procedural problems related to the project . A particular concern expressed was that the underground reservoir might trigger earthquakes"
