  "/wiki/Reporting_mark": "A reporting mark is an alphabetic code of two to four letters used to identify owners or lessees of rolling stock and other equipment used on certain railroad networks . In North America the mark , which consists of an alphabetic code of one to four letters , is stenciled on each piece of equipment , along with a one- to six-digit number . This information is used to uniquely identify every such rail car or locomotive , thus allowing it to be tracked by the railroad they are traveling over , which shares the information with other railroads and customers .",
  "/wiki/BC_Rail": "BC Rail ( reporting mark BCOL , BCIT ) , is a railway in the Canadian province of British Columbia . Chartered as a private company in 1912 as the Pacific Great Eastern Railway ( PGE ) , it was acquired by the provincial government in 1918 . In 1972 it was renamed to the British Columbia Railway , and in 1984 it took on its present name of BC Rail . Until 2004 it operated as the third largest railway in Canada , providing freight , passenger , and excursion rail services throughout BC on 2,320 km ( 1,440 mi ) of mainline track . It was designated a Class II Railway until 2004 , and remains a crown corporation today . It also ran the Royal Hudson services , as well as the Premier 's private train . In 2004 , the operations ( including a vast amount of land , buildings , and all rolling stock ) were leased to Canadian National Railway ( CN ) for an initial period of 60 Years for the price of $ 550 Million . CN holds the sole right to renew the lease for up to 999 years through a series of options . The Lease also allows for BC Rail to give CN title to any and all of the railway for the nominal price of $ 1 . The lease was made despite the promise of Premier Gordon Campbell to not sell the railway in the preceding election , and was the subject of the biggest political scandal in BC History resulting in the British Columbia Legislature Raids . The BC Liberal Government had been accused of fabricated falsehoods about the state of its debts and viability in order to justify the deal with CN , claiming the railway was in disarray . Canadian Pacific , a rival bidder , privately stated in since-released communications that the bid was rigged .",
