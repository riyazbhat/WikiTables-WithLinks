  "/wiki/Viral_envelope": "Some viruses ( e.g . HIV and many animal viruses ) have viral envelopes as their outer layer at the stage of their life-cycle when they are between host cells . Some enveloped viruses also have a protein layer called a capsid between the envelope and their genome . The envelopes are typically derived from portions of the host cell membranes ( phospholipids and proteins ) , but include some viral glycoproteins . They may help viruses avoid the host immune system . Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host 's membrane . The viral envelope then fuses with the host 's membrane , allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host . The cell from which the virus itself buds will often die or be weakened and shed more viral particles for an extended period . The lipid bilayer envelope of these viruses is relatively sensitive to desiccation , heat , and detergents , therefore these viruses are easier to sterilize than non-enveloped viruses , have limited survival outside host environments , and typically must transfer directly from host to host . Enveloped viruses possess great adaptability and can change in a short time in order to evade the immune system . Enveloped viruses can cause persistent infections .",

  "/wiki/Herpesviridae": "Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause infections and certain diseases in animals , including humans . The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses . The family name is derived from the Greek word herpein ( to creep ) , referring to spreading cutaneous lesions , usually involving blisters , seen in flares of herpes simplex 1 , herpes simplex 2 and herpes zoster ( shingles ) . In 1971 , the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) established Herpesvirus as a genus with 23 viruses among four groups . Latent , recurring infections are typical of this group of viruses , though the family name does not refer to latency . Herpesviridae can cause latent or lytic infections . At least five species of the Herpesviridae - HSV-1 and HSV-2 ( both of which can cause orolabial herpes and genital herpes ) , varicella zoster virus ( the cause of chickenpox and shingles ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( implicated in several diseases , including mononucleosis and some cancers ) , and cytomegalovirus - are extremely widespread among humans . More than 90% of adults have been infected with at least one of these , and a latent form of the virus remains in almost all humans who have been infected . Nine herpesvirus types are known to infect humans : herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 ( HSV-1 and HSV-2 , also known as HHV1 and HHV2 ) , varicella-zoster virus ( VZV , which may also be called by its ICTV name , HHV-3 ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV or HHV-4 ) , human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV or HHV-5 ) , human herpesvirus 6A and 6B ( HHV-6A and HHV-6B ) , human herpesvirus 7 ( HHV-7 ) , and Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV , also known as HHV-8 ) .

It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis ( mono or glandular fever ) . It is also associated with various non-malignant , premalignant , and malignant Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma , hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , and Hodgkin 's lymphoma ; non-lymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma ; and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas . The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and , based on some evidence , higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases , especially dermatomyositis , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome , and multiple sclerosis . About 200,000 cancer cases per year are thought to be attributable to EBV . Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions . Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity . In the United States , about half of all five-year-old children and about 90% of adults have evidence of previous infection . Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears . Many children become infected with EBV , and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild , brief illnesses of childhood . In the United States and other developed countries , many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years . When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence , it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50% of the time .",

It is also commonly called CMV . Within Herpesviridae , HCMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily , which also includes cytomegaloviruses from other mammals . Although they may be found throughout the body , HCMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands . HCMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people , but can be life-threatening for the immunocompromised , such as HIV-infected persons , organ transplant recipients , or newborn infants . Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can lead to significant morbidity and even death . After infection , HCMV remains latent within the body throughout life and can be reactivated at any time . Eventually , it may cause mucoepidermoid carcinoma and possibly other malignancies such as prostate cancer . HCMV is found in all geographic locations and all socioeconomic groups , and infects between 60% and 70% of adults in developed countries and almost 100% in developing countries . Of all herpes viruses , HCMV harbors the most genes dedicated to altering ( evading ) innate and adaptive host immunity and represents a lifelong burden of antigenic T cell surveillance and immune dysfunction . Commonly it is indicated by the presence of antibodies in the general population . Seroprevalence is age-dependent : 58.9% of individuals aged 6 and older are infected with CMV while 90.8% of individuals aged 80 and older are positive for HCMV .",

  "/wiki/Papillomaviridae": "Papillomaviridae is an ancient taxonomic family of non-enveloped DNA viruses , collectively known as papillomaviruses . Several hundred species of papillomaviruses , traditionally referred to as types , have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals , but also other vertebrates such as birds , snakes , turtles and fish . Infection by most papillomavirus types , depending on the type , is either asymptomatic ( e.g . most Beta-PVs ) or causes small benign tumors , known as papillomas or warts ( e.g . human papillomavirus 1 , HPV6 or HPV11 ) . Papillomas caused by some types , however , such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18 , carry a risk of becoming cancerous . Papillomaviruses are usually considered as highly host- and tissue-tropic , and are thought to rarely be transmitted between species . Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues . All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface , typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals , anus , mouth , or airways . For example , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet , and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands , where they may cause warts . Additionally , there are descriptions of the presence of papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Papillomaviruses were first identified in the early 20th century , when it was shown that skin warts , or papillomas , could be transmitted between individuals by a filterable infectious agent .",

About 90% of HPV infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously within two years . However , in some cases , an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions . These lesions , depending on the site affected , increase the risk of cancer of the cervix , vulva , vagina , penis , anus , mouth , or throat . Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV ; two types , HPV16 and HPV18 , account for 70% of cases . Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV . HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis . An HPV infection is caused by human papillomavirus , a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family . Over 170 types have been described . More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals . Risk factors for persistent infection by sexually transmitted types include early age of first sexual intercourse , multiple sexual partners , smoking , and poor immune function . These types are typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact , with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods .",

In about 15% of people , within a day of improving the fever comes back , abdominal pain occurs , and liver damage begins causing yellow skin . If this occurs , the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased . The disease is caused by yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito . It infects only humans , other primates , and several types of mosquitoes . In cities , it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti , a type of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics . The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus . The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses , especially in the early stages . To confirm a suspected case , blood-sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required . A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists , and some countries require vaccinations for travelers .",
  "/wiki/Dengue_fever": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus . Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection . These may include a high fever , headache , vomiting , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash . Recovery generally takes two to seven days . In a small proportion of cases , the disease develops into severe dengue , also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs . Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes type , principally A. aegypti . The virus has five types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term immunity to the others . Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications . A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA . A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries . The vaccine , however , is only recommended in those who have been previously infected . [ needs update ] Other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites .",

  "/wiki/Retroviridae": "A retrovirus is a type of RNA virus that inserts a copy of its genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades , thus changing the genome of that cell . Once inside the host cell 's cytoplasm , the virus uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome , the reverse of the usual pattern , thus retro ( backwards ) . The new DNA is then incorporated into the host cell genome by an integrase enzyme , at which point the retroviral DNA is referred to as a provirus . The host cell then treats the viral DNA as part of its own genome , transcribing and translating the viral genes along with the cell 's own genes , producing the proteins required to assemble new copies of the virus . It is difficult to detect the virus until it has infected the host . At that point , the infection will persist indefinitely . In most viruses , DNA is transcribed into RNA , and then RNA is translated into protein . However , retroviruses function differently , as their RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA , which is integrated into the host cell 's genome ( when it becomes a provirus ) , and then undergoes the usual transcription and translational processes to express the genes carried by the virus . The information contained in a retroviral gene is thus used to generate the corresponding protein via the sequence : RNA \u2192 DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 polypeptide . This extends the fundamental process identified by Francis Crick ( one gene-one peptide ) in which the sequence is DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 peptide ( proteins are made of one or more polypeptide chains ; for example , haemoglobin is a four-chain peptide ) .

  "/wiki/Human_immunodeficiency_virus": "The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV ) are two species of Lentivirus ( a subgroup of retrovirus ) that infect humans . Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive . Without treatment , average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years , depending on the HIV subtype . In most cases , HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood , pre-ejaculate , semen , and vaginal fluids . Research has shown ( for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples ) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load . Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy , during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid , and through breast milk . Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells . HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system , such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4+ T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells . HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms , including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells , apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells . When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections , leading to the development of AIDS .",

Single stranded RNA viruses are classified as positive or negative depending on the sense or polarity of the RNA . The negative viral RNA is complementary to the mRNA and must be converted to a positive RNA by RNA polymerase before translation . Therefore , the purified RNA of a negative sense virus is not infectious by itself , as it needs to be converted to a positive sense RNA for replication . These viruses belong to Group V on the Baltimore classification . In addition , negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses have complex genomic sequences , cell cycles , and replication habits that use various protein complexes to arrange in specific conformations and carry out necessary processes for survival and reproduction of their genomic sequences .

Ellioviricetes is named in honor of late virologist Richard M. Elliott for his early work on bunyaviruses . In 2017 , the ICTV reclassified the family Bunyaviridae as Bunyavirales , a taxonomic shift from a family of viruses to an order of viruses . The body made these decisions in a 2016 convening in Budapest . Primary reasons for this alteration revolve around these observations : approximately half of viruses in the former Bunyaviridae were at the time unassigned to a genus ; novel viruses discovered that were characteristic of and clustered around Bunyaviridae based on phylogenetic analyses had bi-segmented genomes ( as opposed to Bunyaviridae 's tri-segmentation ) ; and plant viruses also lacking tri-segmentation were previously known to be bunya-like yet were not properly assigned to the family Bunyaviridae based upon the past taxonomic classifications . All five genera formerly in the family Bunyaviridae ( Hantavirus , Nairovirus , Orthobunyavirus , Phlebovirus , Tospovirus ) are now novel viral families , some of which have been combined .

Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD and is the cause of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa , which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths . Ebola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of Congo ) , the country where it was first described , and was at first suspected to be a new strain of the closely related Marburg virus . The virus was renamed Ebola virus in 2010 to avoid confusion . Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus , which is the type species for the genus Ebolavirus , family Filoviridae , order Mononegavirales .

It is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood . A prophylactic medication , palivizumab , can be employed to prevent HRSV in preterm ( under 35 weeks gestation ) infants , infants with certain congenital heart defects ( CHD ) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , and infants with congenital malformations of the airway . Treatment is limited to supportive care , including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with CPAP or nasal high flow oxygen , as required . In temperate climates there is an annual epidemic during the winter months . In tropical climates , infection is most common during the rainy season . In the United States , 60% of infants are infected during their first HRSV season , and nearly all children will have been infected with the virus by 2-3 years of age . Of those infected with RSV , 2-3% will develop bronchiolitis , necessitating hospitalization . Natural infection with HRSV induces protective immunity which wanes over time - possibly more so than other respiratory viral infections - and thus people can be infected multiple times . Sometimes an infant can become symptomatically infected more than once , even within a single HRSV season . Severe HRSV infections have increasingly been found among elderly patients . Young adults can be re-infected every five to seven years , with symptoms looking like a sinus infection or a cold ( infections can also be asymptomatic ) ."
