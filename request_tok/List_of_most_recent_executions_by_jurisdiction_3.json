  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed",
  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension",

It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834",
  "/wiki/David_Mitchell_(murderer)": "David Mitchell ( 1972 - 6 January 2000 ) was a murderer who killed two German tourists in the Bahamas and was executed as a result . His is the most recent execution to be performed by the Bahamas . Mitchell was convicted of stabbing his victims to death and received the mandatory sentence of death by hanging . He was originally scheduled to be executed on 10 August 1999 , but execution was delayed to allow the Bahamian appeal courts to hear his appeal on the constitutionality of the death penalty . His appeal was rejected by the Bahamian courts and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London , which acts as the final court of appeal for the Bahamas . Mitchell was hanged in the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau on the morning of 6 January 2000 . His execution was controversial because it was carried out while he had an appeal pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights . Amnesty International alleged that this amounted to a violation of the Bahamas ' treaty obligations as a member of the Organization of American States . The victims ' son had also requested that the death sentence be commuted . John Higgs was scheduled to be executed the same day as Mitchell for an unrelated murder , but he committed suicide the day before",

  "/wiki/Firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations .

Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes",

The British dependency of Anguilla was historically also a part of this union , which was then known collectively as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla . However , it chose to secede from the union and remains a British overseas territory . To the north-northwest lie the islands of Sint Eustatius , Saba , Saint Barth\u00e9lemy , Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Anguilla . To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda , and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda ( part of Antigua and Barbuda ) and the island of Montserrat .

Human rights activists and opposition politicians also pointed out that Laplace was not represented by legal counsel at the time of his execution"
