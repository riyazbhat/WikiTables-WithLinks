  "/wiki/Badminton": "Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net . Although it may be played with larger teams , the most common forms of the game are singles ( with one player per side ) and doubles ( with two players per side ) . Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach ; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court . Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side 's half of the court . Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net . Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire , service judge , or ( in their absence ) the opposing side . The shuttlecock is a feathered or ( in informal matches ) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports . In particular , the feathers create much higher drag , causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly . Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports . The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature . The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock . European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia , with recent competitions dominated by China .",

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

  "/wiki/Shooting_sports": "Shooting sports is a collective group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy , precision and speed in shooting - the art of using various types of ranged weapons , mainly referring to human-portable guns ( firearms and airguns , in forms such as handguns , rifles and shotguns ) and bows/crossbows . Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment , shooting distances , targets , time limits and degrees of athleticism involved . Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition , and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members . Due to the noise of shooting and the high ( and often lethal ) impact energy of the projectiles , shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",
