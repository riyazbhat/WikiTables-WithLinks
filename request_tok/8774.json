The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts - such as songwriter - but as a standalone writer normally refers to the creation of written language . Some writers work from an oral tradition . Writers can produce material across a number of genres , fictional or non-fictional . Other writers use multiple media - for example , graphics or illustration - to enhance the communication of their ideas . Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers , whose skills create understandable , interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature . Some writers may use images ( drawing , painting , graphics ) or multimedia to augment their writing . In rare instances , creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words . As well as producing their own written works , writers often write on how they write ( that is , the process they use ) ; why they write ( that is , their motivation ) ; and also comment on the work of other writers ( criticism ) .",

As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",
