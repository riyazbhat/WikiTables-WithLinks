  "/wiki/U.S._Route_61": "U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 ( US 61 ) is a major United States highway which extends 1,400 miles ( 2,300 km ) between New Orleans , Louisiana and the city of Wyoming , Minnesota . The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River , and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route . As of 2004 , the highway 's northern terminus in Wyoming , Minnesota , is at an intersection with Interstate 35 ( I-35 ) . Until 1991 , the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 ( MN 61 ) through Duluth and across the Canada-U.S. border , near Grand Portage . Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 ( US 90 ) . The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul , Minnesota ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Memphis , Tennessee ; the Mississippi Delta , and New Orleans . The route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system . Many southerners traveled north along US 61 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul . The highway has a long musical history , being the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes . The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan 's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name , which imagines all sorts of fantastical events ( including World War III ) occurring alongside it . Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim ; one in 1962 by Johnny Young ; and a 1981 song , 61 Highway , by bluesman James Son Thomas . To denote US 61 's significance in blues music history , there are two markers on the route which are part of the Mississippi Blues Trail : 61 Highway in Vicksburg , Mississippi and Highway 61 Blues in Tunica , Mississippi .",

It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages ( suburbs ) linked together by loose trading networks . The largest city was Cahokia , believed to be a major religious center . The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley ( for which it is named ) . Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point .

  "/wiki/Bridge_No._12": "Bridge No . 12 is a Warren pony truss bridge in Hay Creek Township , Minnesota . The bridge is 63 feet ( 19 m ) long and 16 feet ( 4.9 m ) wide and carries Township Road 43 over Bullard Creek . It is built of angle sections riveted together , as recommended in the engineering textbook The Design of Highway Bridges published in 1908 . During this time , the state government was attempting to standardize design and construction of bridges by financial incentives , rather than proposing legislation . The county commissioners of Goodhue County decided in late 1907 to build a bridge over Bullard Creek , but they were dissatisfied with the first round of bids . In the spring of 1908 , Louis P. Wolff proposed a bridge that would comply with Minnesota Highway Commission rules and regulations . By building a bridge that complied with the rules , the state would subsidize the cost of the bridge through road and bridge appropriations . The county commissioners approved of these ideas and paid Wolff $ 100 for the plans and blueprints . William P. Glardon from Red Wing , Minnesota was the contractor , and the Minneapolis Steel & Machinery Company fabricated the steel . The bridge is listed on the Iron and Steel Bridges in Minnesota Multiple Property Submission .",

The connected elements ( typically straight ) may be stressed from tension , compression , or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads . The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers . A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently .",
  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

This compares with a population of 6.6 million on the island of Ireland . In contrast to Ireland , surveys since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of Americans who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry as also self-identifying as being Protestant , and are actually mostly Scotch-Irish , the American descendants of Ulster Protestants ( mostly Ulster Scots ) who emigrated from Ireland to the United States . Three million people separately self-identified as Scotch-Irish , but demographers have long assumed the U.S. Census Bureau self-identification estimate of the Scotch-Irish to be a serious undercount ( in part , because along with English and other British ancestries , many Scotch-Irish self-identify as being of American ancestry ) . While some argue that the Scotch-Irish should be considered Irish , considering that conversions by Irish Catholics during the Reformation in Ireland to Protestant churches were historically rare , and that intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics in both Ireland and in the United States was also historically rare [ list 1 ] while interethnic and interdenominational marriage amongst Protestants in Ulster was relatively common , [ list 2 ] multiple historians have argued instead that the Scotch-Irish distinction remains necessary as the Ulster Protestants remain a distinct ethnoreligious group from the Irish Catholics .

This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak of 8.5 million in the 1840s . The poorest of them went to Great Britain , especially Liverpool ; those who could afford it went farther , including almost 5 million to the United States . After 1765 , emigration from Ireland became a short , relentless , and efficiently managed national enterprise . In 1890 , 40% of Irish-born people were living abroad . By the 21st century , an estimated 80 million people worldwide claimed some Irish descent , which includes more than 36 million Americans who claim Irish as their primary ethnicity . As recently as the second half of the nineteenth century , the majority of Irish emigrants spoke Irish as their first language .

  "/wiki/Protestantism": "Protestantism is the second-largest form of Christianity with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians . [ a ] It originated with the 16th century Reformation , [ b ] a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church . Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments , but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . They emphasize the priesthood of all believers , justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than also by good works , and the highest authority of the Bible alone ( rather than also with sacred tradition ) in faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The five solae summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church . Protestantism began in Germany [ c ] in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church , which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers . However , the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical . Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Roman Catholic Church - notably by Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , and Jan Hus - only Luther succeeded in sparking a wider , lasting , and modern movement . In the 16th century , Lutheranism spread from Germany [ d ] into Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Estonia , and Iceland . Reformed ( or Calvinist ) denominations spread in Germany , [ e ] Hungary , the Netherlands , Scotland , Switzerland and France by reformers such as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism , bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement .

It was built during a time of agricultural growth in Goodhue County , when dairy cow herds were averaging 25 cows per farm and farmers were starting to build specialized barns . The round barn design was built around a silo and provided insulation for the silage , as well as making feeding and cleaning easier . Despite the efficiency , however , round barns were difficult to construct , and they were not widely adopted . Later in its history the barn was used for honey production of the bee keeping owners of the farm . In 2000 the Farm was purchased by Robin and Elaine Kleffman and the Dammon Barn underwent some significant restoration .

Round barn construction in the United States can be divided into two overlapping eras . The first , the octagonal era , spanned from 1850-1900 . The second , the true circular era , spanned from 1889-1936 . The overlap meant that round barns of both types , polygonal and circular , were built during the latter part of the nineteenth century .
