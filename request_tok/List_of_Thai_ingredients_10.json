  "/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription": "The Royal Thai General System of Transcription ( RTGS ) is the official system for rendering Thai words in the Latin alphabet . It was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand . It is used in road signs and government publications and is the closest method to a standard of transcription for Thai , but its use , by even the government , is inconsistent . The system is almost identical to the one that is defined by ISO 11940-2",
  "/wiki/Thai_script": "The Thai script ( Thai : \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e23\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 ; RTGS : akson thai ) is the abugida used to write Thai , Southern Thai and many other languages spoken in Thailand . The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles",

This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds , swamps , streams and rivers , flooded rice paddies or temporary pools which may dry up . When this happens , its walking skill allows the fish to move to other sources of water . Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives",
