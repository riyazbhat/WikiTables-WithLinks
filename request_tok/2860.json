Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

The basin is so named because it is drained by the Powder River , although it is also drained in part by the Cheyenne River , Tongue River , Bighorn River , Little Missouri River , Platte River , and their tributaries . While the Powder River Basin is unified geologically , residents of areas distant from the Powder River proper do not think of themselves as living in a single geographic region . For example , residents of the Crow Reservation in the Big Horn River watershed , or of Sheridan in the Tongue River watershed , would locate the Powder River Basin as the region east of the Big Horn Mountains , using a definition based on watershed and topography . Major cities in the area include Gillette and Sheridan , Wyoming and Miles City , Montana .

As of May 2013 , about 14 trains per day used the route . The Hinckley Subdivision has also recently hosted steam train excursions in 2013 , and planned 2014 , in the form of Milwaukee Road 261 . Passenger trains used this route until 1985 when Amtrak 's North Star service ended . As of 2010 , a proposed train dubbed the Northern Lights Express ( NLX ) is in planning stages . While the previous train was limited to between 50 and 79 miles per hour ( 80 and 127 km/h ) , the Northern Lights Express would run at up to 110 mph ( 180 km/h ) .
