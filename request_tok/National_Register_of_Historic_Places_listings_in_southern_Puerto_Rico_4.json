In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical",

  "/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party": "The Puerto Rico Nationalist Party ( Spanish : Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico , PNPR ) is a Puerto Rican political party which was founded on September 17 , 1922 , in San Juan , Puerto Rico . Its primary goal was to work for Puerto Rico 's independence . The Party 's selection in 1930 of Pedro Albizu Campos as its president brought a radical change to the organization and its tactics . In the 1930s , intimidation , repression and persecution of Party members by the government , then headed by a U.S. president-appointed governor , led to the assassination of two government officials , the attempted assassination of a federal judge in Puerto Rico , and the Rio Piedras and Ponce massacres . Under the leadership of Albizu Campos , the party abandoned the electoral process in favor of direct armed conflict as means to gain independence from the United States . By the late 1940s , a more US-friendly party , the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico , had gained an overwhelming number of seats in the legislature and , in 1948 , it passed Puerto Rico 's Gag Law , which attempted to suppress the Nationalist Party and similar opposition . The Puerto Rican police arrested many Nationalist Party members under this law , some of whom were sentenced to lengthy prison terms . With a new political status pending for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth , Albizu Campos ordered armed uprisings in several Puerto Rican towns to occur on October 30 , 1950 . In an related effort , two Nationalists also attempted to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman on November 1 , 1950 , in an effort to call international attention to issues related to Puerto Rico 's political status , but the attempt failed . The last major armed event by the Nationalists occurred in 1954 at the US House of Representatives when four party members shot and wounded five Congressmen .

The march had been organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873 , and to protest the U.S. government 's imprisonment of the Party 's leader , Pedro Albizu Campos , on sedition charges . An investigation led by the United States Commission on Civil Rights put the blame for the massacre squarely on the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico , Blanton Winship . Further criticism by members of the U.S. Congress led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove Winship in 1939 as governor . Governor Winship was never prosecuted for the massacre and no one under his chain of command - including the police who took part in the event , and admitted to the mass shooting - was ever prosecuted or reprimanded .

  "/wiki/Opera": "Opera is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers , but is distinct from musical theater . Such a work ( the literal translation of Italian word opera ) is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs , opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater , Singspiel and Op\u00e9ra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style , and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his reform operas in the 1760s . The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) , and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , landmarks in the German tradition .

  "/wiki/Classical_Revival_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical",
  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces",
