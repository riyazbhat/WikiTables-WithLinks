Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

Cretan Muslims were of mainly Greek origin , with in certain cases some Turkish ancestry through intermarriage with the small number of Turks who settled on Ottoman Crete . Many Cretan Greeks had converted to Islam in the wake of the Ottoman conquest of Crete . This high rate of local conversions to Islam was similar to that in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Albania , parts of western Greek Macedonia , and Bulgaria ; perhaps even a uniquely high rate of conversions rather than immigrants . The Greek Muslims of Crete continued to speak Cretan Greek . They were often called Turkocretans ; among the Christian population , intermarriage and conversion to Islam produced a group of people called Turkocretans ; ethnically Greek but converted ( or feigning conversion ) to Islam for various practical reasons . European travellers ' accounts note that the 'Turks ' of Crete were mostly not of Turkic origin , but were Cretan converts from Orthodoxy . Sectarian violence during the 19th century caused many to leave Crete , especially during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 , and after autonomous Crete 's unilateral declaration of union with Greece rule in 1908 . Finally , after the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 and the Turkish War of Independence , the remaining Muslims of Crete were compulsorily exchanged for the Greek Christians of Anatolia under the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne ( 1923 ) . At all periods , most Cretan Muslims were Greek-speaking , but the language of administration and the prestige language for the Muslim urban upper classes was Ottoman Turkish . In the folk tradition , however , Greek was used to express Muslims ' Islamic -- often Bektashi -- sensibility . Under the Ottoman Empire , many Cretan Turks attained prominent positions .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

It is considered to be among the most modernized Arab cities and a major tourist destination . The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal , where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered . During the Iron Age , the city was known as Ammon , home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites . It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods , and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period . Abandoned for much of the medieval and post-medieval period , modern Amman dates to the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in 1867 . The first municipal council was established in 1909 . Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan 's capital in 1921 , and after several successive waves of refugees : Palestinians in 1948 and 1967 ; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003 ; and Syrians since 2011 .

During Ottoman rule in Libya ( 1551-1912 ) , Turkish settlers began to migrate to the region predominately from Anatolia , but also from other parts of the empire - such as the island of Crete . A significant number of Turks intermarried with the native population , and the male offspring of these marriages were referred to as Kouloughlis ( Turkish : kulo\u011flu ) due to their mixed heritage . However , in general , intermarriage was discouraged , in order to preserve the Turkishness of the community . Consequently , the terms Turks and Kouloughlis have traditionally been used to distinguish between those of full and partial Turkish ancestry . The Turkish community has traditionally dominated the political life of Libya . After the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire , Turks continued to migrate to Libya from the newly established modern states , particuarly from the Republic of Turkey , but also from other regions with significant Turkish settlements such as Cyprus and Egypt . When the Libyan Civil War erupted in 2011 , Misrata became the bastion of resistance and Turco-Libyans figured prominently in the war . In 2014 a former Gaddafi officer reported to the New York Times that the civil war was now an ethnic struggle between Arab tribes ( like the Zintanis ) against those of Turkish ancestry ( like the Misuratis ) , as well as against the Berbers and Circassians .",

Following elections in 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties , its authority had extended only in areas A and B of the West Bank . Since January 2013 , the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority uses the name State of Palestine on official documents . The Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994 , pursuant to the Oslo Accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and the government of Israel , as a five-year interim body . Further negotiations were then meant to take place between the two parties regarding its final status . According to the Oslo Accords , the Palestinian Authority was designated to have exclusive control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas ( referred to as Area A ) and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas ( Area B ) . The remainder of the territories , including Israeli settlements , the Jordan Valley region and bypass roads between Palestinian communities , were to remain under Israeli control ( Area C ) . East Jerusalem was excluded from the Accords . Negotiations with several Israeli governments had resulted in the Authority gaining further control of some areas , but control was then lost in some areas when the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) retook several strategic positions during the Second ( Al-Aqsa ) Intifada . In 2005 , after the Second Intifada , Israel withdrew unilaterally from its settlements in the Gaza Strip , thereby expanding Palestinian Authority control to the entire strip while Israel continued to control the crossing points , airspace , and the waters off the Gaza Strip 's coast . In the Palestinian legislative elections on 25 January 2006 , Hamas emerged victorious and nominated Ismail Haniyeh as the Authority 's Prime Minister . However , the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed , when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted , mainly in the Gaza Strip .",

The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore . The West Bank was the name given to the territory that was captured by Jordan in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War , and subsequently annexed in 1950 until 1967 when it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War . The Oslo Accords , signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel , created administrative districts with varying levels of Palestinian autonomy within each area . Area C , in which Israel maintained complete civil and security control , accounts for over 60 % of the territory of the West Bank . The West Bank , including East Jerusalem , has a land area of 5,640 km2 plus a water area of 220 km2 , consisting of the northwest quarter of the Dead Sea . As of July 2017 [ update ] it has an estimated population of 2,747,943 Palestinians , and approximately 391,000 Israeli settlers , and approximately another 201,200 Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this . The International Court of Justice advisory ruling ( 2004 ) concluded that events that came after the 1967 occupation of the West Bank by Israel , including the Jerusalem Law , Israel 's peace treaty with Jordan and the Oslo Accords , did not change the status of the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) as occupied territory with Israel as the occupying power .",

Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north , Kuwait to the northeast , Qatar , Bahrain , and the United Arab Emirates to the east , Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south ; it is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba . It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast , and most of its terrain consists of arid desert , lowland and mountains . As of October 2018 , the Saudi economy was the largest in the Middle East and the 18th largest in the world . Saudi Arabia also has one of the world 's youngest populations ; 50 percent of its 33.4 million people are under 25 years old . The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations . The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world . The world 's second-largest religion , Islam , emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia . In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe .",

The majority of Syrian Turkmen are the descendants of migrants who arrived in Syria during Ottoman rule ( 1516-1918 ) ; however , there are also many Syrian Turkmen who are the descendants of earlier Turkish settlers that arrived during the Seljuk ( 1037-1194 ) and Mamluk ( 1250-1517 ) rule . Today , the Turkish-speaking Syrian Turkmen make up the third largest ethnic group in the country , after the Arabs and Kurds respectively ; yet , some estimations indicate that if Arabized Turkmen ( i.e . those who no longer speak their mother tongue ) are taken into account then they form the second biggest group in the country .

The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba .
