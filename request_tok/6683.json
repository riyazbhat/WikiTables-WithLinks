  "/wiki/Ion_rapid_transit": "Ion , stylized as ION , is an integrated public transportation network in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada . It is operated by Keolis and is part of the Grand River Transit ( GRT ) system , partially replacing GRT 's Route 200 iXpress bus service . The section of Route 200 serving Cambridge has been renamed Ion Bus . The first phase commenced operations on June 21 , 2019 , between the north end of Waterloo and the south end of Kitchener . A future extension of light rail to the downtown Galt area of Cambridge ( Phase 2 ) is planned but construction may not begin on that line until 2025 . In 2009 , an Environmental Assessment ( EA ) began to create a proposal of electrically-powered light rail transit through Kitchener and Waterloo , and adapted bus rapid transit from Kitchener to Cambridge . On June 24 , 2009 , Regional Council voted to approve the project , subject to funding from higher levels of government , which was in turn approved by council on June 15 , 2011 . This was followed by a community building strategy to guide development , identify key destinations , and strengthen regional connections . The strategy , led by Urban Strategies Inc. of Toronto , consulted hundreds of individuals and stakeholders from Cambridge , Kitchener , and Waterloo . Construction began in August 2014 and service was expected to begin in late 2017 ; however , because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of rolling stock , the introduction of the light rail service was significantly delayed . The total cost of the system was estimated at $ 818 million , but in December 2017 , the overruns were estimated to total approximately $ 50 million . The Province was expected to provide $ 25 million of that amount .",

  "/wiki/SkyTrain_(Vancouver)": "SkyTrain is a light rapid transit system in the Metro Vancouver Regional District , serving Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , and surrounding municipalities . SkyTrain has 79.6 km ( 49.5 mi ) of track and uses fully automated trains on grade-separated tracks running on underground and elevated guideways , allowing SkyTrain to hold consistently high on-time reliability . The name SkyTrain was coined for the system during Expo 86 because the first line ( Expo ) principally runs on elevated guideway outside of Downtown Vancouver , providing panoramic views of the metropolitan area . SkyTrain uses the world 's second-longest cable-supported transit-only bridge , known as SkyBridge , to cross the Fraser River . With the opening of the Evergreen Extension on December 2 , 2016 , SkyTrain became the longest rapid transit system in Canada and the longest fully automated driverless system in the world . The total lengths of the Singapore MRT 's automated lines have since surpassed those of SkyTrain . SkyTrain currently has 53 stations serving three lines : Expo , Millennium , and Canada Line . The Expo Line and Millennium Line are operated by British Columbia Rapid Transit Company under contract from TransLink ( originally BC Transit ) , a regional government transportation agency . The Canada Line is operated on the same principles by the private concessionaire ProTrans BC under contract to TransLink , and is an integrated part of the regional transport system . SkyTrain uses a fare system shared with other local transit services and is policed by the Metro Vancouver Transit Police . SkyTrain attendants ( STAs ) provide first aid , directions and customer service , inspect fares , monitor train faults , and operate the trains manually if necessary .",
