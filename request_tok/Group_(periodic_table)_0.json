It is a soft , silvery-white alkali metal . Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and must be stored in mineral oil . When cut , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals , which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride . The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light : it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common . For related reasons , lithium has important uses in nuclear physics .",
  "/wiki/Group_2_element": "The alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in group 2 of the periodic table . They are beryllium ( Be ) , magnesium ( Mg ) , calcium ( Ca ) , strontium ( Sr ) , barium ( Ba ) , and radium ( Ra ) . The elements have very similar properties : they are all shiny , silvery-white , somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure . Structurally , they ( together with helium ) have in common an outer s-orbital which is full ; that is , this orbital contains its full complement of two electrons , which the alkaline earth metals readily lose to form cations with charge +2 , and an oxidation state of +2 . All the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature , although radium occurs only through the decay chain of uranium and thorium and not as a primordial element .

  "/wiki/Beryllium": "Beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4 . It is a relatively rare element in the universe , usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays . Within the cores of stars , beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements . It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals . Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl ( aquamarine , emerald ) and chrysoberyl . As a free element it is a steel-gray , strong , lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal . In structural applications , the combination of high flexural rigidity , thermal stability , thermal conductivity and low density ( 1.85 times that of water ) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components , missiles , spacecraft , and satellites . Because of its low density and atomic mass , beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation ; therefore , it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors . The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications . When added as an alloying element to aluminium , copper ( notably the alloy beryllium copper ) , iron or nickel beryllium improves many physical properties . [ example needed ] Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface . Beryllium does not form oxides until it reaches very high temperatures .",
  "/wiki/Group_3_element": "Group 3 is a group of elements in the periodic table . This group , like other d-block groups , should contain four elements , but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group . Scandium ( Sc ) and yttrium ( Y ) are always included , but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum ( La ) and actinium ( Ac ) , or by lutetium ( Lu ) and lawrencium ( Lr ) ; less frequently , it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements ( with all the lanthanides and actinides included ) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium . When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides , it subsumes the rare-earth metals . Yttrium , and less frequently scandium , are sometimes also counted as rare-earth metals . Three group 3 elements occur naturally : scandium , yttrium , and either lanthanum or lutetium . Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior , while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium . While the choice of lutetium would be in accordance with the trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors , the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block , which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to . They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions . The fourth element , either actinium or lawrencium , has only radioactive isotopes . Actinium , which occurs only in trace amounts , continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration ; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium . So far , no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element .",
  "/wiki/Scandium": "Scandium is a chemical element with the symbol Sc and atomic number 21 . A silvery-white metallic d-block element , it has historically been classified as a rare-earth element , together with yttrium and the lanthanides . It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia . Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds , but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide . Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium , which was first done in 1937 , applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s , when the positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered , and its use in such alloys remains its only major application . The global trade of scandium oxide is 15-20 tonnes per year . The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium . A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium , just as there is between beryllium and aluminium .

  "/wiki/Titanium": "Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22 . It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color , low density , and high strength . Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water , aqua regia , and chlorine . Titanium was discovered in Cornwall , Great Britain , by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology . The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits , principally rutile and ilmenite , which are widely distributed in the Earth 's crust and lithosphere ; it is found in almost all living things , as well as bodies of water , rocks , and soils . The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes . The most common compound , titanium dioxide , is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments . Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride ( TiCl4 ) , a component of smoke screens and catalysts ; and titanium trichloride ( TiCl3 ) , which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene . Titanium can be alloyed with iron , aluminium , vanadium , and molybdenum , among other elements , to produce strong , lightweight alloys for aerospace ( jet engines , missiles , and spacecraft ) , military , industrial processes ( chemicals and petrochemicals , desalination plants , pulp , and paper ) , automotive , agriculture ( farming ) , medical prostheses , orthopedic implants , dental and endodontic instruments and files , dental implants , sporting goods , jewelry , mobile phones , and other applications . The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio , the highest of any metallic element . In its unalloyed condition , titanium is as strong as some steels , but less dense .

  "/wiki/Vanadium": "Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V and atomic number 23 . It is a hard , silvery-grey , malleable transition metal . The elemental metal is rarely found in nature , but once isolated artificially , the formation of an oxide layer ( passivation ) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation . Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called brown lead , and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element , which he named erythronium ( derived from the Greek word for red , \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd , eruthr\u00f3n ) since upon heating most of the salts turned red . Four years later , he was ( erroneously ) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium . Chlorides of vanadium were generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefstr\u00f6m who thereby proved that a new element was involved , which he named vanadium after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility , Vanad\u00eds ( Freyja ) . Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds . Del Rio 's lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for its vanadium content . In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element . Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 minerals and in fossil fuel deposits . It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag . Other countries produce it either from magnetite directly , flue dust of heavy oil , or as a byproduct of uranium mining .",

  "/wiki/Chromium": "Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol Cr and atomic number 24 . It is the first element in group 6 . It is a steely-grey , lustrous , hard and brittle transition metal . Chromium is the main additive in stainless steel , to which it adds anti-corrosive properties . Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing . Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum , with almost 90% of infrared light being reflected . The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 , chr\u014dma , meaning color , because many chromium compounds are intensely colored . Ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium . Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness . A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel . Stainless steel and chrome plating ( electroplating with chromium ) together comprise 85% of the commercial use .

  "/wiki/Manganese": "Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25 . It is not found as a free element in nature ; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron . Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses , particularly in stainless steels . Historically , manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece , which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite . By the mid-18th century , Swedish-German chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine . Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite ( now known to be manganese dioxide ) contained a new element , but they were unable to isolate it . Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774 , which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon . Manganese phosphating is used for rust and corrosion prevention on steel . Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors , which depend on the oxidation state of the ions . The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers . Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode ( electron acceptor ) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries . In biology , manganese ( II ) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions .",

  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion .",

  "/wiki/Cobalt": "Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27 . Like nickel , cobalt is found in the Earth 's crust only in chemically combined form , save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron . The free element , produced by reductive smelting , is a hard , lustrous , silver-gray metal . Cobalt-based blue pigments ( cobalt blue ) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints , and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass , but the color was later thought to be due to the known metal bismuth . Miners had long used the name kobold ore ( German for goblin ore ) for some of the blue-pigment-producing minerals ; they were so named because they were poor in known metals , and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted . In 1735 , such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal ( the first discovered since ancient times ) , and this was ultimately named for the kobold . Today , some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores , such as cobaltite ( CoAsS ) . The element is , however , more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining . The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production . World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes ( according to Natural Resources Canada ) , and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50% . Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries , and in the manufacture of magnetic , wear-resistant and high-strength alloys .

  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2% nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite .",

  "/wiki/Group_15_element": "A pnictogen /\u02c8n\u026akt\u0259d\u0292\u0259n/ ( from Ancient Greek : \u03c0\u03bd\u1fd1\u0301\u03b3\u03c9 to choke and -gen , generator ) is any of the chemical elements in group 15 of the periodic table . This group is also known as the nitrogen family . It consists of the elements nitrogen ( N ) , phosphorus ( P ) , arsenic ( As ) , antimony ( Sb ) , bismuth ( Bi ) , and perhaps the chemically uncharacterized synthetic element moscovium ( Mc ) . In modern IUPAC notation , it is called Group 15 . In CAS and the old IUPAC systems it was called Group VA and Group VB respectively ( pronounced group five A and group five B , V for the Roman numeral 5 ) . In the field of semiconductor physics , it is still usually called Group V. The five ( V ) in the historical names comes from the pentavalency of nitrogen , reflected by the stoichiometry of compounds such as N2O5 . They have also been called the pentels .",
  "/wiki/Nitrogen": "Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7 . It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 . Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time , Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first . The name nitrog\u00e8ne was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 , when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates . Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote , from the Greek \u1f00\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 no life , as it is an asphyxiant gas ; this name is instead used in many languages , such as French , Russian , Romanian and Turkish , and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine , azides and azo compounds . Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table , often called the pnictogens . The name comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd to choke , directly referencing nitrogen 's asphyxiating properties . It is a common element in the universe , estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen , a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N2 . Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth 's atmosphere , making it the most abundant uncombined element . Nitrogen occurs in all organisms , primarily in amino acids ( and thus proteins ) , in the nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA ) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate . The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass , the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen .",
  "/wiki/Group_16_element": "The chalcogens ( /\u02c8k\u00e6lk\u0259d\u0292\u026anz/ ) are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table . This group is also known as the oxygen family . It consists of the elements oxygen ( O ) , sulfur ( S ) , selenium ( Se ) , tellurium ( Te ) , and the radioactive element polonium ( Po ) . The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium ( Lv ) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well . Often , oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens , sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term chalcogen altogether , due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium . The word chalcogen is derived from a combination of the Greek word khalk\u03ccs ( \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) principally meaning copper ( the term was also used for bronze/brass , any metal in the poetic sense , ore or coin ) , and the Latinised Greek word gen\u0113s , meaning born or produced . Sulfur has been known since antiquity , and oxygen was recognized as an element in the 18th century . Selenium , tellurium and polonium were discovered in the 19th century , and livermorium in 2000 . All of the chalcogens have six valence electrons , leaving them two electrons short of a full outer shell . Their most common oxidation states are \u22122 , +2 , +4 , and +6 . They have relatively low atomic radii , especially the lighter ones . Lighter chalcogens are typically nontoxic in their elemental form , and are often critical to life , while the heavier chalcogens are typically toxic .",
  "/wiki/Oxygen": "Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8 . It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table , a highly reactive nonmetal , and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds . By mass , oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2 . Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth 's atmosphere . As compounds including oxides , the element makes up almost half of the Earth 's crust . Dioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth 's atmosphere by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide . Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . Another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( O3 ) , strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation . However , ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant .",
  "/wiki/Group_17_element": "The halogens ( /\u02c8h\u00e6l\u0259d\u0292\u0259n , \u02c8he\u026a- , -lo\u028a- , -\u02ccd\u0292\u025bn/ ) are a group in the periodic table consisting of five chemically related elements : fluorine ( F ) , chlorine ( Cl ) , bromine ( Br ) , iodine ( I ) , and astatine ( At ) . The artificially created element 117 tennessine , Ts may also be a halogen . In the modern IUPAC nomenclature , this group is known as group 17 . The name halogen means salt-producing . When halogens react with metals they produce a wide range of salts , including calcium fluoride , sodium chloride ( common table salt ) , silver bromide and potassium iodide . The group of halogens is the only periodic table group that contains elements in three of the main states of matter at standard temperature and pressure . All of the halogens form acids when bonded to hydrogen . Most halogens are typically produced from minerals or salts . The middle halogens , that is chlorine , bromine and iodine , are often used as disinfectants . Organobromides are the most important class of flame retardants , while elemental halogens are dangerous and can be lethally toxic .",
  "/wiki/Fluorine": "Fluorine is a chemical element with the symbol F and atomic number 9 . It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions . As the most electronegative element , it is extremely reactive , as it reacts with all other elements , except for argon , neon , and helium . Among the elements , fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance . Fluorite , the primary mineral source of fluorine which gave the element its name , was first described in 1529 ; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting , the Latin verb fluo meaning flow gave the mineral its name . Proposed as an element in 1810 , fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds , and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts . Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis , a process still employed for modern production . Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment , its largest application , began during the Manhattan Project in World War II . Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine , most commercial applications use fluorine compounds , with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking . The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides , or into cryolite , which plays a key role in aluminium refining . Molecules containing a carbon-fluorine bond often have very high chemical and thermal stability ; their major uses are as refrigerants , electrical insulation and cookware , the last as PTFE ( Teflon ) . Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C-F bonds .",
  "/wiki/Group_18_element": "The noble gases ( historically also the inert gases ; sometimes referred to as aerogens ) make up a group of chemical elements with similar properties ; under standard conditions , they are all odorless , colorless , monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity . The six naturally occurring noble gases are helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , argon ( Ar ) , krypton ( Kr ) , xenon ( Xe ) , and the radioactive radon ( Rn ) . Oganesson ( Og ) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects ; its chemistry has not yet been investigated . For the first six periods of the periodic table , the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18 . Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions . The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted . For example , argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing ; also , helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen , nitrogen and carbon dioxide ( hypercapnia ) toxicity . The properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure : their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be full , giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions , and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds . The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together , differing by less than 10 \u00b0C ( 18 \u00b0F ) ; that is , they are liquids over only a small temperature range . Neon , argon , krypton , and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation . Helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas , using cryogenic gas separation techniques , and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium , thorium , or uranium compounds . Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting , welding , and space exploration .",
  "/wiki/Helium": "Helium ( from Greek : \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , romanized : Helios , lit . 'Sun ' ) is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2 . It is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , inert , monatomic gas , the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table . Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements . Helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe ( hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant ) . It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass , which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined . Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and in Jupiter . This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy ( per nucleon ) of helium-4 , with respect to the next three elements after helium . This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay . Most helium in the universe is helium-4 , the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang . Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars . Helium is named for the Greek Titan of the Sun , Helios .",
  "/wiki/Neon": "Neon is a chemical element with the symbol Ne and atomic number 10 . It is a noble gas . Neon is a colorless , odorless , inert monatomic gas under standard conditions , with about two-thirds the density of air . It was discovered ( along with krypton and xenon ) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air , after nitrogen , oxygen , argon and carbon dioxide were removed . Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum . The name neon is derived from the Greek word , \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd , neuter singular form of \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 ( neos ) , meaning new . Neon is chemically inert , and no uncharged neon compounds are known . The compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules , molecules held together by van der Waals forces and clathrates . During cosmic nucleogenesis of the elements , large amounts of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars . Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system ( it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen , helium , oxygen and carbon ) , it is rare on Earth . It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume ( this is about the same as the molecular or mole fraction ) and a smaller fraction in Earth 's crust . The reason for neon 's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner ( terrestrial ) planets is that neon is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids ."
