While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office . It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association , but notably not part of the European Union , the European Economic Area or the Eurozone .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
  "/wiki/Dersu_Uzala_(1975_film)": "Dersu Uzala ( Russian : \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0423\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430 , Japanese : \u30c7\u30eb\u30b9\u00b7\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc\u30e9 , romanized : Derusu Uz\u0101ra ; alternative U.S. title : Dersu Uzala : The Hunter ) is a 1975 Soviet-Japanese co-production film directed by Akira Kurosawa , his first non-Japanese-language film and his first and only 70mm film . The film is based on the 1923 memoir Dersu Uzala ( which took its name from the native trapper ) by Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev , about his exploration of the Sikhote-Alin region of the Russian Far East over the course of multiple expeditions in the early 20th century . Shot almost entirely outdoors in the Russian Far East wilderness , the film explores the theme of a native of the forests who is fully integrated into his environment , leading a style of life that will inevitably be destroyed by the advance of civilization . It is also about the growth of respect and deep friendship between two men of profoundly different backgrounds , and about the difficulty of coping with the loss of strength and ability that comes with old age . The film won the 1976 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film , the Golden Prize and the Prix FIPRESCI at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival and a number of other awards . It sold 20.4 million tickets in the Soviet Union and made $ 1.2 million in the US and Canada .",
  "/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa": "Akira Kurosawa ( Japanese : \u9ed2\u6fa4\u660e or \u9ed2\u6ca2\u660e or \u9ed1\u6fa4\u660e Kurosawa Akira ; March 23 , 1910 - September 6 , 1998 ) was a Japanese film director and screenwriter , who directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years . He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) . After the 1960s he became much less prolific ; even so , his later work - including his final two epics , Kagemusha ( 1980 ) and Ran ( 1985 ) - continued to win awards , though more often abroad than in Japan . In 1990 , he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement ."
