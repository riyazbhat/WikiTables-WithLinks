The road travels east from Nome , following the shore of the Bering Sea until it reaches the ghost town of Solomon . From there , the route travels northeast through the interior of the Seward Peninsula before it terminates on the south bank of the Niukluk River , south of Council . One of three highways traveling from Nome to surrounding communities , the highway is disconnected from the rest of the Alaska Highway System . The route is unpaved for its entire length and becomes impassable for automobiles in the winter outside of a short portion immediately outside of Nome . The portion of the road between Nome and Solomon is part of the Iditarod Trail and the highway passes several historic sites associated with the trail and the area 's gold mining history . The route began as a collection of informal trails connecting Nome with mining communities established on the peninsula at the beginning of the 20th century . In 1906 , the Alaska Road Commission constructed a wagon road along most of the length of the trails from Nome to Council . Because of the value of the gold coming from the Council area , this road quickly became the main artery for the region and the Road Commission spent significant amounts of money improving and maintaining the route into the 1930s . However , the road had fallen below state standards by the 1960s and 70s and projects were undertaken to update the highway and replace river-crossing ferries with bridges . The road has been studied since the 1950s as part of a potential Fairbanks-Nome Highway ; the expected cost of such a project has consistently prevented any development .",
