  "/wiki/Found_footage_(pseudo-documentary)": "Found footage is a film subgenre in which all or a substantial part of the work is presented as if it were discovered film or video recordings . The events on screen are typically seen through the camera of one or more of the characters involved , often accompanied by their real-time , off-camera commentary . For added realism , the cinematography may be done by the actors themselves as they perform , and shaky camera work and naturalistic acting are routinely employed . The footage may be presented as if it were raw and complete or as if it had been edited into a narrative by those who found it . The most common use of the technique is in horror films ( e.g. , Cannibal Holocaust , The Blair Witch Project , Paranormal Activity , REC , Cloverfield ) , where the footage is purported to be the only surviving record of the events , with the participants now missing or dead . It has also been used in science-fiction ( e.g. , Chronicle , Project Almanac , Europa Report ) , drama ( e.g. , Zero Day , Exhibit A ) , comedy ( e.g. , Project X ) and family ( e.g. , Earth to Echo ) films . Although found footage was originally the name of an entirely different genre , it is now frequently used to describe pseudo-documentaries crafted with this narrative technique . The film magazine Variety has , for example , used the term faux found-footage film to describe the 2012 film Grave Encounters 2 . Film scholar David Bordwell criticizes this recent usage , arguing that it sows confusion , and instead prefers the term discovered footage for the narrative gimmick . Found-footage films typically employ one or more of four cinematic techniques - first-person perspective , pseudo-documentary or mockumentary , news footage , or surveillance footage - according to an analysis of 500 found-footage films conducted by Found Footage Critic .",

  "/wiki/Biographical_film": "A biographical film , or biopic ( /\u02c8ba\u026ao\u028ap\u026ak/ ; abbreviation for biographical motion picture ) , is a film that dramatizes the life of a non-fictional or historically-based person or people . Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character 's real name is used . They differ from docudrama films and historical drama films in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person 's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives . [ original research ? ] Because the figures portrayed are actual people , whose actions and characteristics are known to the public ( or at least historically documented ) , biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses . [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley , Johnny Depp , Jim Carrey , Robert Downey Jr. , Jamie Foxx and Eddie Redmayne all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics : [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi ( 1982 ) , Depp as Ed Wood in Ed Wood ( 1994 ) , Carrey as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon ( 1999 ) , Downey as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin ( 1992 ) , Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray ( 2004 ) , and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything ( 2014 ) .

Biopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis . Custen , in Bio/Pics : How Hollywood Constructed Public History ( 1992 ) , regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era , and in particular , Darryl F. Zanuck . On the other hand , Bingham 's 2010 study Whose Lives Are They Anyway ? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study , Film/Genre . Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other , the former generally dealing with great accomplishments , the latter generally dealing with female victimization .",
