In a small zone at the northern edge of the syenite , the T-Zone , minerals like bastn\u00e4site , phenakite and xenotime can be found . Within the Mackenzie mining district , Thor Lake may contain some of the largest deposits of light and heavy rare-earth element ( REE ) ores . The major elements of these ores are europium , terbium , dysprosium , neodymium , gallium , niobium , thorium , zirconium and beryllium . A significant proportion of the REE deposits lie within the boundaries of the Nechalacho Rare Earth Element Project , funded by Avalon Rare Metals . The extraction of these resources could be important for the global REE production , which almost exclusively occurs in China , especially around the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Bayan Obo",
