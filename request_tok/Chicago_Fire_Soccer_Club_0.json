  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces .

  "/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(Major_League_Soccer)": "The Homegrown Player Rule is a Major League Soccer program that allows MLS teams to sign local players from their own development academies directly to MLS first team rosters . Before the creation of the rule in 2008 , every player entering Major League Soccer would have to be assigned through one of the existing MLS player allocation processes , such as the MLS SuperDraft . MLS roster rules allow a team to sign players to contracts similar to Generation adidas contracts , which do not count against the MLS salary budget and may earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . MLS has since removed this wording from the roster rules . That means homegrown players will not count against the salary budget only if they are registered using supplemental roster slots , but will still count against the salary budget if they are registered using senior roster slots . There is , however , supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds . To place a player on its homegrown player list , making him eligible to sign as a homegrown player , players must have resided in that club 's home territory and participated in the club 's youth development system for at least one year , as well as meeting other unspecified league requirements . If a player on a team 's homegrown list goes to college or U17 , U20 , and U23 United States men 's national soccer teams , he remains eligible to sign as a homegrown player at any time as long as he is registered with the club as a homegrown player first .

Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture .
