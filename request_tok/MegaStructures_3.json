The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area",

  "/wiki/Aircraft_carrier": "An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase , equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying , arming , deploying , and recovering aircraft . Typically , it is the capital ship of a fleet , as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations . Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighters , strike aircraft , helicopters , and other types of aircraft . While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers , it is currently not possible to land them . By its diplomatic and tactical power , its mobility , its autonomy and the variety of its means , the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets . Tactically or even strategically , it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of a fleet . One of its great advantages is that , by sailing in international waters , it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries , reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone",

Other artificial reefs are purpose built ( e.g . the reef balls ) from PVC or concrete . Shipwrecks may become artificial reefs when preserved on the sea floor . Regardless of construction method , artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles , corals , and oysters attach ; the accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structure and food for assemblages of fish",
  "/wiki/USS_Oriskany_(CV-34)": "USS Oriskany ( CV/CVA-34 ) - nicknamed Mighty O , and occasionally referred to as the O-boat - was one of the few Essex-class aircraft carriers completed after World War II for the United States Navy . The ship was named for the Battle of Oriskany during the Revolutionary War . The history of Oriskany differs considerably from that of her sister ships . Originally designed as a long-hulled Essex-class ship ( considered by some authorities to be a separate class , the Ticonderoga class ) her construction was suspended in 1946 . She eventually was commissioned in 1950 after conversion to an updated design called SCB-27 ( 27-Charlie ) , which became the template for modernization of 14 other Essex-class ships . Oriskany was the final Essex-class ship completed . She operated primarily in the Pacific into the 1970s , earning two battle stars for service in the Korean War , and five for service in the Vietnam War . In 1966 , one of the worst shipboard fires since World War II broke out on Oriskany when a magnesium flare was accidentally ignited ; forty-four men died in the fire . Oriskany 's post-service history also differs considerably from that of her sister ships . Decommissioned in 1976 , she was sold for scrap in 1995 , but was repossessed in 1997 because nothing was being done . In 2004 , it was decided to sink her as an artificial reef off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico . After much environmental review and remediation to remove toxic substances , she was carefully sunk in May 2006 , settling in an upright position at a depth accessible to recreational divers",
  "/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico": "The Gulf of Mexico ( Spanish : Golfo de M\u00e9xico ) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean , largely surrounded by the North American continent .

Macau was formerly a colony of the Portuguese Empire , after Ming China leased the territory as a trading post in 1557 . Between 1557 and 1887 , Macau was governed by the Portuguese under Chinese authority and sovereignty with the Portuguese paying an annual land rent . In 1887 , Portugal was given perpetual colonial rights for Macau which gave Portuguese sovereignty over Macau . The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 1999 , when it was transferred to China . As a special administrative region , Macau maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China . Originally a sparsely populated collection of coastal islands , the territory has become a major resort city and the top destination for gambling tourism .

  "/wiki/Maglev_train": "Maglev ( derived from magnetic levitation ) is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets , one set to repel and push the train up off the track , and another set to move the elevated train ahead , taking advantage of the lack of friction . Along certain medium-range routes ( usually 320 to 640 km [ 200 to 400 mi ] ) , maglev can compete favorably with high-speed rail and airplanes . With maglev technology there are no moving parts . The train travels along a guideway of magnets which control the train 's stability and speed . Maglev trains are therefore quieter and smoother than conventional trains , and have the potential for much higher speeds . Maglev vehicles have set several speed records and maglev trains can accelerate and decelerate much faster than conventional trains ; the only practical limitation is the safety and comfort of the passengers . The power needed for levitation is typically not a large percentage of the overall energy consumption of a high-speed maglev system . Overcoming drag , which makes all land transport more energy intensive at higher speeds , takes the most energy . Vactrain technology has been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation . Maglev systems have been much more expensive to construct than conventional train systems , although the simpler construction of maglev vehicles makes them cheaper to manufacture and maintain .
