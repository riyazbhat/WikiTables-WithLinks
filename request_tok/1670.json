  "/wiki/University_of_Sheffield": "The University of Sheffield ( informally Sheffield University ) is a public research university in Sheffield , South Yorkshire , England . It received its royal charter in 1905 as successor to the University College of Sheffield , which was established in 1897 by the merger of Sheffield Medical School ( founded in 1828 ) , Firth College ( 1879 ) and Sheffield Technical School ( 1884 ) . Sheffield is a multi-campus university predominantly over two campus areas : the Western Bank and the St George 's . The university is organised into five academic faculties composed of multiple departments . It had 20,005 undergraduate and 8,710 postgraduate students in 2016/17 .

  "/wiki/Bose\u2013Einstein_condensate": "A Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) is a state of matter ( also called the fifth state of matter ) which is typically formed when a gas of bosons at low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero ( -273.15 \u00b0C ) . Under such conditions , a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state , at which point microscopic quantum phenomena , particularly wavefunction interference , become apparent macroscopically . A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density , about one-hundred-thousandth ( 1/100,000 ) the density of normal air , to ultra-low temperatures . This state was first predicted , generally , in 1924-1925 by Albert Einstein following a paper written by Satyendra Nath Bose , although Bose came up with the pioneering paper on the new statistics .",

  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
  "/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations that is dedicated to providing the world with objective , scientific information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change , its natural , political , and economic impacts and risks , and possible response options . The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and was later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly . Membership is open to all members of the WMO and UN . The IPCC produces reports that contribute to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , the main international treaty on climate change . The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic ( human-induced ) interference with the climate system . The IPCC 's Fifth Assessment Report was a critical scientific input into the UNFCCC 's Paris Agreement in 2015 . IPCC reports cover the scientific , technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change , its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation . The IPCC does not carry out original research , nor does it monitor climate or related phenomena itself . Rather , it assesses published literature , including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources . However , the IPCC can be said to stimulate research in climate science . Chapters of IPCC reports often close with sections on limitations and knowledge or research gaps , and the announcement of an IPCC special report can catalyse research activity in that area . Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute on a voluntary basis to writing and reviewing reports , which are then reviewed by governments .",

  "/wiki/Dielectric": "A dielectric ( or dielectric material ) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field . When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field , electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization . Because of dielectric polarization , positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field ( for example , if the field is moving in the positive x-axis , the negative charges will shift in the negative x-axis ) . This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself . If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules , those molecules not only become polarized , but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field . The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials . Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in electronics , optics , solid-state physics , and cell biophysics .",
