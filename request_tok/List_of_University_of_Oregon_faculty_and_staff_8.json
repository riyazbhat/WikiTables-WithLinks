  "/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider": "The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is the world 's largest and highest-energy particle collider and the largest machine in the world . It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and hundreds of universities and laboratories , as well as more than 100 countries . It lies in a tunnel 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) in circumference and as deep as 175 metres ( 574 ft ) beneath the France-Switzerland border near Geneva . First collisions were achieved in 2010 at an energy of 3.5 tera electronvolts ( TeV ) per beam , about four times the previous world record . After upgrades it reached 6.5 TeV per beam ( 13 TeV total collision energy , the present world record ) . At the end of 2018 , it entered a two-year shutdown period for further upgrades . The collider has four crossing points , around which are positioned seven detectors , each designed for certain kinds of research . The LHC primarily collides proton beams , but it can also use beams of heavy ions : Lead-lead collisions and proton-lead collisions are typically done for one month per year . The aim of the LHC 's detectors is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics , including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson and searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories , as well as other unsolved questions of physics .",

  "/wiki/LIGO": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool . Two large observatories were built in the United States with the aim of detecting gravitational waves by laser interferometry . These can detect a change in the 4 km mirror spacing of less than a ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton . The initial LIGO observatories were funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and were conceived , built and are operated by Caltech and MIT . They collected data from 2002 to 2010 but no gravitational waves were detected . The Advanced LIGO Project to enhance the original LIGO detectors began in 2008 and continues to be supported by the NSF , with important contributions from the United Kingdom 's Science and Technology Facilities Council , the Max Planck Society of Germany , and the Australian Research Council . The improved detectors began operation in 2015 . The detection of gravitational waves was reported in 2016 by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration ( LSC ) and the Virgo Collaboration with the international participation of scientists from several universities and research institutions . Scientists involved in the project and the analysis of the data for gravitational-wave astronomy are organized by the LSC , which includes more than 1000 scientists worldwide , as well as 440,000 active Einstein @ Home users as of December 2016 [ update ] . LIGO is the largest and most ambitious project ever funded by the NSF . In 2017 , the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss , Kip Thorne and Barry C.

  "/wiki/International_Linear_Collider": "The International Linear Collider ( ILC ) is a proposed linear particle accelerator . It is planned to have a collision energy of 500 GeV initially , with the possibility for a later upgrade to 1000 GeV ( 1 TeV ) . Although early proposed locations for the ILC were Japan , Europe ( CERN ) and the USA ( Fermilab ) , the Kitakami highland , in the Iwate prefecture of northern Japan , has been the focus of ILC design efforts since 2013 . The Japanese government is willing to contribute half of the costs , according to the coordinator of study for detectors at the ILC . The ILC would collide electrons with positrons . It will be between 30 km and 50 km ( 19-31 mi ) long , more than 10 times as long as the 50 GeV Stanford Linear Accelerator , the longest existing linear particle accelerator . The proposal is based on previous similar proposals from Europe , the U.S. , and Japan . Studies for an alternative project , the Compact Linear Collider ( CLIC ) are also underway , which would operate at higher energies ( up to 3 TeV ) in a machine of length similar to the ILC . These two projects , CLIC and the ILC , have been unified under the Linear Collider Collaboration .",

  "/wiki/Scientific_skepticism": "The skeptical movement ( British spelling : sceptical movement ) is a modern social movement based on the idea of scientific skepticism ( also called rational skepticism ) . Scientific skepticism involves the application of skeptical philosophy , critical-thinking skills , and knowledge of science and its methods to empirical claims , while remaining agnostic or neutral to non-empirical claims [ definition needed ] ( except those that directly impact the practice of science ) . The movement has the goal of investigating claims made on fringe topics and determining whether they are supported by empirical research and are reproducible , as part of a methodological norm pursuing the extension of certified knowledge . The process followed is sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry . Roots of the movement date at least from the 19th century , when people started publicly raising questions regarding the unquestioned acceptance of claims about spiritism , of various widely-held superstitions , and of pseudoscience . Publications such as those of the Dutch Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij ( 1881 ) also targeted medical quackery . Using as a template the Belgian organization founded in 1949 , Comit\u00e9 Para , Americans Paul Kurtz and Marcello Truzzi founded the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ( CSICOP ) , in Amherst , New York in 1976 .

  "/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem": "The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic . The problem is not known to be solvable in polynomial time nor to be NP-complete , and therefore may be in the computational complexity class NP-intermediate . It is known that the graph isomorphism problem is in the low hierarchy of class NP , which implies that it is not NP-complete unless the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level . At the same time , isomorphism for many special classes of graphs can be solved in polynomial time , and in practice graph isomorphism can often be solved efficiently . This problem is a special case of the subgraph isomorphism problem , which asks whether a given graph G contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to another given graph H ; this problem is known to be NP-complete . It is also known to be a special case of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric group . In the area of image recognition it is known as the exact graph matching .",
  "/wiki/Group_theory": "In mathematics and abstract algebra , group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups . The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra : other well-known algebraic structures , such as rings , fields , and vector spaces , can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms . Groups recur throughout mathematics , and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra . Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right . Various physical systems , such as crystals and the hydrogen atom , may be modelled by symmetry groups . Thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics , chemistry , and materials science . Group theory is also central to public key cryptography . One of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century was the collaborative effort , taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980 , that culminated in a complete classification of finite simple groups .",

From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",
