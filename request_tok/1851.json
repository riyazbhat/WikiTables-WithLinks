They primarily live in the Arab states in Western Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa and western Indian Ocean islands ( including the Comoros ) , as well as in significant numbers in the Americas , Western Europe , Indonesia , Israel , Turkey and Iran . The Arab diaspora is established around the world . The first mention of Arabs is from the mid-ninth century BCE as a tribal people in eastern and southern Syria and the north of the Arabian Peninsula . The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-612 BCE ) , and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian ( 626-539 BCE ) , Achaemenid ( 539-332 BCE ) , Seleucid , and Parthian empires . Arab tribes , most notably the Ghassanids and Lakhmids , begin to appear in the southern Syrian Desert from the mid 3rd century CE onward , during the mid to later stages of the Roman and Sasanian empires . Before the expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate ( 632-661 C.E . ) , Arab referred to any of the largely nomadic and settled Semitic people from the Arabian Peninsula , Syrian Desert , and North and Lower Mesopotamia . Today , Arab refers to a large number of people whose native regions form the Arab world due to the spread of Arabs and the Arabic language throughout the region during the early Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries and the subsequent Arabisation of indigenous populations . The Arabs forged the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and the Fatimid ( 901-1071 ) caliphates , whose borders reached southern France in the west , China in the east , Anatolia in the north , and the Sudan in the south . This was one of the largest land empires in history . In the early 20th century , the First World War signalled the end of the Ottoman Empire ; which had ruled much of the Arab world since conquering the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 .",

They also form a significant diaspora , with Greek communities established around the world . Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea , but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas , where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age . Until the early 20th century , Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula , the western coast of Asia Minor , the Black Sea coast , Cappadocia in central Anatolia , Egypt , the Balkans , Cyprus , and Constantinople . Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization . The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens , Thessalonica , Alexandria , Smyrna , and Constantinople at various periods . In recent times , most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus . The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor . Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries .

Genetic findings appear to confirm that the Romani came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago . Genetic research published in the European Journal of Human Genetics revealed that over 70 % of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma . They are a dispersed people , but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe , especially Central , Eastern and Southern Europe ( including Turkey , Spain and Southern France ) . The Romani arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1,000 years ago . They have been associated with another Indo-Aryan group , the Dom people : the two groups have been said to have separated from each other or , at least , to share a similar history . Specifically , the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 6th and 11th century . The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies ( or Gipsies ) , which is considered by some Roma people to be pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity . Beginning in 1888 , the Gypsy Lore Society started to publish a journal that was meant to dispel rumors about their lifestyle . Since the 19th century , some Romani have also migrated to the Americas . There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States ; and 800,000 in Brazil , most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe . Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from people deported by the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition .",

The term Huaxia represents the collective Neolithic confederation of agricultural tribes Hua and Xia who settled along the Central Plains around the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern China . The two tribes were the ancestors of the modern Han Chinese people that gave birth to Chinese civilization .

Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory . Prior to World War II , the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million , representing around 0.7 % of the world population at that time . Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust . Since then the population has slowly risen again , and as of 2018 [ update ] was estimated at 14.6-17.8 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank , less than 0.2 % of the total world population .

After World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire , the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres . However , that promise was nullified three years later , when the Treaty of Lausanne set the boundaries of modern Turkey and made no such provision , leaving Kurds with minority status in their respective countries . This fact has led to numerous genocides and rebellions , along with the current ongoing armed guerrilla conflicts in Turkey , Iran , and Syria / Rojava .

  "/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)": "Malays ( Malay : Orang Melayu , Jawi : \u0623\u0648\u0631\u06a0 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0648 ) are an Austronesian ethnic group and nation native to the Malay Peninsula , eastern Sumatra of Indonesia and coastal Borneo , as well as the smaller islands which lie between these locations - areas that are collectively known as the Malay world . These locations are today part of the nations of Malaysia ( Malay nation state ) , Brunei , Singapore , Indonesia and Southern Thailand . There is considerable genetic , linguistic , cultural , artistic , and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups , mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within Maritime Southeast Asia . Historically , the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier Malayic-speaking Austronesians and Austroasiatic tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms , notably Brunei , Kedah , Langkasuka , Gangga Negara , Chi Tu , Nakhon Si Thammarat , Pahang , Melayu and Srivijaya . The advent of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history , the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy . Common definitive markers of a Malayness - the religion of Islam , the Malay language and traditions - are thought to have been promulgated during this era , resulting in the ethnogenesis of the Malay as a major ethnoreligious group in the region . In literature , architecture , culinary traditions , traditional dress , performing arts , martial arts , and royal court traditions , Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated . The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants , particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak , Dayak , Orang Asli and the Orang Laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation . Today , some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia , termed as anak dagang ( traders ) and who predominantly consist of Banjar , Bugis , Minangkabau people and Acehnese peoples , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries . Throughout their history , the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics . They absorbed , shared and transmitted numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups , such as those of Minang , Acehnese , and to some degree Javanese culture ; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture .

They speak Nubian languages , part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages . Early Neolithic settlements from prehistoric Egypt have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC , with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley . Parts of Nubia , such as Ta-Seti ( the first nome or administrative region of ancient Egypt ) , were continuously a part of ancient Egypt throughout the dynastic era . Other parts of Nubia , particularly Lower or Upper Nubia , were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Mero\u00eb or the Kingdom of Kush . However , by the Twenty-fifth Dynasty , all of Nubia was united with Egypt , extending down to what is now Khartoum . Towards the end of the dynastic era , Upper Nubia broke off from Egypt proper . During that time , the Nubians founded a dynasty that ruled Upper and Lower Egypt in the eighth century BC . As warriors , the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow . In the medieval period the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms : Nobatia in the north , Makuria in the center and Alodia in the south . Today , Africans of Nubian descent primarily live in southern Egypt , especially in the Luxor and Aswan area , and in northern Sudan , particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egyptian-Sudanese border and al Dabbah . Additionally , several groups known as the Hill Nubians live in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state , Sudan .",
  "/wiki/Persian_people": "The Persians are an Iranian ethnic group that make up over half the population of Iran . They share a common cultural system and are native speakers of the Persian language , as well as languages closely related to Persian . The ancient Persians were originally an ancient Iranian people who migrated to the region of Persis , corresponding to the modern province of Fars in southwestern Iran , by the ninth century BC . Together with their compatriot allies , they established and ruled some of the world 's most powerful empires , well-recognized for their massive cultural , political , and social influence covering much of the territory and population of the ancient world . Throughout history , Persians have contributed greatly to art and science . Persian literature is one of the world 's most prominent literary traditions . In contemporary terminology , people of Persian heritage native specifically to present-day Afghanistan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan are referred to as Tajiks , whereas those in the Caucasus ( primarily in the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan and the Russian federal subject of Dagestan ) , albeit heavily assimilated , are referred to as Tats . However , historically , the terms Tajik and Tat were used as synonymous and interchangeable with Persian . Many influential Persian figures hailed from outside Iran 's present-day borders to the northeast in Central Asia and Afghanistan and to a lesser extent to the northwest in the Caucasus proper . In historical contexts , especially in English , Persians may be defined more loosely to cover all subjects of the ancient Persian polities , regardless of ethnic background ."
