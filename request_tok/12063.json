A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time .

Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) .

The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis .

During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s .

The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs .

By 1968 , Rosentover had left the organization and been superseded by commissioner Cosmo Iacavazzi . In 1965 , three of the franchises ( the Hartford Charter Oaks , Newark Bears and Springfield Acorns ) joined with five teams from the United Football League to create the Continental Football League . The league picked up four franchises from that league when it folded in 1969 ( Norfolk Neptunes , Orlando Panthers , Jersey Jays and Indianapolis Capitols ) ; the Neptunes and Panthers were exactly the same teams as the Acorns and Bears respectively , having relocated during their time in the CoFL . In 1970 , the Orlando Panthers signed a husband and wife duo , Steven and Patricia Palinkas , as a kicker and holder respectively . Steven did not make the team , but Patricia did , making her the first female professional football player . Other notable ACFL players included Pro Bowl fullback Marvin Hubbard , league leading running back Mel Meeks , kicker Booth Lusteg , three-time championship winning quarterback Jim The King Corcoran , eventual 11-year NFL veteran Bob Tucker , and offensive lineman Paul Dr. Z Zimmermann , who shortly after his retirement began an over 40-year career as a sportswriter , much of that time with Sports Illustrated ."
