The International Cross Country Championships featured a number of running greats , including : Alfred Shrubb ( the inaugural race winner ) and Jean Bouin in its early years , Frank Sando who won twice , as well as Jack Holden and Alain Mimoun who both won the race a record four times , and then Franjo Mihali\u0107 , Gaston Roelants and David Bedford in its later years .
