  "/wiki/Thomas_Edison": "Thomas Alva Edison ( February 11 , 1847 - October 18 , 1931 ) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America 's greatest inventor . He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation , mass communication , sound recording , and motion pictures . These inventions , which include the phonograph , the motion picture camera , and the long-lasting , practical electric light bulb , have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world . He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention , working with many researchers and employees . He established the first industrial research laboratory . Edison was raised in the American Midwest ; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator , which inspired some of his earliest inventions . In 1876 , he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park , New Jersey , where many of his early inventions were developed . He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers , Florida in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone , and a laboratory in West Orange , New Jersey that featured the world 's first film studio , the Black Maria . He was a prolific inventor , holding 1,093 US patents in his name , as well as patents in other countries . Edison married twice and fathered six children . He died in 1931 of the complications of diabetes .",

  "/wiki/Field_recording": "Field recording is the term used for an audio recording produced outside a recording studio , and the term applies to recordings of both natural and human-produced sounds . It also applies to sound recordings like electromagnetic fields or vibrations using different microphones like a passive magnetic antenna for electromagnetic recordings or contact microphones . For underwater field recordings a field recordist uses hydrophones to capture the sounds of wales , dolphins or movements . These recordings are very useful for sound designers . Field recording of natural sounds , also called phonography ( a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to photography ) , was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work in the field , and foley work for film . With the introduction of high-quality , portable recording equipment , it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself . In the 1970s , both processed and natural phonographic recordings , ( pioneered by Irv Teibel 's Environments series ) , became popular . Field recordings may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings , such as the ethnomusicology recordings pioneered by John Lomax , Nonesuch Records , and Vanguard Records .",

  "/wiki/Mapleson_Cylinders": "The Mapleson Cylinders are a group of more than 100 phonograph cylinders recorded live at the Metropolitan Opera House , primarily in the years 1901-1903 , by the Met librarian Lionel Mapleson ( a nephew of impresario James Henry Mapleson ) . The cylinders contain short fragments of actual operatic performances from the Italian , German and French repertoires . Despite their variable quality of sound ( some are quite good while others are nearly inaudible ) , the cylinders have great historical value thanks to the unique aural picture they document of pre-World War I singers in performance at an opera house with a full orchestra . Other contemporary recordings only capture singers as recorded with piano or a severely truncated orchestra in a boxy commercial recording studio . The Mapleson cylinders also feature the only recordings known to exist of a number of famous singers and conductors who were never recorded commercially . They include legendary tenor Jean de Reszke , soprano Milka Ternina , and conductor Luigi Mancinelli .",

  "/wiki/Piano_roll": "A piano roll is a music storage medium used to operate a player piano , piano player or reproducing piano . Piano rolls , like other Music Rolls , are continuous rolls of paper with perforations ( holes ) punched into them . The perforations represent note control data . The roll moves over a reading system known as a 'tracker bar ' and the playing cycle for each musical note is triggered when a perforation crosses the bar and is read . The majority of piano rolls play on three distinct musical scales . The 65-note ( with a playing range of A1 to C\u266f7 ) format was introduced in 1896 in the USA specifically for piano music . In 1900 an American format playing all 88 notes ( A0 to C8 ) of the standard piano scale was introduced . In 1902 a German 72-note scale ( F1 , G1 to E7 ) was introduced . All of these scales were subject to being operated by piano rolls of varying dimensions . The 1908 Buffalo Convention of US manufacturers standardized the US industry to the 88-note scale and fixed the physical dimensions for that scale . Piano rolls have been in continuous production since 1896 , and are still being manufactured today ; QRS Music offers 45,000 titles with new titles being added on a regular basis , although they are no longer mass-produced . MIDI files have generally supplanted piano rolls in storing and playing back performance data , accomplishing digitally and electronically what piano rolls do mechanically .",

  "/wiki/Rosa_Parks": "Rosa Louise McCauley Parks ( February 4 , 1913 - October 24 , 2005 ) was an American activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott . The United States Congress has called her the first lady of civil rights and the mother of the freedom movement . On December 1 , 1955 , in Montgomery , Alabama , Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake 's order to relinquish her seat in the colored section to a white passenger , after the whites-only section was filled . Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation , but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws . Parks ' prominence in the community and her willingness to become a controversial figure inspired the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year , the first major direct action campaign of the post-war civil rights movement . Her case became bogged down in the state courts , but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle succeeded in November 1956 . Parks ' act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement . She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation . She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders , including Edgar Nixon , president of the local chapter of the NAACP ; and Martin Luther King Jr. , a new minister in Montgomery who gained national prominence in the civil rights movement and went on to win a Nobel Peace Prize . At the time , Parks was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP . She had recently attended the Highlander Folk School , a Tennessee center for training activists for workers ' rights and racial equality . She acted as a private citizen tired of giving in .",
