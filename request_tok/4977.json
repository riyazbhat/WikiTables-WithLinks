There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic era , though there is no direct evidence of when Samarkand was founded ; some theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries B.C . Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean , at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia . By the time of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia , it was the capital of the Sogdian satrapy . The city was taken by Alexander the Great in 329 BC , when it was known by its Greek name of Marakanda ( \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 ) . The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and Turkic rulers until the Mongols under Genghis Khan conquered Samarkand in 1220 . Today , Samarkand is the capital of Samarqand Region and one of the largest cities of Uzbekistan . The city is noted for being an Islamic center for scholarly study . In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of Timur ( Tamerlane ) and is the site of his mausoleum ( the Gur-e Amir ) . The Bibi-Khanym Mosque , rebuilt during the Soviet era , remains one of the city 's most notable landmarks . Samarkand 's Registan square was the ancient centre of the city , and is bound by three monumental religious buildings . The city has carefully preserved the traditions of ancient crafts : embroidery , gold embroidery , silk weaving , engraving on copper , ceramics , carving and painting on wood .",
