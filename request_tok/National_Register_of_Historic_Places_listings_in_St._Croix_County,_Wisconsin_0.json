  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain .

  "/wiki/Log_scaler": "The log scaler is an occupation in the timber industry . The Log Scaler measures the cut trees to determine the scale ( volume ) and quality ( grade ) of the wood to be used for manufacturing . When logs are sold , in order to determine the basis for a sale price in a standard way , the logs are scaled which means they are measured , identified as to species , and deductions for defects assigned to produce a net volume of merchantable wood . There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood . Scribner Decimal C rule is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs . Cubic rule , often called Metric in Canada , determines the cubic volume of the log material . The logs are recorded as gross scale ( actual log measurements , length and diameter ) and net scale ( volume after deductions for defects are taken out ) . This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to scale government timber . Since internal defects are determined by external indications , scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules . The log scaler is subject to random check scales in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared . The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the gross scale and + or - 2% of the net scale to keep their certification to scale . The scale is used for payment , quality control and inventory purposes .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Lutheranism": "Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther , a 16th-century German reformer . Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation . The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings , beginning with the 95 Theses , divided Western Christianity . The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms : the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas , subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property , half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation . The divide centered primarily on two points : the proper source of authority in the church , often called the formal principle of the Reformation , and the doctrine of justification , often called the material principle of Lutheran theology . [ a ] Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone , the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith . This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church , defined at the Council of Trent , concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition . Unlike Calvinism , Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper . Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology , divine grace , the purpose of God 's Law , the concept of perseverance of the saints , and predestination .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms .

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament .

With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Congregationalist": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",
