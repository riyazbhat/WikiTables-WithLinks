  "/wiki/MAME": "MAME ( originally an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator ) is a free and open-source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms . The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten . The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines ; the ability to actually play the games is considered a nice side effect . Joystiq has listed MAME as an application that every Windows and Mac gamer should have . The first public MAME release was by Nicola Salmoria on February 5 , 1997 . The emulator now supports over 7,000 unique games and 10,000 actual ROM image sets , though not all of the supported games are playable . MESS , an emulator for many video game consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core , was integrated upstream into MAME in 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Multi_Emulator_Super_System": "Multi Emulator Super System ( MESS ) was an emulator for various consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core and now a part of MAME . MESS emulates portable and console gaming systems , computer platforms , and calculators . The project strives for accuracy and portability and therefore is not always the fastest emulator for any one particular system . Its accuracy makes it also useful for homebrew game development . As of April 2015 MESS supported 994 unique systems with 2,106 total system variations . However , not all of the systems in MESS are functional ; some are marked as non-working or are in development . MESS was first released in 1998 and has been under constant development since . MAME and MESS were once separate applications , but were later developed and released together from a single source repository . MAMEDEV member David Haywood maintained and distributed UME ( Universal Machine Emulator ) which combined much of the functionality of MAME and MESS in a single application . On May 27 , 2015 , MESS was formally integrated with MAME and became a part of MAME .",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",
  "/wiki/New_BSD": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",
  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

  "/wiki/DOS": "DOS ( /d\u0252s/ , /d\u0254\u02d0s/ ) is a platform-independent acronym for Disk Operating System which later became a common shorthand for disk-based operating systems on IBM PC compatibles . DOS primarily consists of Microsoft 's MS-DOS and a rebranded IBM version under the name PC DOS , both of which were introduced in 1981 . Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include DR DOS ( 1988 ) , ROM-DOS ( 1989 ) , PTS-DOS ( 1993 ) , and FreeDOS ( 1998 ) . MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995 . Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym DOS , beginning with the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966 . Others include Apple DOS , Apple ProDOS , Atari DOS , Commodore DOS , TRSDOS , and AmigaDOS .",

There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

The system combined a MOS 6502 microprocessor , Commodore BASIC in read only memory ( ROM ) , a keyboard , a computer monitor and ( in early models ) a cassette deck for data and program storage in a single all-in-one case . Development of the system began in 1976 and first offered for sale in January 1977 at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) . A series of problems meant that production versions did not begin to arrive until December 1977 , by which time the TRS-80 and Apple II had already begun deliveries . The close release dates of the three machines led Byte to refer to them collectively as the 1977 trinity . The original PET design underwent a series of significant updates , adding more memory , a better keyboard , larger screens and other modifications . The systems were a top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets , as well as European business uses . The PET formed the basis for Commodore 's entire 8-bit product line , including the Commodore 64 .

As a seventh generation console , the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS . Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed . The PSP 's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device , which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles , computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software , other PSP systems , and the Internet . The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format - Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) - as its primary storage medium . The PSP was received positively by critics , and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime . Several models of the console were released , before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita , released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later . The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store , which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31 , 2016 .

  "/wiki/Java_Platform": "Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems , which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation , that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment . Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers . Java applets , which are less common than standalone Java applications , were commonly run in secure , sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages . Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages , including Ada , JavaScript , Python , and Ruby . In addition , several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM , including Clojure , Groovy , and Scala . Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++ , but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap ( while some implementations e.g . all currently supported by Oracle , may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead ) and all variables of object types are references . Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM . On November 13 , 2006 , Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in October 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version ( Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support ) , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java , because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 ( Java 12 is also an non-LTS option ) .",
