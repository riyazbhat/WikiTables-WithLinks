The dynasty was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song following his usurpation of the throne of the Later Zhou , ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous Liao , Western Xia and Jin dynasties to its north . It was eventually conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty . The Song government was the first in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy . This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder , as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass . The Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods : Northern Song and Southern Song . During the Northern Song ( Chinese : \u5317\u5b8b ; 960-1127 ) , the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing ( now Kaifeng ) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China . The Southern Song ( Chinese : \u5357\u5b8b ; 1127-1279 ) refers to the period after the Song lost control of its northern half to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars . During this time , the Song court retreated south of the Yangtze and established its capital at Lin'an ( now Hangzhou ) . Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the Yellow River , the Song economy was still strong , as the Southern Song empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land . The Southern Song dynasty considerably bolstered its naval strength to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct maritime missions abroad",

A much celebrated writer , both among his contemporaries and in subsequent centuries , Ouyang Xiu is considered the central figure of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song . It was he who revived the Classical Prose Movement ( first begun by the two Tang dynasty masters two centuries before him ) and promoted it in imperial examinations , paving the way for future masters like Su Shi and Su Zhe . Ouyang Xiu 's interests as a writer were remarkably diverse . As a historian , he was put in charge by Emperor Renzong of Song of creating the New Book of Tang , which was completed in 1060 . He also wrote in his spare time the Historical Records of the Five Dynasties , the only book in the Twenty-Four Histories to have been written in private by a single author . As a poet , he was a noted writer of both the ci and shi genres . But it was his prose writings like Zuiweng Tingji that won him the greatest acclaim . Treatises from Ouyang 's voluminous oeuvre range from studies of flowers to literary criticism and political commentaries . Politically , Ouyang Xiu was one of the major proponents of the Qingli Reforms of the 1040s . When lead reformer Fan Zhongyan fell from power in 1045 , Ouyang was also demoted to posts away from the capital .

It is a selection of what were judged to be the best poetic and prose pieces from the late Warring States period ( c. 300 BC ) to the early Liang dynasty ( c. AD 500 ) , excluding the Chinese Classics and philosophical texts . The Wen Xuan preserves most of the greatest fu rhapsody and shi poetry pieces from the Qin and Han dynasties , and for much of pre-modern history was one of the primary sources of literary knowledge for educated Chinese . The Wen Xuan was compiled between AD 520 and 530 in the city of Jiankang ( modern Nanjing ) during the Liang dynasty by Xiao Tong , the eldest son of Emperor Wu of Liang , and a group of scholars he had assembled . The Liang dynasty , though short-lived , was a period of intense literary activity , and the ruling Xiao family ensured that eminent writers and scholars were frequently invited to the imperial and provincial courts . As Crown Prince , Xiao Tong received the best classical Chinese education available and began selecting pieces for his new anthology in his early twenties . The Wen Xuan contains 761 separate pieces organized into 37 literary categories , the largest and most well known being Rhapsodies ( fu ) and Lyric Poetry ( shi ) . Study of the Wen Xuan enjoyed immense popularity during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , and its study rivalled that of the Five Classics during that period . The Wen Xuan was required reading for any aspiring scholar and official even into the Song dynasty , as evidenced by the medieval Chinese rhyme Wen Xuan study thoroughly done / Half your licentiate already won ( W\u00e9nxu\u01cen l\u00e0n , xi\u00f9c\u00e1i b\u00e0n \u6587\u9078\u721b\uff0c\u79c0\u624d\u534a ) .

With more than two and a half millennia 's worth of commentary and interpretation , the I Ching is an influential text read throughout the world , providing inspiration to the worlds of religion , philosophy , literature , and art . Originally a divination manual in the Western Zhou period ( 1000-750 BC ) , over the course of the Warring States period and early imperial period ( 500-200 BC ) it was transformed into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the Ten Wings . After becoming part of the Five Classics in the 2nd century BC , the I Ching was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East , and eventually took on an influential role in Western understanding of Eastern thought . The I Ching uses a type of divination called cleromancy , which produces apparently random numbers . Six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a hexagram , which can then be looked up in the I Ching book , arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence . The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching is a matter of centuries ' debate , and many commentators have used the book symbolically , often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by Confucianism , Taoism and Buddhism .

It is a collection of rhetorical prose attributed to figures of ancient China , and served as the foundation of Chinese political philosophy for over 2,000 years . The Book of Documents was the subject of one of China 's oldest literary controversies , between proponents of different versions of the text . The New Text version was preserved from Qin Shi Huang 's burning of books and burying of scholars by scholar Fu Sheng . The longer Old Text version was supposedly discovered in the wall of Confucius ' family estate in Qufu by his descendant Kong Anguo in the late 2nd century BC , lost at the end of the Han dynasty and rediscovered in the 4th century AD . Over time , the Old Text version of the Documents became more widely accepted , until it was established as the imperially sanctioned edition during the early Tang dynasty . This continued until the late 17th century , when the Qing dynasty scholar Yan Ruoqu demonstrated that the additional Old Text chapters not contained in the New Text version were actually fabrications reconstructed in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD . The chapters are grouped into four sections representing different eras : the semi-mythical reign of Yu the Great , and the Xia , Shang and Zhou dynasties . The Zhou section accounts for over half the text . Some of its New Text chapters are among the earliest examples of Chinese prose , recording speeches from the early years of the Zhou dynasty in the late 11th century BC .
