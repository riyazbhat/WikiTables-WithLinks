From before the time of his signing with D.C. United at the age of 14 , Adu was spoken of and treated as the future of United States soccer ; even being referred to as the next Pel\u00e9 . However , he failed to live up to the expectations and , after leaving D.C. United in 2006 , he became a journeyman , playing for fourteen teams in eight countries : the United States , Portugal , Monaco , Greece , Turkey , Brazil , Serbia , and Finland . At D.C. United , Adu broke several records . First , he became the youngest athlete ever to sign a professional contract in the United States , after he was selected by the team in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft on January 16 , 2004 . Three months later , on April 3 , 2004 , he became the youngest player to appear in a Major League Soccer ( MLS ) game when he came on as a substitute in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes , and on April 17 , he became the youngest scorer in MLS history , scoring a goal in a 3-2 loss to the MetroStars .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 .
