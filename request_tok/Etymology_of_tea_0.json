It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of Holland ( Hollandic dialect ) spoken by the largely Dutch settlers ( and then by the native Africans who associated with them ) in the south-west of what is now South Africa , where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century . Hence , it is a daughter language of Dutch . Although Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages , including German and the Khoisan languages , an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin . [ note 1 ] Therefore , differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic-type morphology and grammar of Afrikaans , and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch . There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages - especially in written form . With about 7 million native speakers in South Africa , or 13.5% of the population , it is the third-most-spoken language in the country . Estimates of the total number of Afrikaans speakers range between 15 and 23 million . [ note 2 ] It has the widest geographical and racial distribution of all the 11 official languages of South Africa , and is widely spoken and understood as a second or third language .

  "/wiki/Western_Armenian": "Western Armenian ( Classical spelling : , arevmdahayer\u0113n ) is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian , the other being Eastern Armenian . It is based mainly on the Istanbul Armenian dialect contrary to Eastern Armenian which is mainly based on the Yerevan Armenian dialect . Until the early 20th century , various Western Armenian dialects were also spoken in the Ottoman Empire , especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia . The spoken or dialectal varieties of Western Armenian currently in use include Homshetsi , spoken by the Hemshin peoples ; the dialects of Armenians of Kessab , Latakia and Jisr al-Shughur of Syria , Anjar of Lebanon , and Vak\u0131fl\u0131 , of Turkey ( part of the Sueidia dialect . Forms of the Karin dialect of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia , mostly in Gyumri , Artik , Akhuryan , and around 130 villages in the Shirak province , and by Armenians in Samtskhe-Javakheti province of Georgia ( Akhalkalaki , Akhaltsikhe ) . As mostly a diasporic language , and as a language that is not an official language of any state , Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries . Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian outside Armenia and Georgia at less than one million .",

Linguistically , Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a language isolate in relation to any other known living language . The Basques are indigenous to , and primarily inhabit , the Basque Country . The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% ( 751,500 ) of Basques in all territories . Of these , 93.2% ( 700,300 ) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% ( 51,200 ) are in the French portion . Native speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the three ancient provinces in France . Gipuzkoa , most of Biscay , a few municipalities of \u00c1lava , and the northern area of Navarre formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language . By contrast , most of \u00c1lava , the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish , either because Basque was replaced by Spanish over the centuries , in some areas ( most of \u00c1lava and central Navarre ) , or because it was possibly never spoken there , in other areas ( parts of the Enkarterri and southeastern Navarre ) . In Francoist Spain , Basque language use was affected by the repressive policies . In the Basque Country , Francoist repression was not only political , but also linguistic and cultural . The regime placed legal restrictions on the use of language , which was suppressed from official discourse , education , and publishing , making it illegal to register new-born babies under Basque names , and even requiring tombstone engravings in Basque to be removed . In some provinces , the public use of the language was suppressed , with people fined for speaking Basque .",

It is additionally spoken in parts of Russia ( where it is known as Western Russian [ citation needed ] ) , Poland , and Ukraine by Belarusian minorities in those countries . Before Belarus gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 , the language was only known in English as Byelorussian or Belorussian , transliterating the Russian name , \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a belorusskiy yazyk , or alternatively as White Ruthenian ( /ru\u02d0\u02c8\u03b8i\u02d0ni\u0259n/ ) or White Russian . Following independence , it has acquired the additional name Belarusian . As one of the East Slavic languages , Belarusian shares many grammatical and lexical features with other members of the group . To some extent , Russian , Rusyn , Ukrainian , and Belarusian are all mutually intelligible , effectively forming a dialect continuum . Its predecessor stage is known as Ruthenian ( 14th to 17th centuries ) , in turn descended from Old East Slavic ( 10th to 13th centuries ) . In the first Belarus Census of 1999 , the Belarusian language was declared as a language spoken at home by about 3,686,000 Belarusian citizens ( 36.7% of the population ) . About 6,984,000 ( 85.6% ) of Belarusians declared it their mother tongue . Other sources , such as Ethnologue , put the figure at approximately 2.5 million active speakers . According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009 , 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home , while Belarusian is actively used by only 11.9% of Belarusians .",

Spoken by over 10 million people , it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech is closely related to Slovak , to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree , as well as Polish . Like other Slavic languages , Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order . Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German . The Czech-Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period , and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech-Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period . In the later 18th to mid-19th century , the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival . The main non-standard variety , known as Common Czech , is based on the vernacular of Prague , but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic . The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech , although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak . Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory , comprising ten monophthongs , three diphthongs and 25 consonants ( divided into hard , neutral and soft categories ) . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether . Czech has a raised alveolar trill , which is known to occur as a phoneme in only a few other languages , represented by the grapheme \u0159. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model .",

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist . The main differences in language are between generations , with youth language being particularly innovative .",

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish .

It was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887 , when he published a book detailing the language , Unua Libro ( First Book ) , under the pseudonym Dr. Esperanto . The word esperanto translates into English as one who hopes . Zamenhof 's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding , and to build a community of speakers , as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community . His original title for the language was simply the international language ( lingvo internacia ) , but early speakers grew fond of the name Esperanto and began to use it as the name for the language just two years after its creation ; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since . In 1905 , Zamenhof published Fundamento de Esperanto as a definitive guide to the language . Later that year , he organized the first World Esperanto Congress , an ongoing annual conference , in Boulogne-sur-Mer , France . The first congress ratified the Declaration of Boulogne , which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement ; one of its pronouncements is that Fundamento de Esperanto is the only obligatory authority over the language ; another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it . Zamenhof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of Esperanto , foreshadowing the founding of the Akademio de Esperanto ( in part modeled after the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise ) , which was established soon thereafter . Since 1905 , the congress has been held in a different country every year , with the exceptions of those years during the World Wars . In 1908 , a group of young Esperanto speakers led by the Swiss Hector Hodler established the Universal Esperanto Association in order to provide a central organization for the global Esperanto community . Esperanto grew throughout the 20th century , both as a language and as a linguistic community .",

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders .

Dialectal divergences are observable between the northern and southern forms of Galician-Portuguese in 13th-century texts but the two dialects were similar enough to maintain a high level of cultural unity until the middle of the 14th century , producing the medieval Galician-Portuguese lyric . The divergence has continued to this day , producing the modern languages of Galician and Portuguese . The lexicon of Galician is predominantly of Latin extraction , although it also contains a moderate number of words of Germanic and Celtic origin , among other substrates and adstrates , having also received , mainly via Spanish , a number of nouns from Andalusian Arabic .

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union .

Historically , it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors , although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh itself . [ note 1 ] The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE . Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family . Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken , and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language . Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE , declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt . [ note 2 ] Aramaic and , to a lesser extent , Greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-Jewish commerce and poetry . With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language , becoming the main language of the Yishuv , and subsequently of the State of Israel . According to Ethnologue , in 1998 , Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide . After Israel , the United States has the second-largest Hebrew-speaking population , with about 220,000 fluent speakers , mostly from Israel .",

It is most closely related to Faroese and Western Norwegian . The language is more conservative than most other Western European languages . While most of them have greatly reduced levels of inflection ( particularly noun declension ) , Icelandic retains a four-case synthetic grammar ( comparable to German , though considerably more conservative and synthetic ) and is distinguished by a wide assortment of irregular declensions . Since the written language has not changed much , Icelanders are able to read classic Old Norse literature created in the 10th through 13th centuries ( such as the Eddas and sagas ) with relative ease . Icelandic is closely related to , but not mutually intelligible when spoken with , the Faroese language whereas the written forms of the two languages are very similar . It is not mutually intelligible with the continental Scandinavian languages , and is farther away from the most widely spoken Germanic languages English and German than those three are . Aside from the 300,000 Icelandic speakers in Iceland , it is spoken by about 8,000 people in Denmark , 5,000 people in the United States , and more than 1,400 people in Canada , notably in the region known as New Iceland in Manitoba which was settled by Icelanders beginning in the 1880s .

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved .

This is because northwestern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands were the area of settlement of the Saxons ( Old Saxony ) , while Low German spread to northeastern Germany through eastward migration of Low German speakers into areas with a Slavic-speaking population ( Germania Slavica ) .

Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century .

It is the national language of the country and also serves as an official language of the European Union , the only Semitic language so distinguished . Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic , which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect during the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091 . As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-christianisation of the island , Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation . It is therefore exceptional as a variety of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic . Maltese morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages , namely Italian and Sicilian . The original Arabic base comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary , especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words , but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian ; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary . However , rural dialects of Maltese show more similarities to the original Siculo-Arabic ancestor as compared to Standard Maltese . A 2016 study shows that , in terms of basic everyday language , speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic , which is a Maghrebi Arabic dialect with a significant Latin substratum , whereas speakers of Tunisian Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese .

Today there are two official forms of written Norwegian , Bokm\u00e5l ( literally book tongue ) and Nynorsk ( new Norwegian ) , each with its own variants . Bokm\u00e5l developed from the Dano-Norwegian koin\u00e9 language that evolved under the union of Denmark-Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries , while Nynorsk was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects .

There are over 50 million Polish-language speakers around the world and it is one of the official languages of the European Union . Polish is written with the standardized Polish alphabet , which has nine additions to the letters of the basic Latin script ( \u0105 , \u0107 , \u0119 , \u0142 , \u0144 , \u00f3 , \u015b , \u017a , \u017c ) . Among the major languages , it is most closely related to Slovak and Czech , but differs from other Slavic varieties in terms of pronunciation and general grammar . In addition , Polish was profoundly influenced by Germanic languages , most notably German , and Italic languages like Latin and French , which contributed to a large number of loanwords and similar grammatical structures . Polish currently has the largest number of speakers of the West Slavic group and is also the second most widely spoken Slavic language . Historically , Polish was a lingua franca , important both diplomatically and academically in Central and Eastern Europe . Today , Polish is spoken by over 38.5 million people as their first language in Poland . It is also spoken as a second language in Northern Czech Republic and Slovakia , western parts of Belarus and Ukraine as well as in Central-Eastern Lithuania and Latvia . Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods , most notably after World War II , millions of Polish speakers can be found in countries such as Canada , Argentina , Brazil , Israel , Australia , the United Kingdom and the United States .",
  "/wiki/Scots_language": "Scots ( Scottish Gaelic : Albais ) is the West Germanic languages variety spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster in Ireland ( where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots ) . It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic , the Celtic language that was historically restricted to most of the Highlands , the Hebrides and Galloway after the 16th century . The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity . Scots is recognised as an indigenous language of Scotland , a regional or minority language of Europe , and as a vulnerable language by UNESCO . As there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect , scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic , historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English . Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist , they often render contradictory results . Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum , with Scottish Standard English at the other . Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English , but it has its own distinct dialects . Alternatively , Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language , in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to but distinct from Danish . In the 2011 Scottish Census , 1.5 million people in Scotland reported being able to speak Scots .",
  "/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic": "Scottish Gaelic ( G\u00e0idhlig [ \u02c8ka\u02d0l\u026ak\u02b2 ] ( listen ) , Am Faclair Beag Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : [ 'ga\u02d0l\u026ag\u02b2 ] ) or Scots Gaelic , sometimes also referred to simply as Gaelic , is a Goidelic language of the Celtic and Indo-European language family , native to the Gaels of Scotland . As a Goidelic language , Scottish Gaelic , like Modern Irish and Manx , developed out of Old Irish . It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period , although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century . Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking , as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames . In the 2011 census of Scotland , 57,375 people ( 1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old ) reported as able to speak Gaelic , 1,275 fewer than in 2001 . The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides . Nevertheless , there are revival efforts , and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses . Outside Scotland , a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in eastern Canada since the 18th century . In the 2016 national census , nearly 4,000 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic . Scottish Gaelic is not an official language of the United Kingdom . However , it is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which the British government has ratified , and the Gaelic Language ( Scotland ) Act 2005 established a language-development body , B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig .",

Sinhala is also spoken as the first language by other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka , totalling about four million . Sinhala is written using the Sinhala script , which is one of the Brahmic scripts , a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the Kadamba script . Sinhala is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka . Sinhala , along with Pali , played a major role in the development of Theravada Buddhist literature . The oldest Sinhalese Prakrit inscriptions found are from the third to second century BCE following the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka , the oldest extant literary works date from the ninth century . The closest relative of Sinhala is the Maldivian language . Sinhala has two main varieties - written and spoken , and is a great example of the linguistic phenomenon known as diglossia .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

  "/wiki/Swedish_language": "Swedish ( svenska [ \u02c8sv\u025b\u0302n\u02d0ska ] ( listen ) ) is a North Germanic language spoken natively by 10 million people , predominantly in Sweden ( as the sole official language ) and in parts of Finland , where it has equal legal standing with Finnish . It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish , although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker . Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages , due to the differences in tone , accent and intonation . Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages . Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb ( V ) appears in the second position ( 2 ) of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases - nominative and genitive ( except for pronouns that , as in English , also are inflected in the object form ) - although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive s , then seen as a clitic . Swedish has two grammatical numbers - plural and singular . Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms and are also inflected according to gender , number and definiteness .",

It is the official state language of Ukraine and one of the three official languages in the unrecognized state of Transnistria , the other two being Moldovan and Russian . Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the Cyrillic script ( see Ukrainian alphabet ) . Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the Old East Slavic of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus ' . After the fall of the Kievan Rus ' as well as the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia , the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language . The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century , associated with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate . From 1804 until the Russian Revolution , the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the Russian Empire , of which the biggest part of Ukraine ( Central , Eastern and Southern ) was a part at the time . It has always maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine , where the language was never banned , in its folk songs , itinerant musicians , and prominent authors . The standard Ukrainian language is regulated by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ( NANU ) , particularly by its Institute for the Ukrainian Language , Ukrainian language-information fund , and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies . The Ukrainian language retains a degree of mutual intelligibility with Belarusian and Russian .",

Historically , it has also been known in English as British , Cambrian , Cambric and Cymric . According to the United Kingdom Census 2011 , 19 percent of residents in Wales aged three and over were able to speak Welsh . According to the 2001 Census , 21 percent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh . This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011 - from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively . The Annual Population Survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics for the year ending in March 2019 suggests that 896,900 Welsh residents ( 29 percent ) aged three or over were able to speak Welsh . The results for the most recent National Survey for Wales ( 2017-2018 ) suggest that 19 per cent of the population aged 16 and over were able to speak Welsh , with an additional 12 per cent noting that they had some Welsh speaking ability . The Welsh Language ( Wales ) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales , making it the only language that is de jure official in any part of the United Kingdom , with English being de facto official . The Welsh language , along with English , is also a de jure official language of the National Assembly for Wales ."
