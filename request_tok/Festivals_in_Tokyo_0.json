Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing .
