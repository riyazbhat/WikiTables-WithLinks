  "/wiki/Tau_Ceti": "Tau Ceti , Latinized from \u03c4 Ceti , is a single star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to the Sun , although it has only about 78 % of the Sun 's mass . At a distance of just under 12 light-years ( 3.7 parsecs ) from the Solar System , it is a relatively nearby star and the closest solitary G-class star . The star appears stable , with little stellar variation , and is metal-deficient . Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System . Since December 2012 , there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti , with two of these being potentially in the habitable zone . Because of its debris disk , any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than Earth . Despite this hurdle to habitability , its solar analog ( Sun-like ) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star . Given its stability , similarity and relative proximity to the Sun , Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) and appears in some science fiction literature . It can be seen with the unaided eye with an apparent magnitude of 3.5 . As seen from Tau Ceti , the Sun would be in the northern hemisphere constellation Bo\u00f6tes with an apparent magnitude of about 2.6 . [ nb 2 ]",
  "/wiki/Privateer": "A privateer is a private person or ship that engages in maritime warfare under a commission of war . Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade , until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms . A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions , also referred to as a letter of marque , during wartime . The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war . This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes , and taking prize crews as prisoners for exchange . Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law , with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer 's sponsors , shipowners , captains and crew . A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission ( i.e . the sovereign ) . Privateering allowed sovereigns to raise revenue for war by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to subsidize state power . For participants , privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher . However , this incentive increased the risk of privateers turning to piracy when war ended . The commission usually protected privateers from accusations of piracy but in practice , the historical legality and status of privateers could be vague",

  "/wiki/Short_story": "A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents , with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood . A dictionary definition is an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot . The short story is a crafted form in its own right . Short stories make use of plot , resonance , and other dynamic components as in a novel , but typically to a lesser degree . While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella ( a shorter novel ) , authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques . Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form . They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation . Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years . The short form is , conceivably , more natural to us than longer forms . We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story , and as William Boyd , the award-winning British author and short story writer has said :",

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets .

The original Path of the Fury opens with Alicia DeVries having been in retirement and resettled to the frontier with her extended family , whereas in the new novel she lives at home with her family and progresses from school girl to marine recruit through specialty training and participates with distinction in an interstellar war ; the prequel climaxes by detailing her later war experiences after she joins an elite special forces unit of 'Drop commandos ' where she becomes a bona fide hero several times over . Furthermore , In Fury Born goes back to cover the early career of the protagonist and better organize the universe as a setting for additional series ' works , and is the longer of the two novels - detailing topics of great interest in and of themselves up to and including a climactic event in her military career that caused her to retire young , but with great honors and background material such as the political astrography - then segues seamlessly into the original novel presented in virtually unaltered form , excepting only tweaks to some of the background explanations setting up future sequels . The original novel presents her story after she retires from active military duty and has joined her family in migration to a settlement on the frontiers of the governing empire , with mere mentions of the events detailed in the newly added prequel novel . In Fury Born begins with the rearing and military career of the protagonist while Path of the Fury centers around former elite commando Alicia DeVries 's quest to attain revenge on the interstellar pirates who killed her family . In the early chapters of the original works , she is rescued and becomes allied with the weakened drifting spirit of Tisiphone , one of the Greek mythological Furies , who in compensation moves into one corner of Alicia 's mind and imbues her with some superheroish abilities .

A formulaic oath in the Iliad invokes them as the Erinyes , that under earth take vengeance on men , whosoever hath sworn a false oath . Walter Burkert suggests they are an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath . They correspond to the Dirae in Roman mythology . The Roman writer Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote that they are called Eumenides in hell , Furiae on earth , and Dirae in heaven . According to Hesiod 's Theogony , when the Titan Cronus castrated his father , Uranus , and threw his genitalia into the sea , the Erinyes ( along with the Giants and the Meliae ) emerged from the drops of blood which fell on the earth ( Gaia ) , while Aphrodite was born from the crests of sea foam . According to variant accounts , they emerged from an even more primordial level - from Nyx ( Night ) , or from a union between air and mother earth . Their number is usually left indeterminate . Virgil , probably working from an Alexandrian source , recognized three : Alecto or Alekto ( endless ) , Megaera ( jealous rage ) , and Tisiphone or Tilphousia ( vengeful destruction ) , all of whom appear in the Aeneid .

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers",

The TV show Doctor Who mainly features a single TARDIS used by the central character the Doctor . However , in the series other TARDISes are sometimes seen or used . The Doctor 's TARDIS has a number of features peculiar to it , notably due to its age and personality . While other TARDISes have the ability to change their appearance in order to blend in with their surroundings , the chameleon circuit in the Doctor 's TARDIS is broken , and it always resembles a police box . However , in the new series ( since 2005 ) , a perception filter is used to make the TARDIS blend in with the surroundings , so that it is often ignored by passersby . While the exterior is of limited size , the TARDIS is much bigger on the inside , containing an infinite number of rooms , corridors and storage spaces . Doctor Who has become so much a part of British popular culture that the shape of the police box has become associated with the TARDIS rather than with its real-world inspiration . [ nb 4 ] The name TARDIS is a registered trademark of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . The police box design has also been registered as a trademark by the BBC , despite the design having been created by the Metropolitan Police . The word TARDIS is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary"
