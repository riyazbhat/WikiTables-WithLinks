The cast was filmed living in a SoHo loft from February 16 to May 18 , 1992 , The series premiered May 21 of that year . This is the first of three seasons to be filmed in New York City . In 2001 , the show returned to the city in its tenth season , and again in 2008 for its twenty-first season , set in the borough of Brooklyn . As the first season of one of the first series in what is now considered the reality television genre , The Real World : New York is sometimes credited with pioneering some of the conventions of the genre , including bringing together a group of participants who had not previously met , and the use of confessional interviews with participants to double as the show 's narration ( though in the first season , the confessional interviews were sparse and were not taped in a separate , private room , as would become common later ) . Some , however , have credited an earlier series , the 1991 Dutch TV show Nummer 28 , for these innovations ."
