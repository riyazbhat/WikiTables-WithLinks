  "/wiki/International_System_of_Units": "The International System of Units ( SI , abbreviated from the French ) is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement . It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units , which are the second , metre , kilogram , ampere , kelvin , mole , candela , and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units . The system also specifies names for 22 derived units , such as lumen and watt , for other common physical quantities . The base units are defined in terms of invariant constants of nature , such as the speed of light in vacuum and the charge of the electron , which can be observed and measured with great accuracy . Seven constants are used in various combinations to define the seven base units . Prior to 2019 , artefacts were used instead of some of these constants , the last being the International Prototype of the Kilogram , a cylinder of platinum-iridium . Concern regarding its stability led to a revision of the definition of the base units entirely in terms of constants of nature , which was put into effect on 20 May 2019 . Derived units may be defined in terms of base units or other derived units . They are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities . The SI is intended to be an evolving system ; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves . The most recently named derived unit , the katal , was defined in 1999 . The reliability of the SI depends not only on the precise measurement of standards for the base units in terms of various physical constants of nature , but also on precise definition of those constants .",
  "/wiki/Specific_activity": "Specific activity is the activity per quantity of a radionuclide and is a physical property of that radionuclide . Activity is a quantity related to radioactivity for which the SI unit is the becquerel ( Bq ) , equal to one reciprocal second . The becquerel is defined as the number of radioactive transformations per second that occur in a particular radionuclide . The older , non-SI unit of activity is the Curie ( Ci ) which is transformations per second . Since the probability of radioactive decay for a given radionuclide is a fixed physical quantity ( with some slight exceptions , see changing decay rates ) , the number of decays that occur in a given time of a specific number of atoms of that radionuclide is also a fixed physical quantity ( if there are large enough numbers of atoms to ignore statistical fluctuations ) . Thus , specific activity is defined as the activity per quantity of atoms of a particular radionuclide . It is usually given in units of Bq/g , but another commonly used unit of activity is the curie ( Ci ) allowing the definition of specific activity in Ci/g . The amount of specific activity should not be confused with level of exposure to ionizing radiation and thus the exposure or absorbed dose . The absorbed dose is the quantity important in assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on humans .",
  "/wiki/Becquerel": "The becquerel ( English : /b\u025bk\u0259\u02c8r\u025bl/ ; symbol : Bq ) is the SI derived unit of radioactivity . One becquerel is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second . For practical applications , this is a very small quantity , and SI multiples of the unit are commonly used . The becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel , who shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie in 1903 for their work in discovering radioactivity .",
  "/wiki/Curie_(unit)": "The curie ( symbol Ci ) is a non- SI unit of radioactivity originally defined in 1910 . According to a notice in Nature at the time , it was named in honour of Pierre Curie , but was considered at least by some to be in honour of Marie Curie as well . It was originally defined as the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium ( element ) , but is currently defined as 1 Ci = 3.7 \u00d7 10 10 decays per second after more accurate measurements of the activity of 226 Ra ( which has a specific activity of 3.66 \u00d7 10 10 Bq/g ) . In 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures gave the becquerel ( Bq ) , defined as one nuclear decay per second , official status as the SI unit of activity . Therefore :",
  "/wiki/Rutherford_(unit)": "The rutherford ( symbol Rd ) is a non-SI unit of radioactive decay . It is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one million nuclei decay per second . It is therefore equivalent to one megabecquerel , and one becquerel equals one microrutherford . One rutherford is equivalent to 2.703 \u00d7 10 curie . The unit was introduced in 1946 . It was named after British/New Zealand physicist and Nobel laureate Lord Ernest Rutherford ( Nobel Prize in 1908 ) , who was an early leader in the study of atomic nucleus disintegrations . After the becquerel was introduced in 1975 as the SI unit for activity , the rutherford became obsolete , and it is no longer commonly used .",
  "/wiki/Radiation_exposure": "Radiation exposure is a measure of the ionization of air due to ionizing radiation from photons ; that is , gamma rays and X-rays . It is defined as the electric charge freed by such radiation in a specified volume of air divided by the mass of that air . The SI unit of exposure is the coulomb per kilogram ( C/kg ) , which has largely replaced the roentgen ( R ) . One roentgen equals ; an exposure of one coulomb per kilogram is equivalent to 3876 roentgens . As a measure of radiation damage exposure has been superseded by the concept of absorbed dose which takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material .",
  "/wiki/Coulomb": "The coulomb ( symbol : C ) is the International System of Units ( SI ) unit of electric charge . It is the charge ( symbol : Q or q ) transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second :",
  "/wiki/Kilogram": "The kilogram ( also kilogramme ) is the base unit of mass in the metric system , formally the International System of Units ( SI ) , having the unit symbol kg . It is a widely used measure in science , engineering , and commerce worldwide , and is often simply called a kilo in everyday speech . The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water . This was a simple definition , but difficult to use in practice . By the latest definitions of the unit , however , this relationship still has an accuracy of 30 ppm . In 1799 , the platinum Kilogramme des Archives replaced it as the standard of mass . In 1879 , a cylinder of platinum-iridium , the International Prototype of the Kilogram ( IPK ) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system , and remained so until 20 May 2019 . The kilogram was the last of the SI units to be defined by a physical artefact . The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second and the metre , based on fixed fundamental constants of nature , as approved by the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) on 16 November 2018 . The replacement of the International Prototype Kilogram as primary standard was motivated by evidence accumulated over a long period of time that the mass of the IPK and its replicas had been changing ; the IPK had diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century . This led to several competing efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to warrant replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants . Physical standard masses such as the IPK and its replicas still serve as secondary standards .",
  "/wiki/Roentgen_(unit)": "The roentgen or r\u00f6ntgen ( ) ( symbol R ) is a legacy unit of measurement for the exposure of X-rays and gamma rays , and is defined as the electric charge freed by such radiation in a specified volume of air divided by the mass of that air ( coulomb per kilogram ) . In 1928 , it was adopted as the first international measurement quantity for ionising radiation to be defined for radiation protection , as it was then the most easily replicated method of measuring air ionization by using ion chambers . It is named after the German physicist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen , who discovered X-rays . However , although this was a major step forward in standardising radiation measurement , the roentgen has the disadvantage that it is only a measure of air ionisation , and not a direct measure of radiation absorption in other materials , such as different forms of human tissue . For instance , one roentgen deposits of absorbed dose in dry air , or in soft tissue . One roentgen of X-rays may deposit anywhere from in bone depending on the beam energy . As the science of radiation dosimetry developed , it was realised that the ionising effect , and hence tissue damage , was linked to the energy absorbed , not just radiation exposure . Consequently new radiometric units for radiation protection were defined which took this into account . In 1953 the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements ( ICRU ) recommended the rad , equal to 100 erg/g , as the unit of measure of the new radiation quantity absorbed dose . The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units . In 1975 the unit Gray was named as the SI unit of absorbed dose . One Gray is equal to 1 joule/kg ( i.e .",
  "/wiki/Statcoulomb": "The statcoulomb ( statC ) or franklin ( Fr ) or electrostatic unit of charge ( esu ) is the physical unit for electrical charge used in the esu-cgs ( centimetre-gram-second system of units ) and Gaussian units . It is a derived unit given by It can be converted using The SI unit of charge is the coulomb ( C ) . The conversion between C and statC is : The number is 10 times the value of the speed of light expressed in meters/second or , in other words , the speed of light in centimeters per second .",
  "/wiki/Absorbed_dose": "Absorbed dose is a dose quantity which is the measure of the energy deposited in matter by ionizing radiation per unit mass . Absorbed dose is used in the calculation of dose uptake in living tissue in both radiation protection ( reduction of harmful effects ) , and radiology ( potential beneficial effects for example in cancer treatment ) . It is also used to directly compare the effect of radiation on inanimate matter such as in radiation hardening . The SI unit of measure is the gray ( Gy ) , which is defined as one Joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter . The older , non-SI CGS unit rad , is sometimes also used , predominantly in the USA .",
  "/wiki/Gray_(unit)": "The gray ( symbol : Gy ) is a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units ( SI ) . It is defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter . It is used as a unit of the radiation quantity absorbed dose that measures the energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a unit mass of matter being irradiated , and is used for measuring the delivered dose of ionising radiation in applications such as radiotherapy , food irradiation and radiation sterilization and predicting likely acute effects , such as acute radiation syndrome in radiological protection . As a measure of low levels of absorbed dose , it also forms the basis for the calculation of the radiation protection unit the sievert , which is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body . The gray is also used in radiation metrology as a unit of the radiation quantity kerma ; defined as the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged ionizing radiation [ a ] in a sample of matter per unit mass . The gray is an important unit in ionising radiation measurement and was named after British physicist Louis Harold Gray , a pioneer in the measurement of X-ray and radium radiation and their effects on living tissue . The gray was adopted as part of the International System of Units in 1975 . The corresponding cgs unit to the gray is the rad ( equivalent to 0.01 Gy ) , which remains common largely in the United States , though strongly discouraged in the style guide for U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology .",
  "/wiki/Joule": "The joule ( /d\u0292a\u028al , d\u0292u\u02d0l/ jawl , jool ; symbol : J ) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units . It is equal to the energy transferred to ( or work done on ) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force 's motion through a distance of one metre ( 1 newton metre or N\u22c5m ) . It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second . It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule ( 1818-1889 ) . In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units , a joule is defined below , where kg is the kilogram , m is the metre , s is the second , N is the newton , Pa is the pascal , W is the watt , C is the coulomb , and V is the volt :",
  "/wiki/Erg": "The erg is a unit of energy equal to 10 joules . It originated in the centimetre-gram-second ( CGS ) system of units . It has the symbol erg . The erg is not an SI unit . Its name is derived from ( ) , a Greek word meaning 'work ' or 'task ' . An erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimetre . In the CGS base units , it is equal to one gram centimetre-squared per second-squared ( g\u22c5cm/s ) . It is thus equal to 10 joules or 100 nanojoules ( nJ ) in SI units . An erg is approximately the amount of work done ( or energy consumed ) by one common house fly performing one push up , the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up .",
  "/wiki/Rad_(unit)": "The rad is a unit of absorbed radiation dose , defined as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg . It was originally defined in CGS units in 1953 as the dose causing 100 ergs of energy to be absorbed by one gram of matter . The material absorbing the radiation can be human tissue or silicon microchips or any other medium ( for example , air , water , lead shielding , etc. ) . It has been replaced by the gray ( Gy ) in SI derived units but is still used in the United States , though strongly discouraged in chapter 5.2 of style guide for U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology authors . A related unit , the roentgen , is used to quantify the radiation exposure . The F-factor can be used to convert between rad and roentgens .",
  "/wiki/Equivalent_dose": "Equivalent dose is a dose quantity H representing the stochastic health effects of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body which represents the probability of radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage . It is derived from the physical quantity absorbed dose , but also takes into account the biological effectiveness of the radiation , which is dependent on the radiation type and energy . In the SI system of units , the unit of measure is the sievert ( Sv ) .",
  "/wiki/Sievert": "The sievert ( symbol : Sv ) is a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body . The sievert is important in dosimetry and radiation protection , and is named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert , a Swedish medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation . The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose , which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body , and committed dose which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances . The sievert is intended to represent the stochastic health risk , which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage . One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the linear no-threshold model . To enable consideration of stochastic health risk , calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent dose and effective dose , the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context . For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP ) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements ( ICRU ) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these . These are under continual review , and changes are advised in the formal Reports of those bodies . Conventionally , the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects , which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen , such as acute radiation syndrome ; these effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray ( Gy ) . One sievert equals 100 rem . The rem is an older , non-SI unit of measurement .",
  "/wiki/Roentgen_equivalent_man": "The roentgen equivalent man ( or rem ) is an older , CGS unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and committed dose which are measures of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body . Quantities measured in rem are designed to represent the stochastic biological risk of ionizing radiation ; primarily radiation-induced cancer . These quantities are derived from absorbed dose , which in the CGS system has the unit rad which is also an older unit . There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem ; the conversion depends on relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) . The rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01 sievert , which is the more commonly used SI unit outside the United States . A number of earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the roentgen unit , which was named after Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen , a German scientist who discovered X-rays . The acronym is now a misleading historical artifact , since 1 roentgen actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue , when all weighting factors equal unity . Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem . One rem carries with it a 0.05% chance of eventually developing cancer . Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ) , possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated . Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms . The absorbed dose , measured in rad , is the best indicator of ARS ."
