  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/The_Black_Keys": "The Black Keys are an American rock band formed in Akron , Ohio , in 2001 . The group consists of Dan Auerbach ( guitar , vocals ) and Patrick Carney ( drums ) . The duo began as an independent act , recording music in basements and self-producing their records , before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre 's revival in the 2010s . The band 's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach 's blues influences , including Junior Kimbrough , Howlin ' Wolf , and Robert Johnson . Friends since childhood , Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college . After signing with indie label Alive , they released their debut album , The Big Come Up ( 2002 ) , which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records . Over the next decade , the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs , frequent album releases and music festival appearances , and broad licensing of their songs . Their third album , Rubber Factory ( 2004 ) , received critical acclaim and boosted the band 's profile , eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006 . After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios , the duo completed Attack & Release ( 2008 ) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse , who subsequently became a frequent collaborator with the band . The group 's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with Brothers , which along with its popular single Tighten Up , won three Grammy Awards . Their 2011 follow-up El Camino received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart , leading to the first arena concert tour of the band 's career , the El Camino Tour . The album and its hit single Lonely Boy won three Grammy Awards .",
  "/wiki/El_Camino_(The_Black_Keys_album)": "El Camino is the seventh studio album by American rock duo the Black Keys . It was co-produced by Danger Mouse and the group , and was released on Nonesuch Records on December 6 , 2011 . The record was the band 's follow-up to their commercial breakthrough , Brothers ( 2010 ) , and was their third collaboration with Danger Mouse . El Camino draws from popular genres of the 1950s to 1970s , such as rock and roll , glam rock , rockabilly , surf rock and soul . Danger Mouse contributed as a co-writer on each of the 11 songs alongside guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney . The album was recorded from March to May 2011 in Nashville , Tennessee , at Easy Eye Sound Studio , which Auerbach opened the year prior . The band approached writing and recording differently than on previous albums , as they entered the studio without having written any material and deliberated longer on how to structure songs . After struggling to translate the slower songs from Brothers to a live setting , the band wrote more uptempo , hook-laden tracks for El Camino . The album 's cover art depicts a minivan similar to one the group toured in early in their career , but in an inside joke , they named the record after the El Camino muscle car . A faux newspaper advertisement and parody car commercial playing on this joke were used to promote the record prior to release . Lonely Boy was released as the lead single in October 2011 and became the group 's highest-charting single in several countries , including the United States , Australia , and Canada . The album received positive reviews from critics and was ranked by many publications as one of the year 's best albums .",

Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler , the Creator , vocalist/songwriter Andr\u00e9 3000 , and guitarist John Mayer .

Vocally , Ocean uses a free-form flow as well as alternating falsetto and tenor registers throughout the album . His songwriting explores themes of unrequited love , decadence , class , and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery , conversational devices , and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters . He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme-color synesthesia and the color he perceived during the summer he first fell in love . To prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet , Ocean and Def Jam released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date . It was promoted with five singles , including Ocean 's highest charting single Thinkin Bout You ( number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 ) and a supporting concert tour in July 2012 .",
