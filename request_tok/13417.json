It was directed by Leila Conners Petersen and Nadia Conners and financed by Adam Lewis and Pierre Andr\u00e9 Senizergues , and distributed by Warner Independent Pictures . Its world premiere was at the 2007 60th Annual Cannes Film Festival ( May 16-27 , 2007 ) and it was released on August 17 , 2007 , in the year in which the Fourth Assessment Report of the United Nations global warming panel IPCC was published and about a year after Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , another film documentary about global warming .",
  "/wiki/Global_warming": "Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system . It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming . Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably . But , more accurately , global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation , while climate change includes both global warming and its effects , such as changes in precipitation . While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming , many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded , It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that , during the 21st century , the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 \u00b0C ( 0.5 to 3.1 \u00b0F ) in a moderate scenario , or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 \u00b0C ( 4.7 to 8.6 \u00b0F ) in an extreme scenario , depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing . The effects of global warming include rising sea levels , regional changes in precipitation , more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves , and expansion of deserts . Ocean acidification is also caused by greenhouse gas emissions and is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature . Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic , which have contributed to the retreat of glaciers , permafrost , and sea ice .",
  "/wiki/Deforestation": "Deforestation , clearance , clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use . Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms , ranches , or urban use . The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests . About 31 % of Earth 's land surface is covered by forests . Deforestation has many causes : trees can be cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel ( sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber ) , while cleared land can be used as pasture for livestock and plantation . Disregard of ascribed value , lax forest management , and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to large-scale deforestation . In many countries , deforestation - both naturally occurring and human-induced - is an ongoing issue . Between 2000 and 2012 , 2.3 million square kilometres ( 890,000 sq mi ) of forests around the world were cut down . As of 2005 , net deforestation rates had ceased to increase in countries with a per capita GDP of at least US $ 4,600 . The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage , biodiversity loss , and aridity . Deforestation causes extinction , changes to climatic conditions , desertification , and displacement of populations , as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record . Deforestation also has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide , increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to global warming .",
  "/wiki/Holocene_extinction": "The Holocene extinction , otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction , is an ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch ( with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene ) as a result of human activity . The included extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals , including mammals , birds , amphibians , reptiles and arthropods . With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests , as well as other areas , the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented , as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction , or no one has yet discovered their extinction . The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates . The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna , starting at the end of the last Ice Age . Megafauna outside of the African continent , which did not evolve alongside humans , proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation , and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth ( many African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene , but - with few exceptions - megafauna of the mainland was largely unaffected until a few hundred years ago ) [ citation needed ] . These extinctions , occurring near the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary , are sometimes referred to as the Quaternary extinction event . The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions as the extinction coincides with human emergence . Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline , certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity , such as the extinction events of New Zealand and Hawaii . Aside from humans , climate change may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions , especially at the end of the Pleistocene . Ecologically , humanity has been noted as an unprecedented global superpredator that consistently preys on the adults of other apex predators , and has worldwide effects on food webs . There have been extinctions of species on every land mass and in every ocean : there are many famous examples within Africa , Asia , Europe , Australia , North and South America , and on smaller islands .",
  "/wiki/Social_responsibility": "Social responsibility is an ethical framework and suggests that an entity , be it an organization or individual , has an obligation to act for the benefit of society at large . [ citation needed ] Social responsibility is a duty every individual has to perform so as to maintain a balance between the economy and the ecosystems . A trade-off may exist between economic development , in the material sense , and the welfare of the society and environment , though this has been challenged by many reports over the past decade. [ when ? ] Social responsibility means sustaining the equilibrium between the two . It pertains not only to business organizations but also to everyone whose any action impacts the environment . It is a concept that aims to ensure secure healthcare for the people living in rural areas and eliminate all barriers like distance , financial condition , etc . This responsibility can be passive , by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts , or active , by performing activities that directly advance social goals . Social responsibility must be intergenerational since the actions of one generation have consequences on those following . Businesses can use ethical decision making to secure their businesses by making decisions that allow for government agencies to minimize their involvement with the corporation . For instance , if a company follows the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) guidelines for emissions on dangerous pollutants and even goes an extra step to get involved in the community and address those concerns that the public might have , they would be less likely to have the EPA investigate them for environmental concerns . A significant element of current thinking about privacy , however , stresses self-regulation rather than market or government mechanisms for protecting personal information . According to some experts , most rules and regulations are formed due to public outcry , which threatens profit maximization and therefore the well-being of the shareholder , and that if there is not an outcry there often will be limited regulation .",
  "/wiki/Conservation_movement": "The conservation movement , also known as nature conservation , is a political , environmental , and social movement that seeks to protect natural resources including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future . Evidence-based conservation seeks to use high quality scientific evidence to make conservation efforts more effective . The early conservation movement included fisheries and wildlife management , water , soil conservation , and sustainable forestry . The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement 's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include preservation of biodiversity . Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching environmental movement , while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice . Chiefly in the United States , conservation is seen as differing from environmentalism in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued sustainable use by humans . Outside the U.S. the term conservation more broadly includes environmentalism .",

  "/wiki/Seal_hunting": "Seal hunting , or sealing , is the personal or commercial hunting of seals . Seal hunting is currently practiced in ten countries : United States ( above the Arctic Circle in Alaska ) , Canada , Namibia , Denmark ( in self-governing Greenland only ) , Iceland , Norway , Russia , Finland and Sweden . Most of the world 's seal hunting takes place in Canada and Greenland . The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans ( DFO ) regulates the seal hunt in Canada . It sets quotas ( total allowable catch - TAC ) , monitors the hunt , studies the seal population , works with the Canadian Sealers ' Association to train sealers on new regulations , and promotes sealing through its website and spokespeople . The DFO set harvest quotas of over 90,000 seals in 2007 ; 275,000 in 2008 ; 280,000 in 2009 ; and 330,000 in 2010 . The actual kills in recent years have been less than the quotas : 82,800 in 2007 ; 217,800 in 2008 ; 72,400 in 2009 ; and 67,000 in 2010 . In 2007 , Norway claimed that 29,000 harp seals were killed , Russia claimed that 5,479 seals were killed and Greenland claimed that 90,000 seals were killed in their respective seal hunts . Harp seal populations in the northwest Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s as a result of Canada 's annual kill rates , which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970 . Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal . In 1971 , the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system . The system was competitive , with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed , which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year 's quota had been reached .",

Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Generating electricity from fusion power remains at the focus of international research . This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation . Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,563 terawatt hours ( TWh ) of electricity in 2018 , equivalent to about 10 % of global electricity generation , and was the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity .

It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven - the maximum severity - on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan . The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor , which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union . The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power - there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back-up generators reach full power . This operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat . Three such tests had been conducted since 1982 , but they had failed to provide a solution . On this fourth attempt , the test was delayed by 10 hours , so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it . During a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test , the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level at one moment . The operators were able to partially restore power , but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition . The risks were not made evident in the operating instructions , despite a similar accident occurring years before , and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed . Upon test completion , the operators triggered a reactor shutdown , but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead .",

About 40 million tonnes are produced per year . PVC comes in two basic forms : rigid ( sometimes abbreviated as RPVC ) and flexible . The rigid form of PVC is used in construction for pipe and in profile applications such as doors and windows . It is also used in making bottles , non-food packaging , food-covering sheets , and cards ( such as bank or membership cards ) . It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of plasticizers , the most widely used being phthalates . In this form , it is also used in plumbing , electrical cable insulation , imitation leather , flooring , signage , phonograph records , inflatable products , and many applications where it replaces rubber . With cotton or linen , it is used to make canvas . Pure polyvinyl chloride is a white , brittle solid . It is insoluble in alcohol but slightly soluble in tetrahydrofuran .",
  "/wiki/Burning_the_Future:_Coal_in_America": "Burning the Future : Coal in America is a 2008 documentary film produced and directed by David Novack . The film focuses on the impacts of mountaintop mining in the Appalachians , where mountain ridges are scraped away by heavy machinery to access coal seams below , a process that is cheaper and faster than traditional mining methods but is damaging to the environment . Some environmental problems discussed in the film include disfigured mountain ranges , extinct plant and animal species , toxic groundwater , and increased flooding . The film 's run time is 89 minutes . In 2012 , it was rereleased in a shorter , updated version , that was created for public broadcast on PBS . This new version of the films run time is 56 minutes .

  "/wiki/Mountaintop_removal_mining": "Mountaintop removal mining ( MTR ) , also known as mountaintop mining ( MTM ) , is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain . Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land , or overburden , above the seams . This method of coal mining is conducted in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States . Explosives are used to remove up to 400 vertical feet ( 120 m ) of mountain to expose underlying coal seams . Excess rock and soil is dumped into nearby valleys , in what are called holler fills ( hollow fills ) or valley fills . Less expensive to execute and requiring fewer employees , mountaintop removal mining began in Appalachia in the 1970s as an extension of conventional strip mining techniques . It is primarily occurring in Kentucky , West Virginia , Virginia , and Tennessee . The practice of mountaintop removal mining has been controversial . The coal industry cites economic benefits and claims that mountaintop removal is safer than underground mining . [ citation needed ] Published scientific studies have found that mountaintop mining has serious environmental impacts that mitigation practices can not successfully address . [ citation needed ] A high potential for human health impacts has also been reported .",

  "/wiki/Forests": "A forest is a large area dominated by trees . Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world , incorporating factors such as tree density , tree height , land use , legal standing and ecological function . According to the widely used Food and Agriculture Organization definition , forests covered 4 billion hectares ( 9.9\u00d7109 acres ) ( 15 million square miles ) or approximately 30 percent of the world 's land area in 2006 . Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth , and are distributed around the globe . Forests account for 75 % of the gross primary production of the Earth 's biosphere , and contain 80 % of the Earth 's plant biomass . Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests , 8.1 for temperate forests , and 2.6 for boreal forests . Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones : boreal forests around the poles , tropical forests around the Equator , and temperate forests at the middle latitudes . Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes , and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition . Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways . Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions . Forests can also affect people 's health . Human activities , including harvesting forest resources , can negatively affect forest ecosystems .",

  "/wiki/Deforestation_in_Indonesia": "Deforestation in Indonesia involves the long-term loss of forests and foliage across much of the country ; it has had massive environmental and social impacts . Indonesia is home to some of the most biologically diverse forests in the world and ranks third in number of species behind Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo . As late as 1900 , Indonesia was still a densely forested country : forests represented 84 percent of the total land area . Deforestation intensified in the 1970s and has accelerated further since then . The estimated forest cover of 170 million hectares around 1900 decreased to less than 100 million hectares by the end of the 20th century . In 2008 , it was estimated that tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in a decade . Of the total logging in Indonesia , up to 80 % is reported to be performed illegally . Large areas of forest in Indonesia have been cleared by large multinational pulp companies , such as Asia Pulp and Paper , and replaced by plantations . Forests are often burned by farmers and plantation owners . Another major source of deforestation is the logging industry , driven by demand from China and Japan . Agricultural development and transmigration programs moved large populations into rainforest areas , further increasing deforestation rates . Logging and the burning of forests to clear land for cultivation has made Indonesia the world 's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind China and the United States .",

  "/wiki/Clearcutting": "Clearcutting , clearfelling or clearcut logging is a forestry/logging practice in which most or all trees in an area are uniformly cut down . Along with shelterwood and seed tree harvests , it is used by foresters to create certain types of forest ecosystems and to promote select species that require an abundance of sunlight or grow in large , even-age stands . Logging companies and forest-worker unions in some countries support the practice for scientific , safety and economic reasons , while detractors consider it a form of deforestation that destroys natural habitats and contributes to climate change . Clearcutting is the most common and economically profitable method of logging . However , it also creates detrimental side effects , such as the loss of topsoil , the costs of which are intensely debated by economic , environmental and other interests . In addition to the purpose of harvesting wood , clearcutting is used to create land for farming . The human demand for wood and arable land through unsustainable logging regimes like clearcutting has led to the loss of over half of the world 's rainforests . While deforestation of both temperate and tropical rainforests through clearcutting has received considerable media attention in recent years , the other large forests of the world , such as the taiga , also known as boreal forests , are also under threat of rapid development . In Russia , North America and Scandinavia , creating protected areas and granting long-term leases to tend and regenerate trees - thus maximizing future harvests - are among the means used to limit the harmful effects of clearcutting . Long-term studies of clearcut forests , such as studies of the Pasoh Rainforest in Malaysia , are also important in providing insights into the preservation of forest resources worldwide .",

Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem . Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are considered naturalized . The process of human-caused introduction is distinguished from biological colonization , in which species spread to new areas through natural ( non-human ) means such as storms and rafting . The impact of introduced species is highly variable . Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem , while other introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact . Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests . They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example . In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown . The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists , governments , farmers , and others .",
  "/wiki/Cane_toad": "The cane toad ( Rhinella marina ) , also known as the giant neotropical toad or marine toad , is a large , terrestrial true toad native to South and mainland Central America , but which has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean , as well as Northern Australia . It is the world 's largest toad . It is a member of the genus Rhinella , which includes many true toad species found throughout Central and South America , but it was formerly assigned to the genus Bufo . The cane toad is a prolific breeder ; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs . Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding : it has a diet , unusual among anurans , of both dead and living matter . Adults average 10-15 cm ( 4-6 in ) in length ; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of 24 cm ( 9.4 in ) . The cane toad is an old species . A fossil toad ( specimen UCMP 41159 ) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America . It was discovered in a floodplain deposit , which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas . The cane toad has poison glands , and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested . Its toxic skin can kill many animals , both wild and domesticated , and cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs . Because of its voracious appetite , the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural pest control .",
