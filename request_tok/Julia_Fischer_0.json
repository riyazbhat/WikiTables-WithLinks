  "/wiki/Johannes_Brahms": "Johannes Brahms ( German : [ jo\u02c8han\u0259s \u02c8b\u0281a\u02d0ms ] ; 7 May 1833 - 3 April 1897 ) was a German composer , pianist , and conductor of the Romantic period . Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family , Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna . His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs of music , a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von B\u00fclow . Brahms composed for symphony orchestra , chamber ensembles , piano , organ , and voice and chorus . A virtuoso pianist , he premiered many of his own works . He worked with some of the leading performers of his time , including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim ( the three were close friends ) . Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire . An uncompromising perfectionist , Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished . Brahms has been considered , by his contemporaries and by later writers , as both a traditionalist and an innovator . His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters . While many contemporaries found his music too academic , his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar . The diligent , highly constructed nature of Brahms 's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers .",
  "/wiki/Piano_Quartet_No._1_(Brahms)": "The Piano Quartet No . 1 in G minor , Op . 25 , was composed by Johannes Brahms between 1856 and 1861 . It was premiered in 1861 in Hamburg , with Clara Schumann at the piano . It was also played in Vienna on 16 November 1862 , with Brahms himself at the piano supported by members of the Hellmesberger Quartet .

  "/wiki/Viola": "The viola ( /vi\u02c8o\u028al\u0259/ vee-OH-l\u0259 , also UK : /va\u026a\u02c8o\u028al\u0259/ vy-OH-l\u0259 , [ a ] Italian : [ \u02c8vj\u0254\u02d0la , vi\u02c8\u0254\u02d0la ] ) is a string instrument that is bowed or played with varying techniques . It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound . Since the 18th century , it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family , between the violin ( which is tuned a perfect fifth above ) and the cello ( which is tuned an octave below ) . The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3 , G3 , D4 , and A4 . In the past , the viola varied in size and style , as did its names . The word viola originates from the Italian language . The Italians often used the term : viola da braccio meaning literally : 'of the arm ' . Brazzo was another Italian word for the viola , which the Germans adopted as Bratsche . The French had their own names : cinquiesme was a small viola , haute contre was a large viola , and taile was a tenor . Today , the French use the term alto , a reference to its range . The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony , up until the eighteenth century , taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line . Music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef .",

Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths : from low to high , C2 , G2 , D3 and A3 , an octave lower than the viola . Music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef , with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher-range passages . Played by a cellist or violoncellist , it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment , as well as numerous concerti . The cello often plays the bass part , both in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra 's string section , where the cello may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses . Figured bass music of the Baroque-era typically assumes a cello , viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ , harpsichord , lute or theorbo . Cellos are found in many other ensembles , from modern Chinese orchestras to cello rock bands .",

  "/wiki/Piano": "The piano is an acoustic , stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 ( the exact year is uncertain ) , in which the strings are struck by felt hammers . It is played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings . The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate soft and loud respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume ( i.e. , loudness ) produced in response to a pianist 's touch or pressure on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack . The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord , a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume ; compared to the harpsichord , the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range . An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame . Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( typically padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible , such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then , while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal , shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord .",
  "/wiki/EMI_Classics": "EMI Classics was a record label founded by EMI in 1990 in order to reduce the need to create country-specific packaging and catalogs for internationally distributed classical music releases . Following the European Commission 's approval of the takeover of EMI Group by Universal Music in September 2012 , EMI Classics was listed for divestment . The label was sold to Warner Music Group , which absorbed EMI Classics into Warner Classics in 2013 . Classical recordings were formerly simultaneously released under combinations of Angel , Seraphim , Odeon , Columbia , His Master 's Voice , and other labels , in part because competitors own these names in various countries . These were moved under the EMI Classics umbrella to avoid the trademark problems . Prior to this , compact discs distributed globally bore the Angel Records recording angel logo that EMI owned globally . Releases created for distribution in specific countries continued to be distributed under the historical names , with the exception of Columbia , since EMI had sold the Columbia name to Sony Music Entertainment . The red logo harkens back to the Red Seal releases , introduced by EMI predecessor the Gramophone Company in 1902 : HMV classical releases were issued with red labels . EMI Classics also included the Virgin Classics label , both of them were formerly managed under The Blue Note Label Group in the U.S. until 2013 . With the sale of EMI to Universal Music Group in 2012 , European regulators forced Universal Music to divest itself of EMI Classics , which was operated with other European EMI assets to be divested as the Parlophone Label Group . In February 2013 , Universal Music sold the Parlophone Label Group , including EMI Classics and Virgin Classics , to Warner Music Group . The European Union approved the deal on May 2013 , and WMG took control of the label on 1 July 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Compact_Disc": "Compact disc ( CD ) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982 . The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ( CD-DA ) but was later adapted for storage of data ( CD-ROM ) . Several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( CD-R ) , rewritable media ( CD-RW ) , Video Compact Disc ( VCD ) , Super Video Compact Disc ( SVCD ) , Photo CD , PictureCD , Compact Disc-Interactive ( CD-i ) , and Enhanced Music CD . The first commercially available audio CD player , the Sony CDP-101 , was released October 1982 in Japan . Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres ( 4.7 in ) and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data . The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres ( 2.4 to 3.1 in ) ; they are sometimes used for CD singles , storing up to 24 minutes of audio , or delivering device drivers . At the time of the technology 's introduction in 1982 , a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard drive , which would typically hold 10 MB . By 2010 , hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs , while their prices had plummeted to commodity level . In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . From the early 2000s , CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak ; however , they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .",

Born in Venice , the capital of the Venetian Republic , he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers , and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe . He composed many instrumental concertos , for the violin and a variety of other instruments , as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas . His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons . Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 , a home for abandoned children . Vivaldi had worked there as a Catholic priest for 1 1/2 years and was employed there from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740 . Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice , Mantua and Vienna . After meeting the Emperor Charles VI , Vivaldi moved to Vienna , hoping for royal support . However , the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi 's arrival , and Vivaldi himself died , in poverty , less than a year later .",
  "/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)": "The Four Seasons ( Italian : Le quattro stagioni ) is a group of four violin concerti by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi , each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year . They were written around 1716-1717 and published in 1725 in Amsterdam , together with eight additional concerti , as Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione ( The Contest Between Harmony and Invention ) . The Four Seasons is the best known of Vivaldi 's works . Though three of the concerti are wholly original , the first , Spring , borrows motifs from a sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi 's contemporaneous opera Il Giustino . The inspiration for the concertos is not the countryside around Mantua , as initially supposed , where Vivaldi was living at the time , since according to Karl Heller they could have been written as early as 1716-1717 , while Vivaldi was engaged with the court of Mantua only in 1718 . They were a revolution in musical conception : in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks , singing birds ( of different species , each specifically characterized ) , a shepherd and his barking dog , buzzing flies , storms , drunken dancers , hunting parties from both the hunters ' and the prey 's point of view , frozen landscapes , and warm winter fires . Unusually for the period , Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying sonnets ( possibly written by the composer himself ) that elucidated what it was in the spirit of each season that his music was intended to evoke . The concerti therefore stand as one of the earliest and most detailed examples of what would come to be called program music - i.e. , music with a narrative element . Vivaldi took great pains to relate his music to the texts of the poems , translating the poetic lines themselves directly into the music on the page . For example , in the middle section of Spring , when the goatherd sleeps , his barking dog can be heard in the viola section . The music is elsewhere similarly evocative of other natural sounds . Vivaldi divided each concerto into three movements ( fast-slow-fast ) , and , likewise , each linked sonnet into three sections .",

As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 , the ballet Romeo and Juliet - from which Dance of the Knights is taken - and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created - excluding juvenilia - seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 , Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev - Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son - which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia . After the Revolution of 1917 , Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky , and resided in the United States , then Germany , then Paris , making his living as a composer , pianist and conductor .",

He served as director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory between 1905 and 1928 and was instrumental in the reorganization of the institute into the Petrograd Conservatory , then the Leningrad Conservatory , following the Bolshevik Revolution . He continued heading the Conservatory until 1930 , though he had left the Soviet Union in 1928 and did not return . The best-known student under his tenure during the early Soviet years was Dmitri Shostakovich . Glazunov was significant in that he successfully reconciled nationalism and cosmopolitanism in Russian music . While he was the direct successor to Balakirev 's nationalism , he tended more towards Borodin 's epic grandeur while absorbing a number of other influences . These included Rimsky-Korsakov 's orchestral virtuosity , Tchaikovsky 's lyricism and Taneyev 's contrapuntal skill .

The violin concerto is quite representative of Glazunov 's technically brilliant style . There are no pauses or numbered sections in the concerto ; it is nevertheless often described as consisting of either three or four movements , which may be variously labeled . The slow second movement is seamlessly inserted by the composer into the middle of the first movement , which is an original and rare structural peculiarity of this composition . The main cadenza at the end of the first movement was composed by Glazunov himself .

After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions .",
  "/wiki/Sonatas_and_partitas_for_solo_violin": "The sonatas and partitas for solo violin ( BWV 1001-1006 ) are a set of six works composed by Johann Sebastian Bach . They are sometimes referred to in English as the sonatas and partias for solo violin in accordance with Bach 's headings in the autograph manuscript : Partia ( plural Partien ) was commonly used in German-speaking regions during Bach 's time , whereas the Italian partita was introduced to this set in the 1879 Bach Gesellschaft edition , having become standard by that time . [ page needed ] The set consists of three sonatas da chiesa in four movements and three partitas ( or partias ) in dance-form movements . The 2nd Partita is widely known for its Chaconne , considered one of the most masterful and expressive works ever written for solo violin . The set was completed by 1720 but was not published until 1802 by Nikolaus Simrock in Bonn . Even after publication , it was largely ignored until the celebrated violinist Joseph Joachim started performing these works . Today , Bach 's Sonatas and Partitas are an essential part of the violin repertoire , and they are frequently performed and recorded . The Sei Solo a Violino senza Basso accompagnato ( Six Solos for Violin Without Bass Accompaniment ) , as Bach titled them , firmly established the technical capability of the violin as a solo instrument . The pieces often served as archetypes for solo violin pieces by later generations of composers , including Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k . Some believe the literal meaning of the title sei solo when read as German rather than Italian words ( Be alone [ imparative ] ) is an intentional reference to the recent sudden death of his wife . This theory is popular among musicians but not among Bach scholars , though the exceptional indication of the year of completion on the title page does seem to indicate a payment of homage to his wife .",

  "/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [ a ] ( 27 January 1756 - 5 December 1791 ) , baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart , [ b ] was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period . Born in Salzburg , Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood . Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty . At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years .",

Traditionally a three-movement work , the violin concerto has been structured in four movements by a number of modern composers , including Dmitri Shostakovich , Igor Stravinsky , and Alban Berg . [ a ] In some violin concertos , especially from the Baroque and modern eras , the violin ( or group of violins ) is accompanied by a chamber ensemble rather than an orchestra - for instance , in Vivaldi 's L'estro armonico , originally scored for four violins , two violas , cello , and continuo , and in Allan Pettersson 's first concerto , for violin and string quartet .",

Mendelssohn 's compositions include symphonies , concertos , piano music and chamber music . His best-known works include his overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the Italian Symphony , the Scottish Symphony , the oratorio Elijah , the overture The Hebrides , his mature Violin Concerto , and his String Octet . The melody for the Christmas carol Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing is also his . Mendelssohn 's Songs Without Words are his most famous solo piano compositions . A grandson of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn , Felix Mendelssohn was born into a prominent Jewish family . He was brought up without religion until the age of seven , when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian . Felix was recognised early as a musical prodigy , but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent . Mendelssohn enjoyed early success in Germany , and revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach , notably with his performance of the St Matthew Passion in 1829 . He became well received in his travels throughout Europe as a composer , conductor and soloist ; his ten visits to Britain - during which many of his major works were premiered - form an important part of his adult career .

The revised version was in a more romantic , Schumannesque style with the piano given a more important role in the trio .

He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood .

  "/wiki/Violin": "The violin , sometimes known as a fiddle , is a wooden string instrument in the violin family . Most violins have a hollow wooden body . It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use . Smaller violin-type instruments exist , including the violino piccolo and the kit violin , but these are virtually unused . The violin typically has four strings , usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3 , D4 , A4 , E5 , and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings , though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers ( pizzicato ) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ( col legno ) . Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres . They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition , both in ensembles ( from chamber music to orchestras ) and as solo instruments and in many varieties of folk music , including country music , bluegrass music and in jazz . Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion , with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound . Further , the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures , including Indian music and Iranian music . The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it . The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy , with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection . In Europe , it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music , such as the viola .",

A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm ( 25 1\u20442 in ) long , with metal keys , a conical bore and a flared bell . Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure , causing it to vibrate with the air column . The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as bright . When the word oboe is used alone , it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family , such as the bass oboe , the cor anglais ( English horn ) , or oboe d'amore . A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist . Today , the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras , concert bands and chamber ensembles .

A sort of dedication can be recognized in Paganini 's own score , where he annotated between 1832 and 1840 the following 'dedicatee ' for each Caprice ( possibly ready for a new printed edition ) : 1 : Henri Vieuxtemps ; 2 : Giuseppe Austri ; 3 : Ernesto Camillo Sivori ; 4 : Ole Bornemann Bull ; 5 : Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst ; 6 : Karol J\u00f3zef Lipi\u0144ski ; 7 : Franz Liszt ; 8 : Delphin Alard ; 9 : Herrmann ; 10 : Theodor Haumann [ it ] ; 11 : Sigismond Thalberg ; 12 : Dhuler ; 13 : Charles Philippe Lafont ; 14 : Jacques Pierre Rode ; 15 : Louis Spohr ; 16 : Rodolphe Kreutzer ; 17 : Alexandre Art\u00f4t ; 18 : Antoine Bohrer ; 19 : Andreas Jakob Romberg ; 20 : Carlo Gignami ; 21 : Antonio Bazzini ; 22 : Luigi Alliani ; 23 : [ no name ] ; 24 : Nicol\u00f2 Paganini , sepolto pur troppo ( to my self , regrettably buried ) . Ferdinand David 's first edition was published by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel in 1854 . David , as editor , also issued an edition of Caprices with piano accompaniments by Robert Schumann .",

His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso ( 1863 ) , the Second Piano Concerto ( 1868 ) , the First Cello Concerto ( 1872 ) , Danse macabre ( 1874 ) , the opera Samson and Delilah ( 1877 ) , the Third Violin Concerto ( 1880 ) , the Third ( Organ ) Symphony ( 1886 ) and The Carnival of the Animals ( 1886 ) . Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a musical prodigy ; he made his concert debut at the age of ten . After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist , first at Saint-Merri , Paris and , from 1858 , La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later , he was a successful freelance pianist and composer , in demand in Europe and the Americas . As a young man , Saint-Sa\u00ebns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day , particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition . He was a scholar of musical history , and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers . This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music ; although there were neoclassical elements in his music , foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death . Saint-Sa\u00ebns held only one teaching post , at the \u00c9cole de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris , and remained there for less than five years . It was nevertheless important in the development of French music : his students included Gabriel Faur\u00e9 , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Sa\u00ebns , whom they revered as a genius .",

His works include operas , ballets , chamber music , secular and religious vocal pieces and orchestral compositions including nine symphonies , written over sixty years . Strongly influenced by Tudor music and English folk-song , his output marked a decisive break in British music from its German-dominated style of the 19th century . Vaughan Williams was born to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a progressive social outlook . Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens , and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody . He wrote many works for amateur and student performance . He was musically a late developer , not finding his true voice until his late thirties ; his studies in 1907-1908 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music and free it from Teutonic influences . Vaughan Williams is among the best-known British symphonists , noted for his very wide range of moods , from stormy and impassioned to tranquil , from mysterious to exuberant . Among the most familiar of his other concert works are Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis ( 1910 ) and The Lark Ascending ( 1914 ) . His vocal works include hymns , folk-song arrangements and large-scale choral pieces . He wrote eight works for stage performance between 1919 and 1951 . Although none of his operas became popular repertoire pieces , his ballet Job : A Masque for Dancing ( 1930 ) was successful and has been frequently staged .",

This version , in which the work is chiefly known , was first performed in 1921 . It is subtitled A Romance , a term that Vaughan Williams favoured for contemplative slow music .

By 1874 , the orchestra had increased in size to 70 musicians , in particular during the leadership of Eus\u00e8be Lucas .

Following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bed\u0159ich Smetana , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia . Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's own style has been described as the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition , absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them . Dvo\u0159\u00e1k displayed his musical gifts at an early age , being an apt violin student from age six . The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and , with special success , in 1873 , when he was aged 31 . Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later . In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition , including scores of two further symphonies and other works . Although Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was not aware of it , Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed . The prize was awarded to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in 1874 [ a ] and again in 1876 and in 1877 , when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick , also a member of the jury , made themselves known to him . Brahms recommended Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to his publisher , Simrock , who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances , Op . 46 . These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878 , the sheet music ( of the original piano 4-hands version ) had excellent sales , and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's international reputation was launched at last .",
  "/wiki/Claude_Debussy": "( Achille ) Claude Debussy [ n 1 ] ( French : [ a\u0283il klod d\u0259bysi ] ; 22 August 1862 - 25 March 1918 ) was a French composer . He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer , although he vigorously rejected the term . He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement , Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France 's leading music college , the Conservatoire de Paris . He originally studied the piano , but found his vocation in innovative composition , despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire 's conservative professors . He took many years to develop his mature style , and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed , Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande . Debussy 's orchestral works include Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune ( 1894 ) , Nocturnes ( 1897-1899 ) and Images ( 1905-1912 ) . His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition . He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his symphonic sketches , La mer ( 1903-1905 ) . His piano works include two books of Pr\u00e9ludes and two of \u00c9tudes . Throughout his career he wrote m\u00e9lodies based on a wide variety of poetry , including his own . He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century .",

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) . His compositions , particularly those of his later period , are notable for their complex textures , rich harmonies and orchestration , and the elaborate use of leitmotifs - musical phrases associated with individual characters , places , ideas , or plot elements . His advances in musical language , such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres , greatly influenced the development of classical music . His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music . Wagner had his own opera house built , the Bayreuth Festspielhaus , which embodied many novel design features . The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival , run by his descendants . His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again , and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works , including Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg ( The Mastersingers of Nuremberg ) . Until his final years , Wagner 's life was characterised by political exile , turbulent love affairs , poverty and repeated flight from his creditors .",
