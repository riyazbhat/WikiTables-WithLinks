  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",

In 1980 , he ran an independent campaign for president , receiving 6.6% of the popular vote . Born in Rockford , Illinois , Anderson practiced law after serving in the Army during World War II . After a stint in the United States Foreign Service , he won election as the State 's Attorney for Winnebago County , Illinois . He won election to the House of Representatives in 1960 in a strongly Republican district . Initially one of the most conservative members of the House , Anderson 's views moderated during the 1960s , particularly regarding social issues . He became Chairman of the House Republican Conference in 1969 and remained in that position until 1979 . He strongly criticized the Vietnam War as well as President Richard Nixon 's actions during the Watergate scandal . Anderson entered the 1980 Republican presidential primaries , introducing his signature campaign proposal of raising the gas tax while cutting social security taxes . He established himself as a contender for the nomination in the early primaries , but eventually dropped out of the Republican race , choosing to pursue an independent campaign for president . In the election , he finished third behind Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and Democratic President Jimmy Carter .",
  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

It has the fifth largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sixth largest population , and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states . Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",
  "/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1980 United States presidential election was the 49th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 1980 . Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan 's victory , some historians consider the election to be a realigning election that marked the start of the Reagan Era . Carter 's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy , a younger brother of former President John F. Kennedy . Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the Democratic primaries , but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention . The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan , who had previously served as the Governor of California , former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas , Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois , and several other candidates . All of Reagan 's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries , and the 1980 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush . Anderson entered the race as an independent candidate , and convinced former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey , a Democrat , to serve as his running mate . Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending , implementation of supply-side economic policies , and a balanced budget . His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter , the Iran hostage crisis , and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation . Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist and warned that Reagan would cut Medicare and Social Security .",

  "/wiki/Mathematics": "Mathematics ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma , knowledge , study , learning ) includes the study of such topics as quantity ( number theory ) , structure ( algebra ) , space ( geometry ) , and change ( mathematical analysis ) . It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences . Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines , such as statistics and game theory .",

  "/wiki/Kakeya_needle_problem": "In mathematics , a Kakeya set , or Besicovitch set , is a set of points in Euclidean space which contains a unit line segment in every direction . For instance , a disk of radius 1/2 in the Euclidean plane , or a ball of radius 1/2 in three-dimensional space , forms a Kakeya set . Much of the research in this area has studied the problem of how small such sets can be . Besicovitch showed that there are Besicovitch sets of measure zero . A Kakeya needle set ( sometimes also known as a Kakeya set ) is a ( Besicovitch ) set in the plane with a stronger property , that a unit line segment can be rotated continuously through 180 degrees within it , returning to its original position with reversed orientation . Again , the disk of radius 1/2 is an example of a Kakeya needle set .",
  "/wiki/Hausdorff-Besicovitch_dimension": "In mathematics , Hausdorff dimension ( a.k.a . fractal dimension ) is a measure of roughness and/or chaos that was first introduced in 1918 by mathematician Felix Hausdorff . Applying the mathematical formula , the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero , of a line segment is 1 , of a square is 2 , and of a cube is 3 . That is , for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners - the shapes of traditional geometry and science - the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the usual sense of dimension , also known as the topological dimension . However , formulas have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects , where , based solely on their properties of scaling and self-similarity , one is led to the conclusion that particular objects - including fractals - have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions . Because of the significant technical advances made by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular or rough sets , this dimension is also commonly referred to as the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension . The Hausdorff dimension , more specifically , is a further dimensional number associated with a given set , where the distances between all members of that set are defined . Such a set is termed a metric space . The dimension is drawn from the extended real numbers , R \u00af { \\displaystyle { \\overline { \\mathbb { R } } } } , as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension , which is not associated to general metric spaces , and only takes values in the non-negative integers . In mathematical terms , the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space . That is , the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero , of a line is one , etc. , and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions . For instance , the Koch snowflake shown at right is constructed from an equilateral triangle ; in each iteration , its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length , the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward , and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4 .",

Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places , areas where tectonic plates are moving apart at spreading centers , ocean basins , and hotspots . Hydrothermal deposits are rocks and mineral ore deposits formed by the action of hydrothermal vents . Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust . Under the sea , hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers or white smokers . Relative to the majority of the deep sea , the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive , often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids . Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea form the base of the food chain , supporting diverse organisms , including giant tube worms , clams , limpets and shrimp .

  "/wiki/Origin_of_life": "Abiogenesis , or informally the origin of life , [ a ] is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter , such as simple organic compounds . While the details of this process are still unknown , the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event , but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication , self-assembly , autocatalysis , and the emergence of cell membranes . Although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists , its possible mechanisms are poorly understood . There are several principles and hypotheses for how abiogenesis could have occurred . Researchers study abiogenesis through a combination of molecular biology , paleontology , astrobiology , oceanography , biophysics , geochemistry and biochemistry , and aim to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life . The study of abiogenesis can be geophysical , chemical , or biological , with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three , as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today . Life functions through the specialized chemistry of carbon and water and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals : lipids ( fatty cell walls ) , carbohydrates ( sugars , cellulose ) , amino acids ( protein metabolism ) , and nucleic acids ( self-replicating DNA and RNA ) . Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules . Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules , or their components , came into existence . Researchers generally think that current life descends from an RNA world , although other self-replicating molecules may have preceded RNA . The classic 1952 Miller-Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids , the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms , can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth . Scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions , including lightning and radiation .",

  "/wiki/Marine_biology": "Marine biology is the scientific study of marine life , organisms in the sea . Given that in biology many phyla , families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land , marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy . A large proportion of all life on Earth lives in the ocean . The exact size of this large proportion is unknown , since many ocean species are still to be discovered . The ocean is a complex three-dimensional world covering approximately 71% of the Earth 's surface . The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere , to the depths of the oceanic trenches , sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean . Specific habitats include coral reefs , kelp forests , seagrass meadows , the surrounds of seamounts and thermal vents , tidepools , muddy , sandy and rocky bottoms , and the open ocean ( pelagic ) zone , where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary . The organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton to huge cetaceans ( whales ) 25-32 meters ( 82-105 feet ) in length . Marine ecology is the study of how marine organisms interact with each other and the environment . Marine life is a vast resource , providing food , medicine , and raw materials , in addition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world . At a fundamental level , marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet . Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle , and are involved in the regulation of the Earth 's climate .",
  "/wiki/Environmentalism": "Environmentalism or environmental rights is a broad philosophy , ideology , and social movement regarding concerns for environmental protection and improvement of the health of the environment , particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the impact of changes to the environment on humans , animals , plants and non-living matter . While environmentalism focuses more on the environmental and nature-related aspects of green ideology and politics , ecology combines the ideology of social ecology and environmentalism . Environmentalism advocates the preservation , restoration and improvement of the natural environment and critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate , and may be referred to as a movement to control pollution or protect plant and animal diversity . For this reason , concepts such as a land ethic , environmental ethics , biodiversity , ecology , and the biophilia hypothesis figure predominantly . At its crux , environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of sustainability . The exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice . Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the colour green , but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as greenwashing . Environmentalism is opposed by anti-environmentalism , which says that the Earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain , and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to climate change or opposing human advancement .",

The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
