The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I .

  "/wiki/Clinical_psychology": "Clinical psychology is an integration of science , theory , and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding , preventing , and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development . Central to its practice are psychological assessment , clinical formulation , and psychotherapy , although clinical psychologists also engage in research , teaching , consultation , forensic testimony , and program development and administration . In many countries , clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession . The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer . In the first half of the 20th century , clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment , with little attention given to treatment . This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians . Since that time , three main educational models have developed in the USA - the Ph.D. Clinical Science model ( heavily focused on research ) , the Ph.D. science-practitioner model ( integrating scientific research and practice ) , and the Psy.D . practitioner-scholar model ( focusing on clinical theory and practice ) . In the UK and the Republic of Ireland , the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models , whilst in much of mainland Europe , the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic . Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy , and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations - psychodynamic , humanistic , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , and systems or family therapy .",
  "/wiki/Dentistry": "Dentistry , also known as dental medicine and oral medicine , is a branch of medicine that consists of the study , diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of diseases , disorders , and conditions of the oral cavity , commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa , and of adjacent and related structures and tissues , particularly in the maxillofacial ( jaw and facial ) area . Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public , the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting , muscular , lymphatic , nervous , vascular , and anatomical structures . Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology ( the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases ) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. [ where ? ] Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team , which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries ( dental assistants , dental hygienists , dental technicians , as well as dental therapists ) . Most dentists either work in private practices ( primary care ) , dental hospitals or ( secondary care ) institutions ( prisons , armed forces bases , etc. ) . The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC . Remains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization ( c. 3300 BC ) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years . It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from medicine . The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific evidence to guide decision-making .",
