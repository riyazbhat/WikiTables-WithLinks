  "/wiki/Interstate_25": "Interstate 25 ( I-25 ) is a major interstate highway in the western United States . It is primarily a north-south highway , serving as the main route through New Mexico , Colorado , and Wyoming . I-25 stretches from Interstate 10 at Las Cruces , New Mexico ( approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of El Paso , Texas ) , to Interstate 90 in Buffalo , Wyoming ( approximately 60 miles ( 97 km ) south of the Montana-Wyoming border ) . It passes through or near Albuquerque , New Mexico ; Colorado Springs , Colorado ; Denver , Colorado ; and Cheyenne , Wyoming . The I-25 corridor is mainly rural , especially in Wyoming , excluding the Albuquerque , Pueblo , Colorado Springs , and Denver areas . The part of I-25 in Colorado passes just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains . That stretch was involved in a large-scale renovation named the Transportation Expansion Project ( TRansportation EXpansion ) in Denver , and the COSMIX ( Colorado Springs Metropolitan Interstate Expansion ) . These projects and others in New Mexico were necessary because these stretches of I-25 were originally inadequately designed and constructed ( the pavement was deteriorating rapidly ) , and also because urban areas like Albuquerque , Colorado Springs , and Denver had tripled and quadrupled in population much earlier than anyone had anticipated back in the 1950s and 1960s . Major highway work for the T-REX project ended on August 22 , 2006 . The COSMIX project was completed in December 2007 . Several other smaller improvement projects for I-25 are still ongoing within New Mexico and Colorado .",
