  "/wiki/Bembridge": "Bembridge is a village and civil parish located on the easternmost point of the Isle of Wight . It had a population of 3,848 according to the 2001 census of the United Kingdom , leading to the implausible claim by some residents that Bembridge is the largest village in England . Bembridge is home to many of the Island 's wealthiest residents . The population had reduced to 3,688 at the 2011 Census . Bembridge sits at the extreme eastern point of the Isle of Wight . Prior to land reclamation the area of Bembridge and Yaverland was almost an island , separated from the remainder of the Isle of Wight by Brading Haven . On the Joan Blaeu map of 1665 , Bembridge is shown as Binbridge I\u017fle , nearly separated from the rest of Wight by River Yar . Prior to the Victorian era Bembridge was a collection of wooden huts and farmhouses , which only consolidated into a true village with the building of the church in 1827 ( later rebuilt in 1846 ) .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Pluto": "Operation Pluto ( Pipe-Lines Under the Ocean ) was a Second World War operation by British engineers , oil companies , and the British Armed Forces to construct undersea oil pipelines under the English Channel between England and France in support of Operation Overlord , the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 . According to the Official History , PLUTO originally stood for 'Pipe-Line Underwater Transportation of Oil ' . The scheme was developed by Arthur Hartley , chief engineer with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . Allied forces on the European continent required a tremendous amount of fuel . Pipelines were considered necessary to relieve dependence on oil tankers , which could be slowed by bad weather , were vulnerable to German submarines , and were also needed in the Pacific War . Geoffrey William Lloyd , the Secretary for Petroleum , in 1942 met Admiral Mountbatten , Chief of Combined Operations , whose area this was , and then the Chairman of Anglo-Iranian . Hartley 's idea of using adapted submarine telephone cable was adopted . The battle of Normandy was won without a drop of fuel being delivered via the Pluto cross-channel pipelines . Only eight per cent of the fuel delivered to the Allied forces in North-West Europe between D-Day and VE Day was via those pipelines ; the rest being by tanker , either in bulk or in cans , or by airlift .",

  "/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty": "The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty , commonly known as the National Trust , is an independent charity and membership organisation for environmental and heritage conservation in England , Wales and Northern Ireland . The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure . The National Trust has been the beneficiary of many large donations and bequests . It owns over 500 heritage properties , which include many historic houses and gardens , industrial monuments , and social history sites . Most of these are open to the public , usually for a charge . Others are leased to tenants on terms that manage to preserve their character whilst providing for more limited public access . The Trust is one of the largest private landowners in the United Kingdom , owning over 248,000 hectares ( 610,000 acres ; 2,480 km2 ; 960 sq mi ) of land .",

Within its portfolio are Stonehenge , Dover Castle , Tintagel Castle and the best preserved parts of Hadrian 's Wall . English Heritage also manages the London Blue Plaque scheme , which links influential historical figures to particular buildings . When originally formed in 1983 , English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government , officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England , that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties . It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection . In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record , bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England 's historic environment . On 1 April 2015 , English Heritage was divided into two parts : Historic England , which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation , and the new English Heritage Trust , a charity that would operate the historic properties , and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo .

  "/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_castle": "A motte and bailey castle is a fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised area of ground called a motte , accompanied by an enclosed courtyard , or bailey , surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade . Relatively easy to build with unskilled labour , but still militarily formidable , these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards , spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France , into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century . The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066 . Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland , Ireland , the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries . Windsor Castle , in England , is an example of a motte-and-bailey castle . By the end of the 13th century , the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification , but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries .",
  "/wiki/Charles_I_of_England": "Charles I ( 19 November 1600 - 30 January 1649 ) [ a ] was King of England , King of Scotland , and King of Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649 . Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 ( as James I ) , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War .",

She also produced sensitive portraits of women and children . After establishing herself first among Calcutta 's Anglo-Indian upper-class and then among London 's cultural elite , Cameron formed her own salon frequented by distinguished Victorians at the seaside village of Freshwater , Isle of Wight . After showing a keen interest in photography for many years , Cameron took up the practice at the relatively late age of 48 , after her daughter gave her a camera as a present . She quickly produced a large body of work capturing the genius , beauty , and innocence of the men , women , and children who visited her studio at Freshwater , and created unique allegorical images inspired by tableaux vivants , theatre , 15th-century Italian painters , and the work of her creative contemporaries . Her photography career was short but productive ; she made around 900 photographs over a 12-year period . Cameron 's work was contentious in her own time . Critics lambasted her softly focused and unrefined images , and considered her illustrative photographs amateurish and hammy . However , her portraits of respected men ( such as Henry Taylor , Charles Darwin , and Sir John Herschel ) have been consistently praised , both in her own life and in reviews of her work since . Her images have been described as extraordinarily powerful and wholly original , and she has been credited with producing the first close-ups in the history of the medium .",
