Though it encompasses a wide range of musical styles other than ragtime , and Joplin did not refer to it as such , it is sometimes referred to as a ragtime opera . The music of Treemonisha includes an overture and prelude , along with various recitatives , choruses , small ensemble pieces , a ballet , and a few arias . The opera was largely unknown before its first complete performance in 1972 . Joplin was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1976 for Treemonisha . The performance was called a semimiracle by music historian Gilbert Chase , who said Treemonisha bestowed its creative vitality and moral message upon many thousands of delighted listeners and viewers when it was recreated . The musical style of the opera is the popular romantic one of the early 20th century . It has been described as charming and piquant and . deeply moving , with elements of black folk songs and dances , including a kind of pre-blues music , spirituals , and a call-and-response style scene featuring a preacher and congregation . The opera celebrates African-American music and culture while stressing that education is the salvation of the Negro race . The heroine and symbolic educator is Treemonisha , who runs into trouble with a local band of conjurers , who kidnap her .",
