  "/wiki/Alan_Shepard": "Rear Admiral Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. ( November 18 , 1923 - July 21 , 1998 ) was an American astronaut , naval aviator , test pilot , and businessman . In 1961 he became the first American to travel into space , and in 1971 he walked on the Moon . A graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis , Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II . He became a naval aviator in 1946 , and a test pilot in 1950 . He was selected as one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959 , and in May 1961 he made the first crewed Project Mercury flight , Mercury-Redstone 3 , in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7 . His craft entered space , but was not capable of achieving orbit . He became the second person , and the first American , to travel into space , and the first space traveler to manually control the orientation of his craft . In the final stages of Project Mercury , Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 ( MA-10 ) , which was planned as a three-day mission . He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B Freedom 7 II in honor of his first spacecraft , but the mission was canceled . Shepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Project Gemini mission , but was grounded in 1963 due to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re 's disease , an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea . This was surgically corrected in 1969 , and in 1971 , Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission , piloting the Apollo Lunar Module Antares to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions . At age 47 , he became the fifth , the oldest , and the earliest-born person to walk on the Moon , and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so .",
  "/wiki/Astronaut": "An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command , pilot , or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft . Although generally reserved for professional space travelers , the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space , including scientists , politicians , journalists and tourists . Until 2002 , astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments , either by the military or by civilian space agencies . With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004 , a new category of astronaut was created : the commercial astronaut .",
  "/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_3": "Mercury-Redstone 3 , or Freedom 7 , was the first United States human spaceflight , on May 5 , 1961 , piloted by astronaut Alan Shepard . It was the first crewed flight of Project Mercury , the objective of which was to put an astronaut into orbit around the Earth and return him safely . Shepard 's mission was a 15-minute suborbital flight with the primary objective of demonstrating his ability to withstand the high g-forces of launch and atmospheric re-entry . Shepard named his space capsule Freedom 7 , setting a precedent for the remaining six Mercury astronauts naming their spacecraft . The number 7 was included in all the crewed Mercury spacecraft names to honor NASA 's first group of seven astronauts . His spacecraft reached an altitude of 101.2 nautical miles ( 116.5 statute miles , 187.5 km ) and traveled a downrange distance of 263.1 nautical miles ( 302.8 statute miles , 487.3 km ) . It was the fourth Mercury flight launched with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle , [ Note 1 ] from Cape Canaveral , Florida , close to the Atlantic Ocean . During the flight , Shepard observed the Earth and tested the capsule 's attitude control system , turning the capsule around to face its blunt heat shield forward for atmospheric re-entry . He also tested the retrorockets which would return later missions from orbit , though the capsule did not have enough energy to remain in orbit . After re-entry , the capsule landed by parachute on the North Atlantic Ocean off the Bahamas . Shepard and the capsule were picked up by helicopter and brought to U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Lake Champlain . The mission was a technical success , though American pride in the accomplishment was damped by the fact that just three weeks before , the Soviet Union had launched the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , who completed one orbit on Vostok 1 .",
  "/wiki/Mercury_Seven": "The Mercury Seven were the group of seven astronauts selected to fly spacecraft for Project Mercury . They are also referred to as the Original Seven and Astronaut Group 1 . Their names were publicly announced by NASA on April 9 , 1959 . These seven original American astronauts were Scott Carpenter , Gordon Cooper , John Glenn , Gus Grissom , Wally Schirra , Alan Shepard , and Deke Slayton . The Mercury Seven created a new profession in the United States , and established the image of the American astronaut for decades to come . All of the Mercury Seven eventually flew in space . They piloted the six spaceflights of the Mercury program that had an astronaut on board from May 1961 to May 1963 , and members of the group flew on all of the NASA human spaceflight programs of the 20th century - Mercury , Gemini , Apollo , and the Space Shuttle . Shepard became the first American to enter space in 1961 , and later walked on the Moon on Apollo 14 in 1971 . Grissom flew Mercury and Gemini missions , but died in 1967 in the Apollo 1 fire ; the others all survived past retirement from service . Schirra flew Apollo 7 , the first Apollo mission , in Grissom 's place . Slayton , grounded with an atrial fibrillation , ultimately flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 . Glenn became the first American in orbit in 1962 , and flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998 to become , at age 77 , the oldest person to fly in space .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_14": "Apollo 14 was the eighth crewed mission in the United States Apollo program , the third to land on the Moon , and the first to land in the lunar highlands . It was the last of the H missions , targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar EVAs , or moonwalks . Commander Alan Shepard , Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa , and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell launched on their nine-day mission on Sunday , January 31 , 1971 , at 4:03:02 p.m. EST . Liftoff was delayed forty minutes and two seconds , due to launch site weather restrictions , the first such delay in the Apollo program . Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro highlands - originally the target of the aborted Apollo 13 mission . During the two lunar EVAs , 94.35 pounds ( 42.80 kg ) of Moon rocks were collected , and several scientific experiments were performed . Shepard hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought with him . Shepard and Mitchell spent 33\u200b1\u20442 hours on the Moon , with almost 9\u200b1\u20442 hours of EVA . In the aftermath of Apollo 13 , several modifications had been made to the service module electrical power system to prevent a repeat of that accident , including a redesign of the oxygen tanks and the addition of a third tank . The launch had been scheduled for October 1 , 1970 , and was delayed about four months . While Shepard and Mitchell were on the surface , Roosa remained in lunar orbit aboard the command and service module Kittyhawk , performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon , including the landing site of the future Apollo 16 mission . He took several hundred seeds on the mission , many of which were germinated on return , resulting in the so-called Moon trees .",

The mission began on July 26 , 1971 , and ended on August 7 , the lunar surface exploration taking place between July 30 and August 2 . Commander David Scott and Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin landed near Hadley Rille and explored the local area using the rover , allowing them to travel further from the lunar module than had been possible on previous missions . They spent 18\u200b1\u20442 hours on the Moon 's surface on extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , and collected 170 pounds ( 77 kg ) of surface material . At the same time , Command Module Pilot Alfred Worden orbited the Moon , operating the sensors in the SIM bay of the service module . This suite of instruments collected data on the Moon and its environment using a panoramic camera , a gamma-ray spectrometer , a mapping camera , a laser altimeter , a mass spectrometer , and a lunar subsatellite deployed at the end of the moonwalks . The lunar module returned safely to the command module and , at the end of Apollo 15 's 74th lunar orbit the engine was fired for the journey home . During the return trip Worden performed the first spacewalk in deep space . The Apollo 15 mission splashed down safely on August 7 despite the loss of one of its three parachutes .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90 % of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",

Its three-astronaut crew - Frank Borman , James Lovell , and William Anders - were the first humans to fly to the Moon , to witness and photograph an Earthrise , and to escape the gravity of a celestial body . Apollo 8 launched on December 21 , 1968 , and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the United States Apollo space program after Apollo 7 , which stayed in Earth orbit . Apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center , located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . Originally planned as the second crewed Apollo Lunar Module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight . Astronaut Jim McDivitt 's crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit , became the crew for the Apollo 9 mission , and Borman 's crew were moved to the Apollo 8 mission . This left Borman 's crew with two to three months ' less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training . Apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the Moon . The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours , during which they made a Christmas Eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis .

The craft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 11 , 1970 , but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the service module ( SM ) failed two days into the mission . The crew instead looped around the Moon , and returned safely to Earth on April 17 . The mission was commanded by Jim Lovell with Jack Swigert as command module ( CM ) pilot and Fred Haise as lunar module ( LM ) pilot . Swigert was a late replacement for Ken Mattingly , who was grounded after exposure to rubella . Accidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank 's contents . Without oxygen , needed both for breathing and for generating electric power , the SM 's propulsion and life support systems could not operate . The CM 's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry , forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat . With the lunar landing canceled , mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive . Although the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days , Mission Control in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days . The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power , a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of potable water . There was a critical need to adapt the CM 's cartridges for the carbon dioxide removal system to work in the LM ; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution .",

  "/wiki/Helicopter_flight_controls": "A helicopter pilot manipulates the helicopter flight controls to achieve and maintain controlled aerodynamic flight . Changes to the aircraft flight control system transmit mechanically to the rotor , producing aerodynamic effects on the rotor blades that make the helicopter move in a deliberate way . To tilt forward and back ( pitch ) or sideways ( roll ) requires that the controls alter the angle of attack of the main rotor blades cyclically during rotation , creating differing amounts of lift ( force ) at different points in the cycle . To increase or decrease overall lift requires that the controls alter the angle of attack for all blades collectively by equal amounts at the same time , resulting in ascent , descent , acceleration and deceleration . A typical helicopter has three flight control inputs - the cyclic stick , the collective lever , and the anti-torque pedals . Depending on the complexity of the helicopter , the cyclic and collective may be linked together by a mixing unit , a mechanical or hydraulic device that combines the inputs from both and then sends along the mixed input to the control surfaces to achieve the desired result . The manual throttle may also be considered a flight control because it is needed to maintain rotor speed on smaller helicopters without governors .

  "/wiki/STS-114": "STS-114 was the first Return to Flight Space Shuttle mission following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster . Discovery launched at 10:39 EDT ( 14:39 UTC ) , 26 July 2005 . The launch , 907 days ( approx . 29 months ) after the loss of Columbia , was approved despite unresolved fuel sensor anomalies in the external tank that had prevented the shuttle from launching on 13 July , its originally scheduled date . The mission ended on 9 August 2005 when Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California . Poor weather over the Kennedy Space Center in Florida hampered the shuttle from using its primary landing site . Analysis of the launch footage showed debris separating from the external tank during ascent ; this was of particular concern because it was the issue that had set off the Columbia disaster . As a result , NASA decided on 27 July to postpone future shuttle flights pending additional modifications to the flight hardware . Shuttle flights resumed a year later with STS-121 on 4 July 2006 .",
