  "/wiki/History_of_Germany": "The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar , who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as Germania , thus distinguishing it from Gaul ( France ) , which he had conquered . The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest ( AD 9 ) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire , although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine . Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire , the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes . When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charles the Great 's heirs in 843 , the eastern part became East Francia . In 962 , Otto I became the first Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire , the medieval German state . In the Late Middle Ages , the regional dukes , princes , and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors . Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation against the Catholic Church after 1517 , as the northern states became Protestant , while the southern states remained Catholic . The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the Thirty Years ' War ( 1618-1648 ) , which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts . The Thirty Years ' War brought tremendous destruction to Germany ; more than 1/4 of the population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the catastrophic war . 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system , with Germany divided into numerous independent states , such as Prussia , Bavaria , Saxony , Austria and other states , which also controlled land outside of the area considered Germany . After the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars from 1803-1815 , feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction . The German revolutions of 1848-49 failed .",
  "/wiki/Political_theory": "Political philosophy , also known as political theory , is the study of topics such as politics , liberty , justice , property , rights , law , and the enforcement of laws by authority : what they are , if they are needed , what makes a government legitimate , what rights and freedoms it should protect , what form it should take , what the law is , and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government , if any , and when it may be legitimately overthrown , if ever . Political theory also engages questions of a broader scope , tackling the political nature of phenomena and categories such as identity , culture , sexuality , race , wealth , human-nonhuman relations , ecology , religion , and more . Political philosophy is a branch of philosophy , but it has also been a major part of political science , within which a strong focus has historically been placed on both the history of political thought and contemporary political theory ( from normative political theory to various critical approaches ) . In the Oxford Handbook in Political Theory ( 2006 ) , the field is described as : [ ... ] an interdisciplinary endeavor whose center of gravity lies at the humanities end of the happily still undisciplined discipline of political science ... For a long time , the challenge for the identity of political theory has been how to position itself productively in three sorts of location : in relation to the academic disciplines of political science , history , and philosophy ; between the world of politics and the more abstract , ruminative register of theory ; between canonical political theory and the newer resources ( such as feminist and critical theory , discourse analysis , film and film theory , popular and political culture , mass media studies , neuroscience , environmental studies , behavioral science , and economics ) on which political theorists increasingly draw .",

  "/wiki/International_law": "International law , also known as public international law and law of nations , is the set of rules , norms , and standards generally accepted in relations between nations . It establishes normative guidelines and a common conceptual framework to guide states across a broad range of domains , including war , diplomacy , trade , and human rights . International law thus provides a means for states to practice more stable , consistent , and organized international relations . The sources of international law include international custom ( general state practice accepted as law ) , treaties , and general principles of law recognized by most national legal systems . International law may also be reflected in international comity , the practices and customs adopted by states to maintain good relations and mutual recognition , such as saluting the flag of a foreign ship or enforcing a foreign judgment . International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily - though not exclusively - applicable to countries , rather than to individuals , and operates largely through consent , since there is no universally accepted authority to enforce it upon sovereign states . Consequently , states may choose to not abide by international law , and even to break a treaty . However , such violations , particularly of customary international law and peremptory norms ( jus cogens ) , can be met with coercive action , ranging from military intervention to diplomatic and economic pressure . The relationship and interaction between a national legal system ( municipal law ) and international law is complex and variable . National law may become international law when treaties permit national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court . Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to treaty provisions . National laws or constitutions may also provide for the implementation or integration of international legal obligations into domestic law .",

  "/wiki/History_of_the_United_States": "The history of the United States , a country in North America , started with the arrival of Native Americans in the United States from before 15,000 B.C . Numerous indigenous cultures formed , and many disappeared before 1500 . The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas . Most colonies were formed after 1600 , and the early records and writings of John Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded . By the 1760s , the thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . After defeating France , the British government imposed a series of taxes , including the Stamp Act of 1765 , rejecting the colonists ' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval . Resistance to these taxes , especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773 , led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government in Massachusetts . Armed conflict began in 1775 . In 1776 in Philadelphia , the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States . Led by General George Washington , it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France . The peace treaty of 1783 gave the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ) to the new nation . The Articles of Confederation established a central government , but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer .",

  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Environmental_history": "Environmental history is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time , emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa . Environmental history emerged in the United States out of the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s , and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns . The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities , population or sustainable development . As all history occurs in the natural world , environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales , geographic regions , or key themes . It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science . The subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components . The first , nature itself and its change over time , includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth 's land , water , atmosphere and biosphere . The second category , how humans use nature , includes the environmental consequences of increasing population , more effective technology and changing patterns of production and consumption . Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the neolithic revolution , the effects of colonial expansion and settlements , and the environmental and human consequences of the industrial and technological revolutions . Finally , environmental historians study how people think about nature - the way attitudes , beliefs and values influence interaction with nature , especially in the form of myths , religion and science .",

  "/wiki/Southeast_Asian_history": "Southeast Asia can be studied as two distinct sub-regions : Mainland Southeast Asia ( or Indochina ) , which comprises the modern states of Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Thailand , Myanmar ( Burma ) and West Malaysia , and Maritime Southeast Asia ( or Insular Southeast Asia ) , which comprises the modern states of Indonesia , East Malaysia , Singapore , Philippines , East Timor , Brunei , Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands , and Christmas Island . The earliest Homo sapiens presence in Mainland Southeast Asia can be traced back to 50,000 years ago and to at least 40,000 years ago in Maritime Southeast Asia . As early as 10,000 years ago , Hoabinhian settlers had developed a tradition and culture of distinct artefact and tool production . During the Neolithic , Austroasiatic peoples populated Indochina via land routes and sea-borne Austronesian immigrants preferably settled in insular Southeast Asia . The earliest agricultural societies that cultivated millet and wet-rice emerged around 1700 BCE in the lowlands and river floodplains of Indochina . The Phung Nguyen culture ( modern northern Vietnam ) and the Ban Chiang site ( modern Thailand ) account for the earliest use of copper by around 2,000 BCE , followed by the Dong Son culture , who by around 500 BCE had developed a highly sophisticated industry of bronze production and processing . Around the same time the first Agrarian Kingdoms emerged where territory was abundant and favourable , such as Funan at the lower Mekong and Van Lang in the Red River delta . Smaller and insular principalities increasingly engaged in and contributed to the rapidly expanding sea trade . The history of Southeast Asia has been greatly influenced by its wide topographical diversity . Maritime Southeast Asia is apart from exceptions like Borneo and Sumatra a patchwork of recurring land-sea patterns on widely dispersed islands and archipelagos . A discontinuity , that admitted moderately sized thalassocratic states indifferent to territorial ambitions where growth and prosperity was associated with sea trade . Mainland Southeast Asia with a continuous , but rugged and difficult terrain provided the basis for the early Khmer and Mon civilisations .",

  "/wiki/Gender": "Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to , and differentiating between , masculinity and femininity . Depending on the context , these characteristics may include biological sex ( i.e. , the state of being male , female , or an intersex variation ) , sex-based social structures ( i.e. , gender roles ) , or gender identity . Most cultures use a gender binary , having two genders ( boys/men and girls/women ) ; those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer . Some societies have specific genders besides man and woman , such as the hijras of South Asia ; these are often referred to as third genders ( and fourth genders , etc ) . Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955 . Before his work , it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories . However , Money 's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s , when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender . Today , the distinction is followed in some contexts , especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . In other contexts , including some areas of the social sciences , gender includes sex or replaces it . For instance , in non-human animal research , gender is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals . This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s . In 1993 , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) started to use gender instead of sex .",
  "/wiki/Culture": "Culture ( /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r/ ) is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies , as well as the knowledge , beliefs , arts , laws , customs , capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups . Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization , which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies . A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society ; it serves as a guideline for behavior , dress , language , and demeanor in a situation , which serves as a template for expectations in a social group . Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks , just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change , for lack of functional responses to the change . Thus in military culture , valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual , as are duty , honor , and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict . In the practice of religion , analogous attributes can be identified in a social group .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) ."
