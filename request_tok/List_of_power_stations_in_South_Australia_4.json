  "/wiki/Canunda_Wind_Farm": "Canunda Wind Farm ( formerly named Lake Bonney Central Wind Farm ) is a $ 92.5 million , 46 MW wind power project located on grazing land approximately 16 kilometres south of Millicent , and 6 kilometres west of Tantanoola in South Australia . It is jointly owned by GDF Suez Energy AustraliaEn 72% ) and Mitsui ( 28% ) . The wind farm is made up of 23 Vestas 2.0 MW wind turbines , together with an underground electrical cable network , access tracks , crane hardstandings , wind monitoring masts and a 33 kV double-circuit distribution line . Each turbine consists of a 67-metre-high ( 220 ft ) tower and 40-metre-long ( 130 ft ) blades , and so are 107 metres in height to the tip of the blade . These wind turbines rotate at speeds between 9 rpm and 19 rpm , depending on the wind speed . The wind yield in South Australia enables Canunda to produce electricity at a 34 per cent capacity factor , a high yield by global standards . The wind farm generates enough electricity to supply around 30,000 average South Australian homes . The Canunda Wind Farm distribution line is 16 km long and transports the generated electricity from the wind farm to a nearby substation at Snuggery . The distribution line traverses mostly roadside verges , avoiding areas of environmental sensitivity along the route . The Canunda Wind Farm provides a number of benefits to the local and wider community , including clean electricity generation , enhanced agricultural viability of the farms involved and increased diversity of electricity supply for South Australia and the south east in particular . There has also been widespread community interest in the project and site tours have commenced . The Canunda Wind Farm was opened by the Premier of South Australia , Mike Rann , on 31 March 2005 .",
