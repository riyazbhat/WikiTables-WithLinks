  "/wiki/Alternate_timeline": "Alternate history or alternative history ( Commonwealth English ) ( AH ) is a genre of speculative fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently . These stories usually contain what if scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record . The stories are conjectural but are sometimes based on fact . Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary fiction , science fiction , or historical fiction ; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres . Another term occasionally used for the genre is allohistory ( literally other history ) . Since the 1950s , this type of fiction has , to a large extent , merged with science fiction tropes involving time travel between alternate histories , psychic awareness of the existence of one universe by the people in another , or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more timelines . Cross-time , time-splitting , and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another . In Spanish , French , German , Portuguese , Italian , Catalan and Galician , the genre of alternate history is called uchronie / ucronia / ucron\u00eda / Uchronie , which has given rise to the term Uchronia in English . This neologism is based on the prefix \u03bf\u03c5- ( which in Ancient Greek means not/not any/no ) and the Greek \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( chronos ) , meaning time . A uchronia means literally ( in ) no time . This term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list , uchronia.net .",

The program follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation . Every day , the boys embark on some grand new project ; these are usually unrealistic given the protagonists ' ages ( and are sometimes downright physically impossible ) , which annoys their controlling sister , Candace , who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas ' mother , Linda Flynn-Fletcher , and less frequently to Ferb 's father , Lawrence Fletcher . The series follows a standard plot system : running gags occur every episode , and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb 's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ( named Agent P ) for OWCA ( the Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) , to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz , a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness ( although he is not especially evil and has a good heart in some situations ) . The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys ' project just before Candace can show it to their mother . This usually leaves Candace very frustrated . Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh had previously worked together on Fox 's The Simpsons and Nickelodeon 's Rocko 's Modern Life . The creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters : Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz .

Other works deviate from this theme to varying degrees , focusing more on romantic interactions between the characters , side stories which did not appear in the original works , and/or reimaginings of the conflicts from the original works . The Neon Genesis Evangelion manga debuted in Sh\u014dnen Ace in December 1994 , as a way to generate interest in the upcoming anime release . The Neon Genesis Evangelion anime was written and directed by Hideaki Anno and originally aired from October 1995 to March 1996 . The show was groundbreaking , delving into religious , psychological and philosophical themes on an otherwise standard mecha backdrop . There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series . In response , two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show : Neon Genesis Evangelion : Death & Rebirth , released in March 1997 , and The End of Evangelion released in July 1997 .

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films , The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve . MacFarlane redesigned the films ' protagonist , Larry , and his dog , Steve , and renamed them Peter and Brian , respectively . MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998 , and the show was greenlit and began production .

Unlike MacFarlane 's other shows , Family Guy and , to a lesser extent , The Cleveland Show , American Dad ! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags , and is less concerned with conventional setup-punchline jokes , instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters , the relationships between family members , and the relatively relatable plots .

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies .
