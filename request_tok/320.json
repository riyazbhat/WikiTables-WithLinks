Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) south of Cuba , and 191 kilometres ( 119 mi ) west of Hispaniola ( the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres ( 134 mi ) to the north-west . Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 . With 2.9 million people , Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas ( after the United States and Canada ) , and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean .

  "/wiki/No_No_Never": "No No Never was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 , performed in English by Texas Lightning . While Germany had finished the 2005 Contest in last place , their position as one of the Contest 's Big Four ( along with the United Kingdom , France and Spain ) ensured the song an automatic final berth . Thus , it was performed eighth on the night , following Malta 's Fabrizio Faniello with I Do and preceding Denmark 's Sidsel Ben Semmane with Twist of Love . At the close of voting , it had received 36 points , placing 14th in a field of 24 . Written and composed by Australian-born band member Jane Comerford , the unusual choice of country as the genre resulted in BBC commentator Terry Wogan asking jokingly and with a rough approximation of the appropriate accent are we in Athens , Georgia ? at the end of the performance ( the Contest was held in Athens , Greece ) . Lyrically , the song can be read as a pledge of the singer 's undying love for her lover , but Comerford has stated that the chorus at least - I 'm never ever gon na leave you to cry on your own/Never ever gon na not go and pick up the phone/I 'm never ever gon na let you be chilled to the bone - was inspired by her desire to comfort her niece upon the untimely death of her niece 's father . As one of the band 's members is a professional comedian , there was a level of expectation that the performance was going to be humorous , however this was not the case . While the band performed in front of artificial cactus plants , there was in fact very little overt humour in the performance . All members were dressed appropriately , with the musicians wearing beige suits and stetson hats and Comerford wearing a pink dress . The song was succeeded as the German representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 by Roger Cicero with Frauen regier ' n die Welt .",

The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue .
