Godzilla has been dubbed the King of the Monsters , a phrase first used in Godzilla , King of the Monsters ! , the Americanized version of the original film . Godzilla is depicted as an enormous , destructive , prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation . With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Lucky Dragon 5 incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness , Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons . As the film series expanded , some stories took on less serious undertones , portraying Godzilla as an antihero , or a lesser threat who defends humanity . With the end of the Cold War , several post-1984 Godzilla films shifted the character 's portrayal to themes including Japan 's forgetfulness over its imperial past , natural disasters and the human condition . Godzilla has been featured alongside many supporting characters . It has faced human opponents such as the JSDF , or other monsters , including King Ghidorah , Mechagodzilla and Gigan . Godzilla sometimes has allies , such as Rodan , Mothra and Anguirus , and offspring , such as Minilla and Godzilla Junior .

Mothra has appeared in several Toho tokusatsu films , most often as a recurring character in the Godzilla franchise . She is typically portrayed as a colossal sentient larva ( caterpillar ) or imago ( moth ) , accompanied by two miniature female humanoids speaking on her behalf . Unlike other Toho monsters , Mothra is a largely heroic character , having been variously portrayed as a protector of her own island culture , the Earth and Japan . Though identified as a kind of moth , the character 's design incorporates elements more frequently associated with butterflies , and has caddisfly-like mandibles rather than a proboscis . The character is often depicted hatching offspring ( in some cases , twins ) when approaching death , a nod to the Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra doctrine of numerous Indian religions . Mothra is one of Tohos most popular monsters and second only to Godzilla in her total number of film appearances . Polls taken during the early 1990s indicated that Mothra was particularly popular among women who were , at the time , the largest demographic among Japan 's movie-going audience , a fact that prompted the filming of 1992 's Godzilla vs. Mothra , which was the best-attended Toho film since King Kong vs. Godzilla .
