A more recent Tatar settlement was also founded at the location by Hac\u0131 I Giray , the Khan of Crimea in 1440 that was named after him as Hac\u0131bey . After a period of Lithuanian Grand Duchy control , Hacibey and surroundings became part of the domain of the Ottomans in 1529 and remained there until the empire 's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792 . In 1794 , the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the Russian empress Catherine the Great . From 1819 to 1858 , Odessa was a free port - a porto-franco . During the Soviet period , it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base . On 1 January 2000 , the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years . During the 19th century , Odessa was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia , after Moscow , Saint Petersburg and Warsaw .

The next year saw him step up to the very upper echelon of javelin throwers with his new personal best ( and national record ) of 86.33 meters , thrown in Helsinki on 16 July 1963 . This was very close to the world record at the time ( 86.74 m ) . In the Olympic year 1964 however , Nevala had major problems even breaking 80 meters and did not enter the Tokyo Olympics as a favorite . He cleared the Olympic qualification quite easily while the world record holder , Terje Pedersen of Norway , was knocked out - the first man not to qualify . In the final Nevala threw confidently from the start , and took the lead with his fourth throw of 82.66 m , his best that year . This was eventually enough for a victory , narrowly ahead of Gergely Kulcs\u00e1r . After the Olympics Nevala 's career stagnated . He finished fourth at the 1966 European Athletics Championships at Budapest . His attempt to defend his Olympic title at the 1968 Summer Olympics was cut short in the qualification as his longest throw was controversially declared flat and he failed to advance to the final . In 1969 Nevala 's career had a major resurgence , as he finally broke his six-year-old personal best multiple times , culminating in a 91.40 m throw in his home town of Teuva .",

This effort added more than two meters to the previous world record , fueling discussion and speculation regarding the likelihood of alterations to the javelin 's design and flight characteristics . Proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986 , following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record ; the first coming in 1983 , when Tom Petranoff , then of the United States , added precisely three meters to Paragi 's mark , and the other in 1984 , when East German Uwe Hohn launched the 800 gram implement to 104.80 meters . Hohn 's mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed , and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change . Indeed , the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings , which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal , most famously in the high-profile case at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the eventual winner Dainis K\u016bla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw . Ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately , compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot . Paragi also competed at the Moscow Olympics . Even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 96.20 on 18 May 1980 , there could be no question he was among the leading favorites . However , he had problems in the qualifying round , languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a sub-standard mark of 72.60 , but saved himself by throwing 88.76 with his third and final attempt - the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters . Next day in the final however , he could do no better than 79.52 and finished in tenth place . His qualification performance would have been enough for a bronze .

Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation , it is Australia 's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall . The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory ; 280 km ( 170 mi ) south-west of Sydney and 660 km ( 410 mi ) north-east of Melbourne . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 . The Griffins ' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles , hexagons and triangles , and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory . The city 's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation . As the seat of the government of Australia , Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government , national monuments and museums ."
