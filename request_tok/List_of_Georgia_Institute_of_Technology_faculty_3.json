  "/wiki/Nondestructive_testing": "Nondestructive testing ( NDT ) is a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material , component or system without causing damage . The terms nondestructive examination ( NDE ) , nondestructive inspection ( NDI ) , and nondestructive evaluation ( NDE ) are also commonly used to describe this technology . Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected , it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation , troubleshooting , and research . The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current , magnetic-particle , liquid penetrant , radiographic , ultrasonic , and visual testing . NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering , mechanical engineering , petroleum engineering , electrical engineering , civil engineering , systems engineering , aeronautical engineering , medicine , and art . Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on medical imaging , including on echocardiography , medical ultrasonography , and digital radiography . Various national and international trade associations exist to promote the industry , knowledge about non-destructive testing , and to develop standard methods and training . These include the American Society for Nondestructive Testing , the Non-Destructive Testing Management Association , the International Committee for Non-Destructive Testing , the European Federation for Non-Destructive Testing and the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing . NDT methods rely upon use of electromagnetic radiation , sound and other signal conversions to examine a wide variety of articles ( metallic and non-metallic , food-product , artifacts and antiquities , infrastructure ) for integrity , composition , or condition with no alteration of the article undergoing examination . Visual inspection ( VT ) , the most commonly applied NDT method , is quite often enhanced by the use of magnification , borescopes , cameras , or other optical arrangements for direct or remote viewing . The internal structure of a sample can be examined for a volumetric inspection with penetrating radiation ( RT ) , such as X-rays , neutrons or gamma radiation . Sound waves are utilized in the case of ultrasonic testing ( UT ) , another volumetric NDT method - the mechanical signal ( sound ) being reflected by conditions in the test article and evaluated for amplitude and distance from the search unit ( transducer ) .",
  "/wiki/Acoustics": "Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases , liquids , and solids including topics such as vibration , sound , ultrasound and infrasound . A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer . The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries . Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world , and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture . Accordingly , the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society - music , medicine , architecture , industrial production , warfare and more . Likewise , animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories . Art , craft , science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole , as in many other fields of knowledge . Robert Bruce Lindsay 's Wheel of Acoustics is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics .",
  "/wiki/Ultrasonics": "Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing . Ultrasound is not different from normal ( audible ) sound in its physical properties , except that humans can not hear it . This limit varies from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz ( 20,000 hertz ) in healthy young adults . Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz . Ultrasound is used in many different fields . Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances . Ultrasound imaging or sonography is often used in medicine . In the nondestructive testing of products and structures , ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws . Industrially , ultrasound is used for cleaning , mixing , and accelerating chemical processes . Animals such as bats and porpoises use ultrasound for locating prey and obstacles .",

  "/wiki/MOCVD": "Metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy ( MOVPE ) , also known as organometallic vapour-phase epitaxy ( OMVPE ) or metalorganic chemical vapour deposition ( MOCVD ) , is a chemical vapour deposition method used to produce single- or polycrystalline thin films . It is a process for growing crystalline layers to create complex semiconductor multilayer structures . In contrast to molecular-beam epitaxy ( MBE ) , the growth of crystals is by chemical reaction and not physical deposition . This takes place not in vacuum , but from the gas phase at moderate pressures ( 10 to 760 Torr ) . As such , this technique is preferred for the formation of devices incorporating thermodynamically metastable alloys , [ citation needed ] and it has become a major process in the manufacture of optoelectronics . It was invented in 1968 at North American Aviation ( later Rockwell International ) Science Center by Harold M. Manasevit .",

  "/wiki/Roboticist": "Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering , electronic engineering , information engineering , computer science , and others . Robotics deals with the design , construction , operation , and use of robots , as well as computer systems for their control , sensory feedback , and information processing . These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions . Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes , but today many are used in dangerous environments ( including bomb detection and deactivation ) , manufacturing processes , or where humans can not survive ( e.g . in space , under water , in high heat , and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation ) . Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance . This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people . Such robots attempt to replicate walking , lifting , speech , cognition , or any other human activity . Many of today 's robots are inspired by nature , contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics . The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times , but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century . Throughout history , it has been frequently assumed by various scholars , inventors , engineers , and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion . Today , robotics is a rapidly growing field , as technological advances continue ; researching , designing , and building new robots serve various practical purposes , whether domestically , commercially , or militarily .",

  "/wiki/Technology_Review": "MIT Technology Review is a magazine wholly owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and editorially independent of the university . It was founded in 1899 as The Technology Review , and was re-launched without The in its name on April 23 , 1998 under then publisher R. Bruce Journey . In September 2005 , it was changed , under its then editor-in-chief and publisher , Jason Pontin , to a form resembling the historical magazine . Before the 1998 re-launch , the editor stated that nothing will be left of the old magazine except the name . It was therefore necessary to distinguish between the modern and the historical Technology Review . The historical magazine had been published by the MIT Alumni Association , was more closely aligned with the interests of MIT alumni , and had a more intellectual tone and much smaller public circulation . The magazine , billed from 1998 to 2005 as MIT 's Magazine of Innovation , and from 2005 onwards as simply published by MIT , focused on new technology and how it is commercialized ; was sold to the public and targeted at senior executives , researchers , financiers , and policymakers , as well as MIT alumni .

  "/wiki/International_Aerial_Robotics_Competition": "The International Aerial Robotics Competition ( IARC ) began in 1991 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology and is the longest running university-based robotics competition in the world . Since 1991 , collegiate teams with the backing of industry and government have fielded autonomous flying robots in an attempt to perform missions requiring robotic behaviors never before exhibited by a flying machine . In 1990 , the term aerial robotics was coined by competition creator Robert Michelson to describe a new class of small highly intelligent flying machines . The successive years of competition saw these aerial robots grow in their capabilities from vehicles that could at first barely maintain themselves in the air , to the most recent automatons which are self-stable , self-navigating , and able to interact with their environment - especially objects on the ground . The primary goal of the competition has been to provide a reason for the state of the art in aerial robotics to move forward . Challenges set before the international collegiate community have been geared towards producing advances in the state of the art at an increasingly aggressive pace . From 1991 through 2009 , a total of six missions have been proposed . Each of them involved fully autonomous robotic behavior that was undemonstrated at the time and impossible for any robotic system fielded anywhere in the world , even by the most sophisticated military robots belonging to the super powers . In October 2013 a new seventh mission was proposed . As with previous missions , the Mission 7 involves totally autonomous flying robots , but this is the first IARC mission to involve the interaction between multiple ground robots and even simultaneous competition between two aerial robots working against each other and against the clock to influence the behavior and trajectory of up to ten autonomous ground robots . In 2016 , the International Aerial Robotics Competition and its creator were officially recognized during the Georgia legislative session in the form of Senate Resolution 1255 which recognized it as the longest running aerial robotics competition in the world and for having been responsible for moving forward the state of the art in aerial robotics on several occasions during the past quarter century .",
