In the mid-1960s , he had two books published : In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works , both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings . Starting with 1967 's All You Need Is Love , his lyrics espoused a pacifist message , and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture . From 1968 to 1972 , Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono , including a trilogy of avant-garde albums , his first solo LP John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band , and the international top 10 singles Give Peace a Chance , Instant Karma ! , Imagine and Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) .

It was a 2005 Grammy Award nominee . A long-time engineer and producer for Atlantic Records , Dowd was responsible for some of the most important R & B , rock , and jazz records ever made . In his own words , Dowd relates how he went from working on the Manhattan Project as rising physicist , while still high school age , to recording some of the greatest music ever made over the last half of the 20th century . His technical genius opened the door to modern music and made the studio a crucial element in the formula of musical artistry . His use of the multitrack eight-track tape recorder at Atlantic Records in the late 1950s not only added an amazing dimension to the sound of music ( he is also credited with taking music recording from monaural to stereo ) , it also gave musicians and producers greater control over their musical productions and identities . For the first time , it was possible to isolate musical sounds and then manipulate ( mix ) its parts in the recording process . The movie Ray provides a demonstration of how Dowd 's genius escalated musical artistry and revved up the popular music industry . In one scene , Dowd is shown in the studio directing the recording of Ray Charles ' music for Atlantic Records executive Ahmet Ertegun . After Charles dismisses his backup singers , the Raelettes , because of tension with Margie Hendricks , the lead Raelette , Dowd plays back what has been recorded thus far and Charles instantly picks up a difference in the sound .

Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s , when songs such as Blowin ' in the Wind ( 1963 ) and The Times They Are a-Changin ' ( 1964 ) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement . His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences , defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Following his self-titled debut album in 1962 , which mainly comprised traditional folk songs , Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan the following year . The album featured Blowin ' in the Wind and the thematically complex A Hard Rain 's a- Gon na Fall . For many of these songs , he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs . He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin ' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 . In 1965 and 1966 , Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation , and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s : Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) . Commenting on the six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone ( 1965 ) , Rolling Stone wrote : No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time , for all time .

  "/wiki/Brian_Wilson": "Brian Douglas Wilson ( born June 20 , 1942 ) is an American musician , singer , songwriter , and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys . After signing with Capitol Records in 1962 , Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group . In addition to his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques , Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with mental illness . He is often referred to as a genius and is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century . The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers Dennis and Carl , their cousin Mike Love , and friend Al Jardine . Brian , who grew up influenced by 1950s rock and roll and jazz-based vocal groups , originally functioned as the band 's songwriter , producer , co-lead vocalist , bassist , keyboardist , and de facto leader . In 1964 , he suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with the group , which led to more personal work such as Pet Sounds ( 1966 ) and the unfinished Smile . As his mental health deteriorated , his contributions to the band diminished , and over the next decade , he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and substance abuse . Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy , Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment , and in the late 1990s , he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist . He remains a member of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Inc. Wilson was the first pop artist credited for writing , arranging , producing , and performing his own material . He is considered a major innovator in the field of music production , the principal originator of the California Sound , one of the first music producer auteurs , and the first rock producer to use the studio as its own instrument . The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers .",

The documentary was originally called The Re-Invented Process , referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS . It starts with imagery from the exhibition and Madonna auditioning dancers for the tour , continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing , the singer 's introspection on her life , her marriage , her religion , and her children , and ends with Madonna 's visit to Israel in the midst of protests . The documentary was inspired by Madonna 's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah . Unlike her 1991 documentary Truth or Dare , which portrayed Hollywood glamour , I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer 's personal views on life and spirituality . Like Truth or Dare , the performance scenes were shot in color , while the rest of the film was in black-and-white . Besides Madonna , her dancers and her tour entourage , \u00c5kerlund also shot her family , her working process and her day-to-day life . Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie 's local pub in Mayfair , London was used for some sequences . The film features appearances from Madonna 's father , stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore .

With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time .

Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records .

Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows .

In 1955 , drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley 's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who would manage him for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , Heartbreak Hotel , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial .
