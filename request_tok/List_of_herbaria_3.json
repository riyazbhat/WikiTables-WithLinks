  "/wiki/Toronto": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 . Current to 2016 , the Toronto census metropolitan area ( CMA ) , of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , held a population of 5,928,040 , making it Canada 's most populous CMA . The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants",
