The album was promoted in early 2010 with a series of gigs under the name Renegades , with the shows serving to showcase songs that would be on the new album . The name change was done as Grant Nicholas considered it to be a band within Feeder and therefore wished to avert expectations from fans for the band to play their older hit songs . The album was moderately well received in Britain , charting at number 16 , making it the first time since their 1997 debut Polythene that the band failed to reach the top 10 with a new studio album . However , this was considered a success by the band considering it was released on their own label and not on the major Echo Label , and was therefore self-funded and promoted on a much smaller scale . Frontman Grant Nicholas said Im quite proud of what weve achieved on just a very small scale on a tiny little label .

The album 's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session , splitting the album between uptempo tracks and ballads to reflect conflicting emotions . Early sessions at the Bear Creek studio in Washington went poorly and the band discarded most of those recordings . The band regrouped without Goldsmith in early 1997 to record at Hollywood 's Grandmaster Recordings studio , with Grohl sitting in on drums instead .

It was produced by Greg Kurstin and released worldwide on September 15 , 2017 , through RCA Records . Described by the band as an album where hard rock extremes and pop sensibilities collide , Concrete and Gold concerns the future of the United States from the viewpoint of the band 's frontman and lead songwriter Dave Grohl , with the heated atmosphere of the 2016 elections and the presidency of Donald Trump cited as major influences by Grohl . Juxtapositions serve as a common motif in both the album 's lyrical and musical composition , with Grohl further describing the album 's overall theme as hope and desperation . Writing and recording of Concrete and Gold started in late 2016 , after Grohl ended a self-imposed six-month hiatus from music while recovering from an injury sustained on the Sonic Highways World Tour . Working off a set of twelve or thirteen ideas for songs conceived by Grohl , the band enlisted the help of Kurstin , a pop music producer , who had never worked on a heavy rock record previously . The studio at which the band chose to record Concrete and Gold , EastWest Studios in Hollywood , California , fostered collaborations with various other artists who were also working at the studio at the time , including Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men , Justin Timberlake , and Paul McCartney .
