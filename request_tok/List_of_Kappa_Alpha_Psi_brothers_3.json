  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",

  "/wiki/Elwood_Buchanan": "Elwood C. Buchanan , Sr was an American jazz trumpeter and teacher who became an early mentor of Miles Davis .

Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style , and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another .

Although Davis , at thirteen , was then too young to attend Buchanan 's school , Buchanan began giving him private lessons . Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln . Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz , the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis ' jazz style . In particular , Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato , and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding : Stop shakin ' that note . You 're going to shake enough when you get old . Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean , relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett ( then little known beyond the East Coast ) and Harold Shorty Baker .",

Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz . Born in Alton , Illinois and raised in East St. Louis , Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City , before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948 . Shortly after , he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz . In the early 1950s , Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight . It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s . During this period , he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans , such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain ( 1960 ) , and band recordings , such as Milestones ( 1958 ) and Kind of Blue ( 1959 ) . The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time , having sold over four million copies in the U.S. Davis made several line-up changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come ( 1961 ) , his 1961 Blackhawk concerts , and Seven Steps to Heaven ( 1963 ) , another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter , pianist Herbie Hancock , and drummer Tony Williams . After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964 , Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members , helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P ( 1965 ) and Miles Smiles ( 1967 ) , before transitioning into his electric period .

  "/wiki/Saxophone": "The saxophone ( referred to colloquially as the sax ) is a woodwind instrument usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece . Although most saxophones are made from brass , they are categorized as woodwind instruments , because sound is produced by an oscillating reed , traditionally made out of woody cane , rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family . As with the other woodwind instruments , the pitch of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by changing the effective length of the tube . The player covers holes by pressing mechanical keys , triggering a system of pads , pivots , and linkages . The saxophone is used in classical music ( such as concert bands , chamber music , solo repertoire , and , occasionally , orchestras ) , military bands , marching bands , jazz ( such as big bands and jazz combos ) , and contemporary music . The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music . Saxophone players are called saxophonists . Since the first saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s , saxophones have been produced in a variety of series distinguished by transpositions within instrument sets and tuning standard . Sax patented the saxophone on 28 June 1846 , in two groups of seven instruments each . Each series consisted of instruments ranked by pitch , in alternating transposition . The series pitched in B\u266d and E\u266d soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered today are from this series . Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax .",
