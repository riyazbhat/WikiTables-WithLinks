It occurred on 11 February . In the competition on the Okurayama jumping hill , conditions were variable and unfair according to a Norwegian account of the 1972 Games published in 2006 , and the result is described as the greatest surprise of all time on the jumping hill . In the first run , the 19-year-old Zakopane mechanic Wojciech Fortuna completed a leap of 111 metres , while Manfred Wolf of East Germany was runner-up after the first run having jumped 107 metres . Ji\u0159\u00ed Ra\u0161ka , Gariy Napalkov and Tauno K\u00e4yhk\u00f6 , all counted among the favourites according to Jorsett 's account , were all more than 12 metres behind , Yukio Kasaya , who won on the normal hill , landed on 90 metres , and Ingolf Mork , the 1972 Four Hills Tournament winner , touched down on 88 metres . Fortuna 's second jump was a more modest 87.5 metres ; still , the tenths of a point remained on his side . Again according to Jorsett , Steiner ( 103 metres ) , Schmidt ( 101 metres ) and K\u00e4yhk\u00f6 ( 100.5 metres ) got lucky with the wind in the second run , but all finished within 0.7 points of Fortuna . This was the smallest margin between first and fourth to date . Pudgar 's eighth place was the best placing by a Yugoslav at the Winter Olympics until Matja\u017e Debelak won bronze at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games",
