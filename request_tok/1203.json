  "/wiki/Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad": "The Louisville and Nashville Railroad ( reporting mark LN ) , commonly called the L & N , was a Class I railroad that operated freight and passenger services in the southeast United States . Chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1850 , the road grew into one of the great success stories of American business . Operating under one name continuously for 132 years , it survived civil war and economic depression and several waves of social and technological change . Under Milton H. Smith , president of the company for thirty years , the L & N grew from a road with less than three hundred miles ( 480 km ) of track to a 6,000-mile ( 9,700 km ) system serving fourteen states . As one of the premier Southern railroads , the L & N extended its reach far beyond its namesake cities , stretching to St. Louis , Memphis , Atlanta , and New Orleans . The railroad was economically strong throughout its lifetime , operating both freight and passenger trains in a manner that earned it the nickname , The Old Reliable . Growth of the railroad continued until its purchase and the tumultuous rail consolidations of the 1980s which led to continual successors . By the end of 1970 , L & N operated 6,063 miles ( 9,757 km ) of road on 10,051 miles ( 16,176 km ) of track , not including the Carrollton Railroad . In 1971 the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad , successor to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad , purchased the remainder of the L & N shares it did not already own , and the company became a subsidiary . By 1982 the railroad industry was consolidating quickly , and the Seaboard Coast Line absorbed the Louisville & Nashville Railroad entirely . Then in 1986 , the Seaboard System merged with the C & O and B & O and the new combined system was known as the Chessie System . Soon after the combined company became CSX Transportation ( CSX ) , which now owns and operates all of the former Louisville and Nashville lines .",

  "/wiki/Wilderness_Road": "The Wilderness Road was one of two principal routes used by colonial and early national era settlers to reach Kentucky from the East . Although this road goes through the Cumberland Gap into southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee , the other ( more northern route ) is sometimes called the Cumberland Road because it started in Fort Cumberland in Maryland . Despite Kentucky Senator Henry Clay 's advocacy of this route , early in the 19th century , the northern route was selected for the National Road , connecting near Washington , Pennsylvania into the Ohio Valley of northern Kentucky and Ohio . In 1775 , Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap . It was later lengthened , following Native American trails , to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville . The Wilderness Road was steep , rough and narrow , and could only be traversed on foot or horseback . By contrast , wagons could travel along the National Road route ( originally the Braddock Road blazed by the competing Ohio Company and George Washington circa 1750 ) , particularly after the improvements . Despite the adverse conditions , thousands of people used the Wilderness Road , particularly slaveholders after the states of Ohio , then Indiana and finally Illinois became free states ( abolishing slavery ) on the northern bank of the Ohio River , where travelers often embarked on boats to travel westward . In 1792 , the new Kentucky legislature provided money to upgrade the road . In 1796 , an improved all-weather road was opened for wagon and carriage travel . The road was abandoned around 1840 ( construction on the National Road after Vandalia , Illinois also stopping due to the Panic of 1837 and early railroad construction ) , although modern highways follow much of its route .",

Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia .
