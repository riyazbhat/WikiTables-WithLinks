  "/wiki/Townland": "A townland ( Irish : baile fearainn ; Ulster-Scots : toonlann ) is a small geographical division of land used in Ireland and in the Western Isles in Scotland . The townland system is of Gaelic origin , pre-dating the Norman invasion , and most have names of Irish Gaelic origin . However , some townland names and boundaries come from Norman manors , plantation divisions , or later creations of the Ordnance Survey . The total number of inhabited townlands in Ireland was 60,679 in 1911 . The total number recognised by the Irish Place Names database as of 2014 was 61,098 , including uninhabited townlands , mainly small islands",
  "/wiki/Acre": "The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems . It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong ( 66 by 660 feet ) , which is exactly equal to 10 square chains , \u200b1\u2044640 of a square mile , or 43,560 square feet , and approximately 4,047 m2 , or about 40 % of a hectare . Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen",
  "/wiki/Barony_(Ireland)": "In Ireland , a barony ( Irish : bar\u00fantacht , plural bar\u00fantachta\u00ed ) is a historical subdivision of a county , analogous to the hundreds into which the counties of England were divided . Baronies were created during the Tudor reconquest of Ireland , replacing the earlier cantreds formed after the original Norman invasion . Some early baronies were later subdivided into half baronies with the same standing as full baronies . Baronies were mainly cadastral rather than administrative units . They acquired modest local taxation and spending functions in the nineteenth century before being superseded by the Local Government ( Ireland ) Act 1898 . Subsequent adjustments of county boundaries mean that some baronies now straddle two counties . The final catalogue of baronies numbered 331 , with an average area of 255 km2 ( 98 sq mi ; 63,000 acres ) ; therefore , each county was divided , on average , into 10 or 11 baronies",
  "/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_Ireland": "Civil parishes ( Irish : par\u00f3ist\u00ed sibhialta , par\u00f3ist\u00ed dl\u00ed ) are units of territory in the island of Ireland that have their origins in old Gaelic territorial divisions . They were adopted by the Anglo-Norman Lordship of Ireland and then by the Elizabethan Kingdom of Ireland , and were formalised as land divisions at the time of the Plantations of Ireland . They no longer correspond to the boundaries of Roman Catholic or Church of Ireland parishes , which are generally larger . Their use as administrative units was gradually replaced by Poor Law Divisions in the 19th century , although they were not formally abolished . Today they are still sometimes used for legal purposes",
  "/wiki/Poor_law_union": "A poor law union was a geographical territory , and early local government unit , in the United Kingdom and Ireland . Poor law unions existed in England and Wales from 1834 to 1930 for the administration of poor relief . Prior to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the administration of the English Poor Laws was the responsibility of the vestries of individual parishes , which varied widely in their size , populations , financial resources , rateable values and requirements . From 1834 the parishes were grouped into unions , jointly responsible for the administration of poor relief in their areas and each governed by a board of guardians . A parish large enough to operate independently of a union was known as a poor law parish . Collectively , poor law unions and poor law parishes were known as poor law districts . The grouping of the parishes into unions caused larger centralised workhouses to be built to replace smaller facilities in each parish . Poor law unions were later used as a basis for the delivery of registration from 1837 , and sanitation outside urban areas from 1875 . Poor law unions were abolished by the Local Government Act 1929 , which transferred responsibility for public assistance to county and county borough councils",
