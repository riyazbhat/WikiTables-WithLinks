The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese . Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ) , numerous rump regimes loyal to the Ming throne - collectively called the Southern Ming - survived until 1662 . [ d ] The Hongwu Emperor ( r. 1368-1398 ) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the Jingnan Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats . One , Zheng He , led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa . The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances ; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely . The imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the Liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the Great Wall of China into its modern form .

Japanese rule prioritized Korea 's Japanization , accelerating industrialization started by the Gwangmu Reform , building public works , and fighting the Korean independence movement . Japanese rule over Korea ended on 15 August 1945 upon the Surrender of Japan in World War II and the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union occupied the territory . The Division of Korea separated the Korean Peninsula under two governments and economic systems with the northern Soviet Civil Administration and the southern United States Army Military Government in Korea . In 1965 , the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and South Korea declared the unequal treaties between Japan and Korea , especially 1905 and 1910 , were already null and void at the time of their promulgation . Japanese rule remains controversial in modern-day North Korea and South Korea and its negative repercussions continue to affect these countries , including the industrialization plan to solely benefit Japan , the exploitation of Korean people , the marginalization of Korean history and culture , the environmental exploitation of the Korean Peninsula , and the status of Japanese collaborators known as Chinilpa .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90 % of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",
