  "/wiki/Integrated_circuit": "An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit ( also referred to as an IC , a chip , or a microchip ) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece ( or chip ) of semiconductor material that is normally silicon . The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller , faster , and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components . The IC 's mass production capability , reliability , and building-block approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors . ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics . Computers , mobile phones , and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies , made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs . Integrated circuits were made practical by technological advancements in metal-oxide-silicon ( MOS ) semiconductor device fabrication . Since their origins in the 1960s , the size , speed , and capacity of chips have progressed enormously , driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size - a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail . These advances , roughly following Moore 's law , make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s . ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits : cost and performance . Cost is low because the chips , with all their components , are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time . Furthermore , packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits . Performance is high because the IC 's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity",
  "/wiki/Logistics": "Logistics is generally the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation . In a general business sense , logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet requirements of customers or corporations . The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials , equipment , and supplies , as well as food and other consumable items . The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow , materials handling , production , packaging , inventory , transportation , warehousing , and often security . In military science , logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy , since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless . Military logistics was already practiced in the ancient world and as modern military have a significant need for logistics solutions , advanced implementations have been developed . In military logistics , logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed . Logistics management is the part of supply chain management and supply chain engineering that plans , implements , and controls the efficient , effective forward , and reverse flow and storage of goods , services , and related information between point of origin and point of consumption to meet customer 's requirements . The complexity of logistics can be modeled , analyzed , visualized , and optimized by dedicated simulation software . The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields . A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician",

  "/wiki/Aviation": "Aviation or air transport are the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry . Aircraft includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing types , morphable wings , wing-less lifting bodies , as well as lighter-than-air craft such as balloons and airships . Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon , an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy . Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896 ; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s . Since that time , aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world",

  "/wiki/Furniture": "Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating ( e.g. , chairs , stools , and sofas ) , eating ( tables ) , and sleeping ( e.g. , beds ) . Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work ( as horizontal surfaces above the ground , such as tables and desks ) , or to store things ( e.g. , cupboards and shelves ) . Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art . In addition to furniture 's functional role , it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose . It can be made from many materials , including metal , plastic , and wood . Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture . People have been using natural objects , such as tree stumps , rocks and moss , as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation . Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago , people began constructing and carving their own furniture , using wood , stone , and animal bones . Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia , depicting the goddess on a throne . The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland , and includes cupboards , dressers and beds all constructed from stone . Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt . This era saw constructed wooden pieces , including stools and tables , sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory",
  "/wiki/Home_appliance": "Home appliances , also known as domestic appliances , are electrical machines that help in household functions such as cooking , cleaning and food preservation . They are divided into the three classifications : small appliances , major appliances , or white goods , and consumer electronics , or brown goods in the United Kingdom . The division is also recognized in the maintenance and repair of these types of products . Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills ( which get more complex with time , such as going from a soldering iron to a hot-air soldering station ) , while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them",

  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80 % of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80 % or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name",
  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry",
  "/wiki/Healthcare": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization",
  "/wiki/Hospitals": "A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment . The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital , which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness . A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region , with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care . Specialized hospitals include trauma centers , rehabilitation hospitals , children 's hospitals , seniors ' ( geriatric ) hospitals , and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment ( see psychiatric hospital ) and certain disease categories . Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals . Hospitals are classified as general , specialty , or government depending on the sources of income received . A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses . A medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic . Hospitals have a range of departments ( e.g . surgery and urgent care ) and specialist units such as cardiology . Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units .

  "/wiki/Platinum": "Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78 . It is a dense , malleable , ductile , highly unreactive , precious , silverish-white transition metal . Its name is derived from the Spanish term platino , meaning little silver . Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements . It has six naturally occurring isotopes . It is one of the rarer elements in Earth 's crust , with an average abundance of approximately 5 \u03bcg/kg . It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in South Africa , which accounts for 80 % of the world production . Because of its scarcity in Earth 's crust , only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , and given its important uses , it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity . Platinum is one of the least reactive metals . It has remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and is therefore considered a noble metal . Consequently , platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum . Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers , it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products",

  "/wiki/Transport": "Transport or transportation is the movement of humans , animals and goods from one location to another . In other words , the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a point B. Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ) , water , cable , pipeline and space . The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles and operations . Transport enables trade between people , which is essential for the development of civilizations . Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations , including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals , refueling depots ( including fueling docks and fuel stations ) and seaports . Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance . Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft and aircraft . Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated , and the procedures set for this purpose , including financing , legalities , and policies . In the transport industry , operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private , depending on the country and mode . Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services , or private . Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items . Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land",
