It occupies a two hundred and fifty meter stretch of Omotesand\u014d , a shopping and ( previously ) residential road in Aoyama . It was designed by Tadao Ando , and contains over 130 shops and 38 apartments . The construction of Omotesando Hills , built at a cost of $ 330 million , has been marked by controversy . The building replaced the Bauhaus-inspired D\u014djunkai Aoyama Apartments , which had been built in 1927 after the 1923 Kant\u014d earthquake . The destruction of the apartments again raised questions about Japan 's interest in preserving historic buildings . A small section of the old apartments is reconstructed in the South-East part of the new complex . Minoru Mori noted that there had been resistance from local landowners to the use of Ando as architect , saying that they were concerned that his buildings were too fashionable for the area . Regarding the construction , Ando said , It 's not Tadao Ando as an architect who has decided to rebuild and make shops , it was the owners themselves who wanted it to be new housing and to get some value with shops below . My task was how to do it in the best way .",
