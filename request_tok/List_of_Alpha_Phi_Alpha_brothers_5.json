  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States .

Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",

In the 1930s , his orchestra toured in Europe . Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz , Ellington embraced the phrase beyond category as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz . Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington 's orchestra , such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges , are considered to be among the best players in the idiom . Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz . Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades . A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format , Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions ; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy , with many of his pieces having become standards . Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen , for example Juan Tizol 's Caravan , and Perdido , which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz . In the early 1940s , Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn , whom he called his writing and arranging companion . With Strayhorn , he composed many extended compositions , or suites , as well as additional short pieces .

  "/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",
  "/wiki/Shai": "Shai ( also spelt Sai , occasionally Shay , and in Greek , Psais ) was the deification of the concept of fate in Egyptian mythology . As a concept , with no particular reason for associating one gender over another , Shai was sometimes considered female , rather than the more usual understanding of being male , in which circumstance Shai was referred to as Shait ( simply the feminine form of the name ) . His name reflects his function , as it means ( that which is ) ordained . As the god of fate , it was said that he determined the span of each man 's life , and was present at the judgement of the soul of the deceased in duat . In consequence , he was sometimes identified as the husband of Mesenet , goddess of birth , or , in later years , of Renenutet , who assigned the Ren , and had become considered goddess of fortune . Because of the power associated in the concept , Akhenaten , in introducing monotheism , said that Shai was an attribute of Aten , whereas Ramses II claimed to be lord of Shai ( i.e . lord of fate ) . During Ptolemaic Egypt , Shai , as god of fate , was identified with the Greek god Agathodaemon , who was the god of fortune telling . Thus , since Agathodaemon was considered to be a serpent , and the word Shai was also the Egyptian word for pig , in the Hellenic period , Shai was sometimes depicted as a serpent-headed pig , known to Egyptologists as the Shai animal .",

  "/wiki/Swing_(genre)": "Swing music , or simply swing , is a form of popular jazz music developed in the United States that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s . The name swing came from the 'swing feel ' where the emphasis is on the off-beat or weaker pulse in the music . Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement . The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946 , a period known as the swing era . The verb to swing is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive . Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong , Count Basie , Cab Calloway , Jimmy Dorsey , Tommy Dorsey , Duke Ellington , Benny Goodman , Woody Herman , Harry James , Louis Jordan , Glenn Miller , Louis Prima , and Artie Shaw . Swing has roots in the 1920s as larger dance music ensembles began using new styles of written arrangements incorporating rhythmic innovations pioneered by Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines . A typical song played in swing style would feature a strong , anchoring rhythm section in support of more loosely tied wind and brass . The most common style consisted of theme choruses and choruses with improvised solos within the framework of his bandmates playing support . Swing music began to decline in popularity during World War II because of several factors . Swing influenced the later styles of traditional pop music , jump blues , and bebop jazz . Swing music saw a revival in the late 1950s and 1960s with the resurgent Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras , and with pop vocalists such as Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole .",
