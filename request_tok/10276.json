  "/wiki/Bill_Buckner": "William Joseph Buckner ( December 14 , 1949 - May 27 , 2019 ) was an American professional baseball first baseman and left fielder , who played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for five teams from 1969 through 1990 , including the Chicago Cubs , the Los Angeles Dodgers , and Boston Red Sox . Beginning his career as an outfielder with the Dodgers , he helped the team to the 1974 pennant with a .314 batting average , but a serious ankle injury the next year eventually led to his trade to the Cubs prior to the 1977 season . The Cubs moved Buckner to first base , and he won the National League ( NL ) batting title with a .324 mark in 1980 . He was named to the All-Star team in 1981 as he led the major leagues in doubles . After setting a major league record for first basemen with 159 assists in 1982 , Buckner surpassed that total with 161 in 1983 while again leading the NL in doubles , before feuds with team management over a loss of playing time resulted in his being traded to the Red Sox in the middle of the 1984 season . During the 1985 season , Buckner emerged as the Red Sox stalwart first baseman , starting all 162 games and shattering his own big league record with 184 assists . Toward the end of the 1986 season , he was hobbled by leg injuries and struggled throughout the playoffs . Buckners tenth-inning error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets remains one of the most memorable plays in baseball history ; it was long considered part of a curse on the Red Sox that kept them from winning the World Series , and led to years of fan anger and public mockery that Buckner handled graciously before being embraced by Red Sox fans again after their 2004 World Series victory . After spending his last few seasons with the California Angels , Kansas City Royals , and a second stint with the Red Sox , Buckner became the 21st player in MLB history to play in four decades , ending his career with 2,715 hits and 498 doubles , having batted over .300 seven times with three seasons of 100 runs batted in ( RBI ) . Never striking out 40 times in a season , he finished with the fifth-lowest strikeout rate among players whose careers began after 1950 . Buckner led his league in assists four times , with his 1985 mark remaining the American League ( AL ) record , and retired with the fourth-most assists by a first baseman ( 1,351 ) in major league history , despite not playing the position regularly until he was 27 years old . After retiring as a player , he became a real estate developer in Idaho , and later coached a number of Minor League Baseball ( MiLB ) teams before leaving baseball in 2014 .",

The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 .
