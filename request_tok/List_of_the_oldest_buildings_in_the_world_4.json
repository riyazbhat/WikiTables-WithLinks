Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018 ; Athens , the nation 's capital , is its largest city , followed by Thessaloniki . Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula , Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest , North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north , and Turkey to the northeast . The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland , the Ionian Sea to the west , the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring many islands , of which 227 are inhabited . Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous , with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions : Macedonia , Central Greece , the Peloponnese , Thessaly , Epirus , the Aegean Islands ( including the Dodecanese and Cyclades ) , Thrace , Crete , and the Ionian Islands . Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , Western drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century B.C. , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire , which adopted the Greek language and culture .",

The tell includes two phases of use , believed to be of a social or ritual nature by site discoverer and excavator Klaus Schmidt , dating back to the 10th-8th millennium BCE . During the first phase , belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) , circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected - the world 's oldest known megaliths . More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys . Each pillar has a height of up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) and weighs up to 10 tons . They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the bedrock . In the second phase , belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( PPNB ) , the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime . The site was abandoned after the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( PPNB ) . Younger structures date to classical times . The details of the structure 's function remain a mystery .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I .

The European Union ( EU ) also has adopted this usage . The term Occupied Palestinian Territory was used by the UN and other international organizations between October 1999 and December 2012 to refer to areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority . The EU had utilized a parallel term Palestinian Authority territories occasionally during the same period . The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) referred to the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , as the Occupied Palestinian Territory and this term was used as the legal definition by the ICJ in the ruling in July 2004 . The West Bank and Gaza Strip had been ruled by Jordan and Egypt , respectively , since the 1948 war until 1967 . Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War of 1967 and has since maintained control . In 1980 , Israel officially absorbed East Jerusalem and has proclaimed the whole of Jerusalem to be its capital . The inclusion , though never formally amounting to legal annexation , was condemned internationally and declared null and void by the United Nations Security Council . The Palestinian National Authority , the United Nations , the international legal and humanitarian bodies and the international community regard East Jerusalem as part of the West Bank , and consequently a part of the Palestinian territories .

As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

  "/wiki/Balkans": "The Balkans /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0lk\u0259nz/ BAWL-k\u0259nz , also known as the Balkan Peninsula , is a geographic area in Southeast Europe with various definitions and meanings , including geopolitical and historical . The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea coast . The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest , the Ionian Sea in the southwest , the Aegean Sea in the south , the Turkish Straits in the east , and the Black Sea in the northeast . The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined . The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala , 2,925 metres ( 9,596 ft ) , in the Rila mountain range , Bulgaria . The concept of the Balkan peninsula was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808 , who mistakenly considered the Balkan Mountains the dominant mountain system of Southeast Europe spanning from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea . The term of Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for Rumelia ( European Turkey ) in the 19th century , the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe . It had a geopolitical rather than a geographical definition , further promoted during the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century . The definition of the Balkan peninsula 's natural borders do not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula and hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan peninsula , while scholars usually discuss the Balkans as a region . The term has acquired a stigmatized and pejorative meaning related to the process of Balkanization , and hence the preferred alternative term used for the region is Southeast Europe .",
  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",
  "/wiki/Pottery": "Pottery is the process of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials , which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard , durable form .

The definition of pottery used by the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) , is all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed , except technical , structural , and refractory products . In archaeology , especially of ancient and prehistoric periods , pottery often means vessels only , and figures etc . of the same material are called terracottas . Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery , but this is dubious .",
  "/wiki/Iron_Age": "The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity . It was preceded by the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Chalcolithic ) and the Bronze Age . The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East , and , by analogy , also to other parts of the Old World . The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration . It is defined by archaeological convention , and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture ; rather , the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread . For example , Tutankhamun 's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age . In the Ancient Near East , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse , in the 12th century BC . The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia . Its further spread to Central Asia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe is somewhat delayed , and Northern Europe is reached still later , by about 500 BC . The Iron Age is taken to end , also by convention , with the beginning of the historiographical record . This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record ; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC ( considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus ) is usually taken as a cut-off date , and in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age . The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD , with the beginning of the Viking Age .",

Sitalces enlarged his kingdom by successful wars , and it soon comprised the whole territory from Abdera in the south to the mouths of the Danube in the north , and from the Black Sea in the east to the sources of the Struma in the west . At the commencement of the Peloponnesian war Sitalces entered into alliance with the Athenians , and in 429 BC he invaded Macedon ( then ruled by Perdiccas II ) with a vast army that included 150,000 warriors from independent Thracian tribes ( such as the Dii ) and Paeonian tribes ( Agrianes , Laeaeans ) . [ dubious - discuss ] He was obliged to retire through failure of provisions . Sitalces was killed in 424 by the Thracian Triballi . He was succeeded on the Odrysian throne by Seuthes . Sitalk Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands , Antarctica is named for Sitalces .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia .

  "/wiki/Tumulus": "A tumulus ( plural tumuli ) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves . Tumuli are also known as barrows , burial mounds or kurgans , and may be found throughout much of the world . A cairn , which is a mound of stones built for various purposes , may also originally have been a tumulus . Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape . In this respect , a long barrow is a long tumulus , usually constructed on top of several burials , such as passage graves . A round barrow is a round tumulus , also commonly constructed on top of burials . The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range ; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape . The method of inhumation may involve a dolmen , a cist , a mortuary enclosure , a mortuary house , or a chamber tomb . Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe . The word tumulus is Latin for 'mound ' or 'small hill ' , which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *teuh2- with extended zero grade *tum- , 'to bulge , swell ' also found in tomb , tumor , tumescent , thumb , thigh , and thousand .",

  "/wiki/Ba`alat_Gebal": "Baalat Gebal , 'Lady of Byblos ' , was the goddess of the city of Byblos , Phoenicia in ancient times . She was sometimes known to the Greeks as Baaltis or Atargatis . Baalat Gebal was generally identified with the pan-Semitic goddess Ashtart ( Astarte ) and , like Ashtart , equated with the Greek goddess Aphrodite . However , Sanchuniathon presents Baalat Gebal as a sister of Ashtart and Asherah , and calls Baalat Gebal by the name Dione , meaning that he identified her either with Asherah or with the mother of Greek Aphrodite , the Titan goddess Dione . According to Sanchuniathon , Baaltis/Dione , like Asherah and Ashtart , was a sister and wife of 'El . He states that she bore daughters to El and that it was El who gave the city of Byblos to her . Baalat Gebal was distinguished in iconography from Ashtart or other aspects of Ashtart or similar goddesses by two , tall , upright feathers in her headdress . The temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos was built around 2700 BC . Dedications from Egyptians begin appearing from the second to the 6th Egyptian dynasties . Two of these inscriptions equate Baalat Gebal with the Egyptian goddess Hathor . Frank Moore Cross writes that at Sinai Baalat seems to have referred to Hathor and possibly to Qud\u0161u ( see Qetesh ) , who is Asherah .",

It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south , while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea . Lebanon 's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity . At just 10,452 km2 ( 4,036 mi2 ) , it is the smallest recognized sovereign state on the mainland Asian continent . [ nb 4 ] The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years , predating recorded history . Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms , a maritime culture that flourished for almost three thousand years ( c. 3200-539 BC ) . In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome . The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era .",

This pharaoh was the second of the Third Dynasty of Ancient Egypt , which reigned over Egypt circa 2686-2613 BC and is usually placed at the beginning of the Old Kingdom of Egypt . Many historians believe that the third dynasty played an important role in the transition from Early Dynastic Period of Egypt to the Age of the Pyramids . The pyramid may be visited , but the public is not allowed access to the base and substructures . Sekhemkhet Djoserty was also the successor to the better-known pharaoh Djoser , who was buried in his famous step pyramid at Saqqara . The buried pyramid was originally modelled after Djoser 's step pyramid and is located several hundred metres southwest . It is also arguable that the pyramid of Sekhemkhet was originally designed to surpass the step pyramid of Djoser but barely made it above ground level and hence was given the name the Buried Pyramid . Its incompletion is thought to have been due to Sekhemkhet 's short reign as ruler , which was approximately six years .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Monolith": "A monolith is a geological feature consisting of a single massive stone or rock , such as some mountains , or a single large piece of rock placed as , or within , a monument or building . [ citation needed ] Erosion usually exposes the geological formations , which are often made of very hard and solid igneous or metamorphic rock . In architecture , the term has considerable overlap with megalith , which is normally used for prehistory , and may be used in the contexts of rock-cut architecture that remains attached to solid rock , as in monolithic church , or for exceptionally large stones such as obelisks , statues , monolithic columns or large architraves , that may have been moved a considerable distance after quarrying . It may also be used of large glacial erratics moved by natural forces .

Khafra was the builder of the second largest pyramid of Giza . The view held by modern Egyptology at large continues to be that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500 BC for Khafra . Not much is known about Khafra , except from the historical reports of Herodotus , writing 2,000 years after his life , who describes him as a cruel and heretical ruler who kept the Egyptian temples closed after Khufu had sealed them .",

The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries .

After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle , David is anointed as King . David conquers Jerusalem , taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city , and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul . As king , David commits adultery with Bathsheba , leading him to arrange the death of her husband Uriah the Hittite . Because of this sin , God denies David the opportunity to build the temple , and his son Absalom tries to overthrow him . David flees Jerusalem during Absalom 's rebellion , but after Absalom 's death he returns to the city to rule Israel . Before his peaceful death , he chooses his son Solomon as successor . He is honored in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and the forefather of a future Messiah , and many psalms are ascribed to him . Historians of the Ancient Near East agree that David probably existed around 1000 BCE , but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure ."
