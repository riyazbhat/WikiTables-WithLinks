It is located 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) from the modern coastline of the Aegean Sea on a promontory on the north side of the river Caicus ( modern-day Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay ) and northwest of the modern city of Bergama , Turkey . During the Hellenistic period , it became the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon under the Attalid dynasty in 281-133 BC , who transformed it into one of the major cultural centres of the Greek world . Many remains of its impressive monuments can still be seen and especially the outstanding masterpiece of the Pergamon Altar . Pergamon was the northernmost of the seven churches of Asia cited in the New Testament Book of Revelation . The city is centered around a 335-metre-high ( 1,099 ft ) mesa of andesite which formed its acropolis . This mesa falls away sharply on the north , west , and east sides , but three natural terraces on the south side provide a route up to the top . To the west of the acropolis , the Selinus River ( modern Bergama\u00e7ay ) flows through the city , while the Ketios river ( modern Kestel\u00e7ay ) passes by to the east",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace )",

The Bijapur Sultanate 's borders changed considerably throughout its history . Its northern boundary remained relatively stable , straddling contemporary Southern Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka .

The bright yellow building completed in 1937 has a 26m high central dome , with four tall arch-roofed arms branching out diagonally across the block , creating vast hallways housing countless stalls and all kinds of goods . Initially designed by city architect Jean Desbois , construction works were supervised by French architect Louis Chauchon . When it first opened in 1937 , it was said to be the biggest market in Asia ; today it still operates as a market . After Phnom Penh became the capital of the French protectorate of Cambodia within French Indochina in 1867 , the population grew enormously and the French set about creating a spacious modern city . The decision to build a market dates back to the end of the 1920s in response to the increase in the population to 90,000 inhabitants . It was decided to build it on a marshland in the center of the Chinatown of the time , but the project did not start until 1934 because of the turmoil of the Great Depression . It was designed by Jean Desbois ( 1891 Cherbourg -1971 Lorient ) , the architect of the city from 1931-37 , and its implementation will be supervised by Louis Chauchon ( 1875 - 1945 Saigon ) and the ingenue Wladimir Kandaouroff . The works are entrusted to the Indochinese Society of Studies and Construction which has already built the markets of Battambang and Cholon . The marsh was drained and work began in August 1935 and was completed in 22 months later ; the market was inaugurated by King Sisowath Monivong in September 1937 .

  "/wiki/Singapore": "Singapore ( /\u02c8s\u026a\u014b ( \u0261 ) \u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Singapore , is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia . Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25 % since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946"
