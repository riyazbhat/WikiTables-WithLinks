  "/wiki/Alexandra_of_Denmark": "Alexandra of Denmark ( Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia ; 1 December 1844 - 20 November 1925 ) was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress consort of India as the wife of King Edward VII . Alexandra 's family had been relatively obscure until 1852 , when her father , Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg , was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his distant cousin , Frederick VII of Denmark . At the age of sixteen , she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward , Prince of Wales , the heir apparent of Queen Victoria . They married eighteen months later in 1863 , the same year her father became King Christian IX of Denmark and her brother was appointed as King George I of Greece . She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901 , the longest anyone has ever held that title , and became generally popular ; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women . Largely excluded from wielding any political power , she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband 's family to favour Greek and Danish interests . Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work . On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 , Albert Edward became king-emperor as Edward VII , with Alexandra as queen-empress . She held the status until Edward 's death in 1910 . She greatly distrusted her nephew Wilhelm II , German Emperor , and supported her son George V during the First World War , in which Britain and its allies fought Germany .",

  "/wiki/Edward_VII": "Edward VII ( Albert Edward ; 9 November 1841 - 6 May 1910 ) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910 . The eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe . He was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne for almost 60 years . During the long reign of his mother , he was largely excluded from political power , and came to personify the fashionable , leisured elite . He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties , and represented Britain on visits abroad . His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes , but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother . As king , Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War . He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised . He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries , especially France , for which he was popularly called Peacemaker , but his relationship with his nephew , the German Emperor Wilhelm II , was poor . The Edwardian era , which covered Edward 's reign and was named after him , coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society , including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism . He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911 , which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords .",

  "/wiki/Altab_Ali": "Altab Ali Park is a small park on Adler Street , White Church Lane and Whitechapel Road , London E1 . Formerly known as St Mary 's Park , it is the site of the old 14th-century white church , St Mary Matfelon , from which the area of Whitechapel gets its name . St Mary 's was heavily bombed during The Blitz in 1940 , all that remains of the old church is the floor plan and a few graves . Included among those buried on the site are Richard Parker , Richard Brandon , Sir John Cass , and Sir Jeffrey Dunstan , Mayor of Garratt . The park was renamed Altab Ali Park in 1998 in memory of Altab Ali , a 25-year-old British Bangladeshi clothing worker , who was murdered on 4 May 1978 in Adler Street by three teenage boys as he walked home from work . Ali 's murder was one of the many racist attacks that came to characterise the East End at that time . At the entrance to the park is an arch created by David Petersen , developed as a memorial to Altab Ali and other victims of racist attacks . The arch incorporates a complex Bengali-style pattern , meant to show the merging of different cultures in East London . Along the path down the centre of the park are letters spelling out The shade of my tree is offered to those who come and go fleetingly , a fragment of a poem by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore . The Shaheed Minar , which commemorates the Bengali Language Movement , stands in the southwest corner of Altab Ali Park .

A makeshift monument was erected on 23 February by students of Dhaka medical college and other educational institutions , but soon demolished on 24 February by the Pakistani police force . The Language Movement gained momentum , and after a long struggle , Bengali gained official status in Pakistan ( with Urdu ) in 1956 . To commemorate the dead , the Shaheed Minar was designed and built by Bangladeshi sculptors Hamidur Rahman in collaboration with Novera Ahmed . Construction was delayed by martial law , but the monument was finally completed in 1963 , and stood until the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 , when it was demolished completely during Operation Searchlight . After Bangladesh gained independence later that year , it was rebuilt . It was expanded in 1983 .

  "/wiki/Hamish_Mackie": "Hamish Mackie ( born October 1973 ) is a British wildlife sculptor who works in bronze , silver and any other castable metal using the lost-wax casting method . He is considered to be one of the world 's foremost wildlife sculptors . Largely self-taught , Mackie captures his subjects - ranging from livestock to birds via wild animals - by observation in a natural environment , taking detailed photographs and sometimes modelling in plasticine . From this he creates a highly accurate anatomical core covered with a loose , almost impressionistic skin that captures the essence of the animal 's personality . He has won numerous commissions including works for Jilly Cooper , Charles Saatchi , Ronnie Wood ( private ) and RSPCA , National Trust , Woburn Abbey , Merrill Lynch , Hiscox and most recently the Berkeley Group Holdings ( public ) . He has travelled to places including Antarctica , the Falkland Islands , Australia , across Africa , and the United Arab Emirates in search of subjects ."
