  "/wiki/Prefix": "A prefix is an affix which is placed before the stem of a word . Adding it to the beginning of one word changes it into another word . For example , when the prefix un- is added to the word happy , it creates the word unhappy . Particularly in the study of languages , a prefix is also called a preformative , because it alters the form of the words to which it is affixed . Prefixes , like other affixes , can be either inflectional , creating a new form of the word with the same basic meaning and same lexical category ( but playing a different role in the sentence ) , or derivational , creating a new word with a new semantic meaning and sometimes also a different lexical category . Prefixes , like all other affixes , are usually bound morphemes . In English , there are no inflectional prefixes ; English uses suffixes instead for that purpose . The word prefix is itself made up of the stem fix ( meaning attach , in this case ) , and the prefix pre- ( meaning before ) , both of which are derived from Latin roots",
  "/wiki/Boreoeutheria": "Boreoeutheria ( synonymous with Boreotheria ) ( from Greek \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 , Boreas the greek god of north wind , \u03b5\u1f50- , eu- good , right and \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd , th\u0113r\u00edon beast hence northern true beasts ) is a clade ( magnorder ) of placental mammals which is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria ( most hoofed mammals , most pawed carnivores , and several other groups ) and Euarchontoglires ( Supraprimates ) . It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses , as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data . [ citation needed ] Placental mammals outside of this clade are the clades Xenarthra ( sloths and their close relatives ) and Afrotheria ( elephants and their close relatives ) . The earliest known fossils belonging to this group date to about 65 million years ago , shortly after the K-Pg extinction event , though molecular data suggest they may have originated earlier , during the Cretaceous period . With a few exceptions [ a ] male animals in the clade have a scrotum . The sub-clade Scrotifera was named after this feature",
  "/wiki/Euarchontoglires": "Euarchontoglires ( synonymous with Supraprimates ) is a clade and a superorder of mammals , the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups : rodents , lagomorphs , treeshrews , colugos and primates",
  "/wiki/Parareptilia": "Parareptilia ( at the side of reptiles ) is a subclass or clade of reptiles which is variously defined as an extinct group of primitive anapsids , or a more cladistically correct alternative to Anapsida . Whether the term is valid depends on the phylogenetic position of turtles , whose relationships to other reptilian groups are still uncertain",
  "/wiki/Euarchonta": "The Euarchonta are a proposed grandorder of mammals containing four orders : the Scandentia or treeshrews , the Dermoptera or colugos , the extinct Plesiadapiformes , and the Primates . The term Euarchonta ( Waddell et al . 1999 , meaning true ancestors ) appeared in 1999 , when molecular evidence suggested that the morphology-based Archonta should be trimmed down to exclude Chiroptera ( Waddell et al . 1999b ) . Further DNA sequence analyses ( Madsen et al . 2001 , Murphy et al. , 2001 Waddell et al . 2001 ) supported the Euarchonta hypothesis . Despite multiple papers pointing out that some mitochondrial sequences showed unusual properties ( particularly murid rodents and hedgehogs ) and were likely distorting the overall tree ( Sullivan and Swofford 1997 , Waddell et al . 1999c ) , and despite Waddell et al . ( 2001 ) showing near total congruence of mtDNA-based and nuclear-based trees when such sequences were excluded , some authors continued to produce misleading trees ( Arnason et al. , 2002 ) . A study investigating retrotransposon presence/absence data has claimed strong support for Euarchonta ( Kriegs et al. , 2007 ) . Some interpretations of the molecular data link Primates and Dermoptera in a clade ( mirorder ) known as Primatomorpha , which is the sister of Scandentia",
  "/wiki/Primatomorpha": "The Primatomorpha are a mirorder of mammals containing two extant orders : the Dermoptera or colugos and the Primates ( Plesiadapiformes , Strepsirrhini , Haplorhini ) . The term Primatomorpha first appeared in the general scientific literature in 1991 ( K.C . Beard ) and 1992 ( Kalandadze , Rautian ) . Major DNA sequence analyses of predominantly nuclear sequences ( Murphy et al. , 2001 ) support the Euarchonta hypothesis , while a major study investigating mitochondrial sequences supports a different tree topology ( Arnason et al. , 2002 ) . A study investigating retrotransposon presence/absence data has claimed strong support for Euarchonta ( Kriegs et al. , 2007 ) . Some interpretations of the molecular data link Primates and Dermoptera in a clade ( mirorder ) known as Primatomorpha , which is the sister of Scandentia . Primates probably split from the Dermoptera sister group 79.6 million years ago during the Cretaceous . Other interpretations link the Dermoptera and Scandentia together in a group called Sundatheria as the sister group of the primates . Some recent studies place Scandentia as sister of the Glires , invalidating Euarchonta",
  "/wiki/Primates": "A primate ( /\u02c8pra\u026ame\u026at/ ( listen ) PRY-mayt ) ( from Latin primat- , from primus : prime , first rank ) is a eutherian mammal constituting the taxonomic order Primates . Primates arose 85-55 million years ago first as plesiadapiformes from small terrestrial mammals ( Primatomorpha ) , which adapted to living in the trees of tropical forests : many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment , including large brains , visual acuity , color vision , altered shoulder girdle , and dextrous hands . Primates range in size from Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur , which weighs 30 g ( 1 oz ) , to the eastern gorilla , weighing over 200 kg ( 440 lb ) . There are 190-448 species of living primates , depending on which classification is used . New primate species continue to be discovered : over 25 species were described in the first decade of the 2000s , and eleven since 2010 . Primates are divided into two distinct suborders ( see diagram under History of terminology ) . The first suborder is called strepsirrhines ( from Greek 'wet-nosed ' ) , which contains lemurs , galagos , and lorisids . These primates can be found throughout Africa , Madagascar , India , and Southeast Asia . The colloquial names of species ending in -nosed refer to the rhinarium of the primate . The second suborder is called haplorhines , which contains dry-nosed primates ( from Greek 'simple-nosed ' ) in the tarsier , monkey , and ape clades . The last of these groups includes humans . Simians ( the infraorder called Simiiformes from the Greek word simos , meaning 'flat-nosed ' ) refer to monkeys and apes , which can be classified as Old World monkeys and apes under the infraorder of catarrhines ( from Greek 'narrow nosed ' ) or as New World monkeys under the infraorder of platyrrhines ( from Greek 'flat-nosed ' )",
  "/wiki/Procolophonomorpha": "Procolophonomorpha is an order or clade containing most parareptiles . Many papers have applied various definitions to the name , though most of these definitions have since been considered synonymous with modern parareptile clades such as Ankyramorpha and Procolophonia . The current definition of Procolophonomorpha , as defined by Modesto , Scott , & Reisz ( 2009 ) , is that of as a stem-based group containing Procolophon and all taxa more closely related to it than to Milleretta . It constitutes a diverse assemblage that includes a number of lizard-like forms , as well as more diverse types such as the pareiasaurs . Lee 1995 , 1996 , 1997 argues that turtles evolved from pareiasaurs , but this view is no longer considered likely . Rieppel and deBraga 1996 and deBraga and Rieppel , 1997 argue that turtles evolved from sauropterygians , and there is both molecular and fossil ( Pappochelys ) evidence for the origin of turtles among diapsid reptiles",
  "/wiki/Haplorrhini": "Haplorhini ( the haplorhines or the dry-nosed primates ; the Greek name means simple-nosed ) is a suborder of primates containing the tarsiers and the simians ( Simiiformes or anthropoids ) , as sister of the Strepsirrhini ( moist-nosed ) . The name is sometimes spelled Haplorrhini . The simians include catarrhines ( Old World monkeys and apes including humans ) , and the platyrrhines ( New World monkeys ) . The extinct omomyids , which are considered to be the most basal haplorhines , are believed to be more closely related to the tarsiers than to other haplorhines . The exact relationship is not yet fully established - Williams , Kay and Kirk ( 2010 ) prefer the view that tarsiers and simians share a common ancestor , and that common ancestor shares a common ancestor with the omomyids , citing evidence from analysis by Bajpal et al . in 2008 ; but they also note two other possibilities - that tarsiers are directly descended from omomyids , with simians being a separate line , or that both simians and tarsiers are descended from omomyids . Haplorhines share a number of derived features that distinguish them from the strepsirrhine wet-nosed primates ( whose Greek name means curved nose ) , the other suborder of primates from which they diverged some 63 million years ago [ citation needed ] . The haplorhines , including tarsiers , have all lost the function of the terminal enzyme that manufactures Vitamin C , while the strepsirrhines , like most other orders of mammals , have retained this enzyme . Genetically , five short interspersed nuclear elements ( SINEs ) are common to all haplorhines whilst absent in strepsirrhines . The haplorhine upper lip , which has replaced the ancestral rhinarium found in strepsirrhines , is not directly connected to their nose or gum , allowing a large range of facial expressions . Their brain-to-body mass ratio is significantly greater than the strepsirrhines , and their primary sense is vision . Haplorhines have a postorbital plate , unlike the postorbital bar found in strepsirrhines",
  "/wiki/Procolophonia": "The Procolophonia are a suborder of herbivorous reptiles that lived from the Middle Permian till the end of the Triassic period . They were originally included as a suborder of the Cotylosauria ( later renamed Captorhinida Carroll 1988 ) but are now considered a clade of Parareptilia . They are closely related to other generally lizard-like Permian reptiles such as the Millerettidae , Bolosauridae , Acleistorhinidae , and Lanthanosuchidae , all of which are included under the Anapsida or Parareptiles ( as opposed to the Eureptilia )",
  "/wiki/Simiiformes": "The simians or anthropoids or higher primates are an infraorder ( Simiiformes ) of primates containing the parvorders Platyrrhini and Catarrhini , which consists of the superfamilies Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea ( including the genus Homo ) . The simians are sister to the tarsiers , together forming the haplorhines . The radiation occurred about 60 million years ago ( during the Cenozoic era ) . 40 million years ago , simians from Afro-Arabia colonized South America , giving rise to the New World monkeys . The remaining simians ( catarrhines ) split 25 million years ago into Old World monkeys and apes",
  "/wiki/Hallucicrania": "Ankyramorpha ( anchor forms ) is an extinct clade of procolophonomorph parareptiles which lived between the early Cisuralian epoch ( middle Sakmarian stage ) to the latest Triassic period ( latest Rhaetian stage ) of Africa , Antarctica , Asia , Australia , Europe , North America and South America . This clade was named in a 1996 parareptile study by Michael deBraga and Robert R. Reisz . They provided the name Ankyramorpha for a newly recognized clade encompassing the most recent common ancestor of Procolophonia and Lanthanosuchoidea and all its descendants , and this clade name sees continued use among modern parareptile studies . A similar name , Hallucicrania , was provided in an earlier 1995 study by Michael S. Y. Lee , who defined it as the node-based taxon formed by the most recent common ancestor of lanthanosuchids and pareiasauroids ( pareiasaurs + Sclerosaurus ) , and all its descendants . Unlike Ankyramorpha , which explicitly included procolophonoids , Hallucicrania was originally designed to exclude procolophonoids , which Lee 's analysis argued to have split off prior to the divergence between lanthanosuchids and pareiasaurs . Nevertheless , purely considering the taxa encompassed by their definitions , Hallucicrania and Ankyramorpha refer to an identical grouping . The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of MacDougall and Reisz ( 2014 ) and shows the placement of Ankyramorpha within Parareptilia . Relationships within emboldened terminal clades are not shown",
  "/wiki/Catarrhini": "The Catarrhini or catarrhine monkeys or Old World anthropoids are the sister group to the New World monkeys , the Platyrrhini . The Platyrrhini emerged within monkeys by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia ( the Old World ) , likely by ocean . With respect to the ones that stayed behind , Geoffroy in 1812 grouped the apes ( hominoidea ) and the Cercopithecoidea together and established the name Catarrhini , Old World monkeys , or singes de l'Ancien continent . Darwin in the late 19th century imagined correctly that apes were the sister to the Cercopithecoidea . There has been some resistance to directly designate apes ( and thus humans ) as monkeys despite the scientific evidence , [ citation needed ] so Old World monkey may be taken to mean the Cercopithecoidea or the Catarrhini . That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon in the 18th century . The apes are further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes , consisting of the orangutans , gorillas , chimpanzees and humans . The Catarrhini are all native to Africa and Asia . Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines"
