The town 's importance grew in the Middle Ages as the Old Town developed , but it languished in the early modern period , affected by foreign attacks , storms , a suffering economy and a declining population . Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France . The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses . In the Georgian era , Brighton developed as a fashionable seaside resort , encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent , later King George IV , who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era . Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841 , becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London . Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era , including the Metropole Hotel ( now Hilton ) Grand Hotel , the West Pier , and the Brighton Palace Pier . The town continued to grow into the 20th century , expanding to incorporate more areas into the town 's boundaries before joining Hove to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove in 1997 , which was granted city status in 2000 .",

The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",
