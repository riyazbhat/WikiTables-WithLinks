It had a number of distinguished leaders , most of them old Congressmen , for example , C. Rajagopalachari , Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu , Minoo Masani , N.G . Ranga , Darshan Singh Pheruman , Udham Singh Nagoke and K.M . Munshi . Right-wing groups and parties had existed earlier at the local and regional levels , but Swatantras formation was the first attempt to bring these highly fragmented right-wing forces together under the umbrella of a single party . The provocation was the left turn which the Congress took at Avadi and the Nagpur Resolutions . Swatantra stood for a market-based economy with the Licence Raj dismantled , although it opposed laissez faire policies . The party was thus favoured by some traders and industrialists , but at the state-level its leadership was dominated by the traditional privileged classes such as zamindars ( feudal landlords ) and erstwhile princes . Located on the right of the Indian political spectrum Swatantra was not a communal party ; its membership was not restricted on the basis of religion , unlike the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh . In 1960 , Rajagopalachari and his colleagues drafted a 21-point manifesto detailing why Swatantra had to be formed , even though they were hitherto Congressmen and associates of Nehru during the struggle for independence . The Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was highly critical of Swatantra , dubbing the party as belonging to the middle ages of lords , castles and zamindars",
