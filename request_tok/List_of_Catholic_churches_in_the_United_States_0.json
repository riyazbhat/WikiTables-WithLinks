Facilities for African Americans and Native Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to the facilities for white Americans ; sometimes , there were no facilities for people of color . As a body of law , Jim Crow institutionalized economic , educational , and social disadvantages for African Americans and other people of color living in the South .
