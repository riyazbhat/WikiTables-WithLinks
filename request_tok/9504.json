  "/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription": "The Royal Thai General System of Transcription ( RTGS ) is the official system for rendering Thai words in the Latin alphabet .

The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Banana": "A banana is an edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa . In some countries , bananas used for cooking may be called plantains , distinguishing them from dessert bananas . The fruit is variable in size , color , and firmness , but is usually elongated and curved , with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind , which may be green , yellow , red , purple , or brown when ripe . The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant . Almost all modern edible seedless ( parthenocarp ) bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana . The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata , Musa balbisiana , and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M. balbisiana , depending on their genomic constitution . The old scientific name for this hybrid , Musa sapientum , is no longer used . Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia , and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea . They are grown in 135 countries , primarily for their fruit , and to a lesser extent to make fiber , banana wine , and banana beer and as ornamental plants . The world 's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China , which together accounted for approximately 38 % of total production . Worldwide , there is no sharp distinction between bananas and plantains . Especially in the Americas and Europe , banana usually refers to soft , sweet , dessert bananas , particularly those of the Cavendish group , which are the main exports from banana-growing countries .",
