Set and filmed in New York City and based on Candace Bushnell 's 1997 book of the same name , the show follows the lives of a group of four women - three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties - who , despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) and co-starring Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life - from sex to relationships - through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping to increase HBO 's popularity as a network . The series has won several accolades , including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations .
