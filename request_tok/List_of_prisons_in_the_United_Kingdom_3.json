It did however gain areas from Midlothian .

Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938",

Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig .
