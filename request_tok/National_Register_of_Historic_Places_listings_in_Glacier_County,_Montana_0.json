The party was exploring the Marias River in an attempt to show that the Missouri River watershed extended to the 50th parallel north in order to claim more land for the United States under the Louisiana Purchase . However , they discovered that the watershed does not extend to the 50th parallel and consequently named their campsite Camp Disappointment . Lewis called the site which is shaded by cottonwood trees a beautiful and extensive bottom . Since it was overcast and damp throughout their stay the expedition could not make any astronomical observations . This part of the expedition split off from William Clark 's group at the Great Falls of the Missouri on July 16 .

  "/wiki/Glacier_National_Park_(U.S.)": "Glacier National Park is an American national park located in northwestern Montana , on the Canada-United States border , adjacent to the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia . The park encompasses over 1 million acres ( 4,000 km2 ) and includes parts of two mountain ranges ( sub-ranges of the Rocky Mountains ) , over 130 named lakes , more than 1,000 different species of plants , and hundreds of species of animals . This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem , a region of protected land encompassing 16,000 square miles ( 41,000 km2 ) . The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans . Upon the arrival of European explorers , it was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions . Under pressure , the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government ; it later became part of the park . Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11 , 1910 , a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway . These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places . By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road , later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark , which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park . The mountains of Glacier National Park began forming 170 million years ago when ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata . Known as the Lewis Overthrust , these sedimentary rocks are considered to have some of the finest examples of early life fossils on Earth . The current shapes of the Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show the telltale evidence of massive glacial action , which carved U-shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water , creating lakes",
