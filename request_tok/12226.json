  "/wiki/Home_and_Away": "Home and Away ( often abbreviated as H & A ) is an Australian television soap opera . It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988 . Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to Kangaroo Point , New South Wales , where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area . The soap opera was initially going to be called Refuge , but the name was changed to the friendlier title of Home and Away once production began . The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode ( subsequently in re-runs and on VHS known as Home and Away : The Movie ) . Since then , each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and Home and Away has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television . In Australia , it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm . 'Home and Away ' follows the lives and loves of the residents in Summer Bay , a fictional seaside town of New South Wales . The series initially focused on the Fletcher family - Tom ( Roger Oakley ) and Pippa ( Vanessa Downing ) , and their five foster children , Frank Morgan ( Alex Papps ) , Carly Morris ( Sharyn Hodgson ) , Lynn Davenport ( Helena Bozich ) , Steven Matheson ( Adam Willits ) and Sally Fletcher ( Kate Ritchie ) - who moved from the city into the Summer Bay House , where they assumed the new job of running the caravan park , and eventually took in a sixth foster child , Bobby Simpson ( Nicolle Dickson ) . Home and Away was not without controversy . During the first season alone , it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy , rape , drug and alcohol addiction , drug overdose and attempted suicide .
