  "/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra": "The London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) , founded in 1904 , is a British Orchestra and the oldest of London 's symphony orchestras . It was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood 's Queen 's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services . The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members . From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines , with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season . This practice continued for the orchestra 's first four decades . The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras , to which it lost players and bookings : the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War . The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time . In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts ; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea . By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position , which it has retained subsequently . In 1966 , to perform alongside it in choral works , the orchestra established the LSO Chorus , originally a mix of professional and amateur singers , later a wholly amateur ensemble . As a self-governing body , the orchestra selects the conductors with whom it works . At some stages in its history it has dispensed with a principal conductor and worked only with guests .",

  "/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra": "The London Philharmonic Orchestra ( LPO ) is a British orchestra and one of five permanent symphony orchestras based in London [ clarification needed ] .

The founders ' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival . Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard . After the outbreak of war , the orchestra 's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative . In the post-war years , the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals ; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic , founded respectively in 1946 and 1947 , achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras , including the LPO . By the 1960s the LPO had regained its earlier standards , and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months . In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames , one of London 's major concert venues .
