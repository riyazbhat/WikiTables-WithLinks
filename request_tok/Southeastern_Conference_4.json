  "/wiki/Sugar_Bowl": "The Sugar Bowl is an annual American college football bowl game played in New Orleans , Louisiana . It has been played annually since January 1 , 1935 , and celebrated its 75th anniversary on January 2 , 2009 . The Sugar Bowl , along with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl , are the second-oldest bowl games in the country , behind the Rose Bowl Game . The Sugar Bowl was originally played at Tulane Stadium before moving to the Superdome in 1975 . When the Superdome and the rest of the city suffered damage due to both the winds from and the flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the Sugar Bowl was temporarily moved to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta in 2006 . Since 2007 , the game has been sponsored by Allstate and officially known as the Allstate Sugar Bowl . Previous sponsors include Nokia ( 1996-2006 ) and USF & G Financial Services ( 1988-1995 ) . The Sugar Bowl has had a longstanding - albeit not exclusive - relationship with the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) ( which once had a member institution based in New Orleans , Tulane University ; another Louisiana school , Louisiana State University ( LSU ) in Baton Rouge , is still in the SEC today ) . Indeed , the Sugar Bowl did not feature an SEC team only four times in its first 60 editions , and an SEC team played in the game in every year but one from 1950 to 1995 . The SEC 's opponent varied from year to year , but prior to the advent of the Bowl Championship Series , it was often the runner-up of the Big Eight , SWC , or a major independent . The Sugar Bowl-SEC relationship has been altered over the past twenty years due to conference realignments and the emergence of a series of coalitions and alliances intending to produce an undisputed national champion in college football , but the ties between the Sugar Bowl and the SEC have persisted and have recently been strengthened . Since 2015 , the Sugar Bowl , along with the Rose , Orange , Cotton , Peach , and Fiesta bowls , is one of the New Year 's Six bowls in rotation for the College Football Playoff",

Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80 % of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50 % . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population",
