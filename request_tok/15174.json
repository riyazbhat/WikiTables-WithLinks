The program follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation . Every day , the boys embark on some grand new project ; these are usually unrealistic given the protagonists ' ages ( and are sometimes downright physically impossible ) , which annoys their controlling sister , Candace , who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas ' mother , Linda Flynn-Fletcher , and less frequently to Ferb 's father , Lawrence Fletcher . The series follows a standard plot system : running gags occur every episode , and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb 's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ( named Agent P ) for OWCA ( the Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) , to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz , a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness ( although he is not especially evil and has a good heart in some situations ) . The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys ' project just before Candace can show it to their mother . This usually leaves Candace very frustrated . Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh had previously worked together on Fox 's The Simpsons and Nickelodeon 's Rocko 's Modern Life . The creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters : Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz .
