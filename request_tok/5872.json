  "/wiki/Black_comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance .
