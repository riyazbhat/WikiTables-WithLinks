  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada ( French : Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada ) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada . The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons . However , in the 2019 federal election , they lost their majority , winning 157 seats , but they still remained the largest party in the House .",

The party was founded in 1961 out of the merger of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) with the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) . On the Canadian political spectrum , the party sits to the left of the Liberal Party . Since 2017 , the NDP has been led by Jagmeet Singh , who is the first Indo-Canadian to lead a major federal party in Canada . The federal and provincial ( or territorial ) level NDPs are more integrated than other political parties in Canada , and have shared membership ( except for the New Democratic Party of Quebec ) . Often the third- or fourth-largest party in Canada 's House of Commons , the NDP has never been in power at the federal level , but it has attained second-largest party status once . In the 2011 election under the leadership of Jack Layton , the NDP won the second most seats in the House , gaining the position of Official Opposition for the first time in the party 's history . The NDP subsequently lost 59 seats in the 2015 federal election and fell to third place in Parliament , though it was their second-best seat count to date .

In the 1984 federal election , he ran for Parliament for Saint-L\u00e9onard - Anjou narrowly defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate . It was one of the few ridings that the Liberals retained , as they were swept out of power in a massive Conservative landslide .

From 1996 to 2002 , he served in various cabinet posts including Minister of Labour , Deputy House leader and the Minister responsible for Communications Canada , Canada Post , the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation , the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Lands Company Ltd.

However , he was dismissed from this position on February 10 , 2004 by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson , on the advice of Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham , amidst widespread speculation that during his time as public works minister he was actively involved in the sponsorship scandal . On May 27 , 2004 , Gagliano filed a more than $ 4.5-million lawsuit against Prime Minister Paul Martin and the government . The suit accused the defendants of deliberately attacking Gagliano 's reputation and alleged that he was illegally and unjustly fired .",

  "/wiki/Senate_of_Canada": "The Senate of Canada ( French : S\u00e9nat du Canada ) is the upper house of the Parliament of Canada . The Senate is modelled after the British House of Lords and consists of 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister . Seats are assigned on a regional basis : four regions - defined as Ontario , Quebec , the Maritime provinces , and the Western provinces - each receives 24 seats , with the last nine seats allocated to the remaining portions of the country : six to Newfoundland and Labrador and one each to the three northern territories . Senators serve until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 75 . While the Senate is the upper house of parliament and the House of Commons is the lower house , this does not imply the former is more powerful than the latter . It merely entails that its members and officers outrank the members and officers of the Commons in the order of precedence for the purposes of protocol . As a matter of practice and custom , the Commons is the dominant chamber . The prime minister and Cabinet are responsible solely to the House of Commons and remain in office only so long as they retain the confidence of that chamber . Parliament is composed of the two houses together with the monarch ( represented by the governor general ) . The approval of both houses is necessary for legislation and , thus , the Senate can reject bills passed by the Commons . Between 1867 and 1987 , the Senate rejected fewer than two bills per year , but this has increased in more recent years.
