The Union retained control of the critical border state of Kentucky for the remainder of the war . On October 7 , Buell 's army , in pursuit of Bragg , converged on the small crossroads town of Perryville in three columns . Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general , on Peters Hill , when the Confederate infantry arrived . Both sides were desperate to get access to fresh water . The next day , at dawn , fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike , halting just before the Confederate line . After noon , a Confederate division struck the Union left flank - the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook - and forced it to fall back . When more Confederate divisions joined the fray , the Union line made a stubborn stand , counterattacked , but finally fell back with some units routed . Buell , several miles behind the action , was unaware that a major battle was taking place and did not send any reserves to the front until late in the afternoon .

Of the major battles of the war , Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides . Although the battle itself was inconclusive , the Union Army 's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee . Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Army of the Cumberland marched from Nashville , Tennessee , on December 26 , 1862 , to challenge General Braxton Bragg 's Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro . On December 31 , each army commander planned to attack his opponent 's right flank , but Bragg struck first . A massive assault by the corps of Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee , followed by that of Leonidas Polk , overran the wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook . A stout defense by the division of Brig . Gen. Philip Sheridan in the right center of the line prevented a total collapse , and the Union assumed a tight defensive position backing up to the Nashville Turnpike . Repeated Confederate attacks were repulsed from this concentrated line , most notably in the cedar Round Forest salient against the brigade of Col. William B. Hazen . Bragg attempted to continue the assault with the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge , but the troops were slow in arriving and their multiple piecemeal attacks failed . Fighting resumed on January 2 , 1863 , when Bragg ordered Breckinridge to assault the well-fortified Union position on a hill to the east of the Stones River . Faced with overwhelming artillery , the Confederates were repulsed with heavy losses .",
