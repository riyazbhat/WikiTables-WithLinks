  "/wiki/1963_NHL_Amateur_Draft": "The 1963 NHL Amateur Draft was held on June 5 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , Quebec . It was the first NHL Amateur Draft and consisted of 16-year-old players . The Amateur Draft was instituted by NHL President Clarence Campbell as a means of phasing out the sponsorship of amateur teams by the league 's member clubs . The NHL wanted to create what Campbell called a uniform opportunity for each team to acquire a star player . Prior to the creation of the draft NHL teams would sponsor amateur teams and players , pre-empting other NHL clubs from acquiring new , young talent , and limiting amateur players ' prospects in the NHL to the team which sponsored them . Eligibility in this draft was limited to all amateur players who would reach 17 years of age between August 1 , 1963 , and July 31 , 1964 . Under the league rules , teams were not allowed to talk to the drafted players about turning professional until they turned 18 . At that point , the teams had 72 hours to get the players signed or placed on their negotiation list . Players already on sponsorship lists were ineligible . The draft order was determined by giving the teams choice of their place in the six-team order based on a reverse order of the standings , for example , as the Boston Bruins finished last in the 1962-63 season they were given first choice of pick in the order . The final draft order was chosen to be Montreal Canadiens , Detroit Red Wings , Boston Bruins , New York Rangers , Chicago Black Hawks and Toronto Maple Leafs . The order would rotate in the next draft such that each team moved up one spot in the order , and the first pick Canadiens would move to sixth .",

  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/1964_NHL_Amateur_Draft": "The 1964 NHL Amateur Draft was held at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , Quebec . As was the case in the 1963 Draft , amateur players turning 17 years of age between August 1 , 1964 , and July 31 , 1965 , were eligible , if they were not already sponsored by an NHL club . The order of the draft followed the agreement reached in 1963 , where the order was fixed as Red Wings , Bruins , Rangers , Black Hawks , Maple Leafs and Canadiens . Once again each team received four picks , each team having the right to forfeit their selection and pass it to the next team in the order . All picks were exercised this year . Of the 24 players selected only nine played in the NHL . Syl Apps , Jr. , Jim Dorey , Tim Ecclestone and Mike Pelyk went on to have fruitful NHL careers , each playing well over 200 games a piece . However , the steal of this draft was the Bruins ' third pick , 14th overall : Ken Dryden . Dryden made it known to the Bruins that he would elect to play at Cornell University , earning a Bachelor of Arts degree , instead of turning professional . The Bruins traded his negotiation rights to the Canadiens , where he would play seven full seasons and part of an eighth , earning a Conn Smythe Trophy , Calder Memorial Trophy , five Vezina Trophies , five All-Star Game appearances , five First All-Star awards and six Stanley Cups .",

  "/wiki/1965_NHL_Amateur_Draft": "The 1965 NHL Amateur Draft was held at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , Quebec . For the first time the eligibility rules were changed for the 1965 Draft . The minimum age criterion was increased , to 18 from 16 years . Clubs were not permitted to begin negotiations with the selected players until they reached 19 years of age , and the date from which they were ineligible due to being on club sponsorship lists was pushed back from May 23 to April 1 . The NHL also reached an agreement with the AHL , CHL and WHL , allowing their clubs to participate in the draft . After the NHL clubs made their selections the clubs from the other three leagues were permitted to make their own selections . Each AHL and WHL club was allowed three picks , while each CHL team was allowed two . The general consensus on the part of each participatory club was that the talent pool from which to draft was exceptionally poor . The majority of amateur players falling within the new age rules had already been sponsored , if not turned professional . A paltry 11 picks were made , which to this date remains the lowest ever in an NHL Draft . Only two players played in the NHL : Pierre Bouchard and Michel Parizeau . The pool of available player talent was considered so poor that the Toronto Maple Leafs elected not to participate whatsoever .",
