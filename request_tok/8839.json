  "/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)": "Tackle is a playing position in gridiron football . Historically , in the one-platoon system prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , a tackle played on both offense and defense . In the modern system of specialized units , offensive tackle and defensive tackle are separate positions , and the stand-alone term tackle refers to the offensive tackle position only . The offensive tackle ( OT , T ) is a position on the offensive line , left and right . Like other offensive linemen , their job is to block : to physically keep defenders away from the offensive player who has the football and enable him to advance the football and eventually score a touchdown . The term tackle is a vestige of an earlier era of football in which the same players played both offense and defense .",

  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
