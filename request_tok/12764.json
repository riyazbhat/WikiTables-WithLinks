Caetani was of baronial origin with family connections to the papacy . He succeeded Pope Celestine V , a Benedictine , who had resigned from the papal throne . Boniface spent his early career abroad in diplomatic roles . In the College of Cardinals , he discriminated not only against the Benedictines but also members of the Colonna family , some of whom had contested the validity of the 1294 papal conclave that elected him following the unusual resignation of Pope Celestine V. The dispute resulted in battles between troops of Boniface and his adversaries and the deliberate destruction and salting of the town of Palestrina , despite the pope 's assurances that the surrendering city would be spared . Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims of any pope to temporal as well as spiritual power . He involved himself often with foreign affairs , including in France , Sicily , Italy and the First War of Scottish Independence . These views , and his chronic intervention in temporal affairs , led to many bitter quarrels with Albert I of Germany , Philip IV of France , and Dante Alighieri , who wrote his treatise De Monarchia to dispute Boniface 's claims of papal supremacy and placed the pope in the Eighth Circle of Hell in his Divine Comedy , among the simoniacs . Boniface systematized canon law by collecting it in a new volume , Liber Sextus ( 1298 ) , which continues to be important source material for canon lawyers . He organized the first Catholic jubilee year to take place in Rome in order to gain political clout over Philip IV of France or make up for loss of funds from him . Boniface had first entered into conflict with Philip IV of France in 1296 when the latter sought to reinforce the nascent nation state by imposing taxes on the clergy and barring them from administration of the law . The conflict escalated when the French arrested and convicted papal legate Bernard Saisset for insurrection ."
