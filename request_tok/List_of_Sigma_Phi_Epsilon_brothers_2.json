  "/wiki/Leveraged_buyout": "A leveraged buyout ( LBO ) is a financial transaction in which a company is purchased with a combination of equity and debt , such that the company 's cash flow is the collateral used to secure and repay the borrowed money . The use of debt , which normally has a lower cost of capital than equity , serves to reduce the overall cost of financing the acquisition . The cost of debt is lower because interest payments often reduce corporate income tax liability , whereas dividend payments normally do not . This reduced cost of financing allows greater gains to accrue to the equity , and , as a result , the debt serves as a lever to increase the returns to the equity . The term LBO is usually employed when a financial sponsor acquires a company . However , many corporate transactions are partially funded by bank debt , thus effectively also representing an LBO . LBOs can have many different forms such as management buyout ( MBO ) , management buy-in ( MBI ) , secondary buyout and tertiary buyout , among others , and can occur in growth situations , restructuring situations , and insolvencies . LBOs mostly occur in private companies , but can also be employed with public companies ( in a so-called PtP transaction - Public to Private ) . As financial sponsors increase their returns by employing a very high leverage ( i.e. , a high ratio of debt to equity ) , they have an incentive to employ as much debt as possible to finance an acquisition . This has , in many cases , led to situations in which companies were over-leveraged , meaning that they did not generate sufficient cash flows to service their debt , which in turn led to insolvency or to debt-to-equity swaps in which the equity owners lose control over the business to the lenders .",

  "/wiki/Financial_thriller": "Financial thriller is a subgenre of thriller fiction in which the financial system and economy play a major role . The novel The Financier ( 1912 ) by Theodore Dreiser displays elements of a financial thriller . Paul Erdman helped popularize the modern financial thriller , with The Billion Dollar Sure Thing ( 1973 ) . The former president of a Swiss bank , he penned the novel while in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges related to speculating in the cocoa market . In many cases the protagonist of a financial thriller is a financial professional such as Christian Slaters character in the 2005 film The Deal , or John Kent in Martin Bodenham 's 2011 novel , The Geneva Connection . Often , the plot centers on a financial crime . It may be a crime that merely enriches a small number of individuals as with The Millionaires by Brad Meltzer , or one that threatens the entire financial system , as in Tom Clancys Debt of Honor . In Flash Crash , by Denison Hatch the financial crime involves an algorithmic programmer ( quant ) who is blackmailed into writing a program that will crash the international gold markets . Financial thrillers are often used as morality plays to illustrate the evils of greed , as in Black Money ( 1995 ) , by Michael M. Thomas . In the wake of the late-2000s financial crisis , some financial thrillers took on educational roles . The 2011 HBO TV-movie Too Big to Fail is , in the words of Jesse Eisinger , extraordinarily revealing about the financial crisis but not always in a helpful way . For example , Eisinger says , The government gave the banks money but did n't get voting rights and did n't prevent the banks from using the money to pay dividends or bonuses .",
