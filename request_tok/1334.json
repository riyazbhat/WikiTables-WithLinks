In a few years , Intocable fused the genres Tejano and Norte\u00f1o with a musical signature that fused Tejano 's robust conjunto and Norte\u00f1o folk rhythms with a pop balladry . Intocable is perhaps the most influential group in Tejano and their tough Tejano/Norte\u00f1o fusion has become the blueprint for dozens of Tex-Mex groups . The group 's style , which combines romantic , hooky melodies , tight instrumentation and vocal harmony , is consistently imitated by other Tejano and Norte\u00f1o groups , including Im\u00e1n , Costumbre , Solido , Estruendo , Intenso , Duelo and Zinzero . Career accomplishments include four consecutive sold-out nights at Mexico City 's prestigious Auditorio Nacional and the group 's 2003 headlining appearance at Reliant Stadium in Houston , which drew a record 70,104 fans . They also play every year as tradition with two sold-out dates ( lately three ) at the 10,000-capacity Monterrey Arena in Monterrey , Mexico - an unusual accomplishment given that Norte\u00f1o groups typically play large dance halls and rarely arenas unless it 's an all day festival event . Intocable has also won at least eight of Univision 's Premio Lo Nuestro awards . They received their first Grammy win in February 2005 at the 47th Annual Grammys ( Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album ; Intimamente ) and second at the 53rd annual Grammys for their album Classic . They were the first of their genre to play at Dallas Cowboys Stadium , at the halftime show of the 2011 Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Redskins game , also at The Greek Theatre , Los Angeles . They garnered two of the 5 nominations to the Billboard Regional Mexican Awards and got a nod for Best Norte\u00f1o Album to the 2011 Latin Grammy for their album INTOCABLE 2011 . They were also nominated for a Grammy for the album . INTOCABLE 2011 was released under the group 's own music label Good-i Music and the first two singles , Robarte Un Beso and Promet\u00ed , went to Number 1 on US regional radio charts .",

Viloria , the main founder , retired to focus on his college studies ; he was the group 's main composer for several years . His home was also the main place where practices were held in the group 's early years . The name Guaco is attributed a bird named Guaco that would fly over Viloria 's house every morning . The band began as a gaita zuliana group , and during the 70s diverged from the traditional way of playing the genre by integrating it with elements of salsa music ( such as complex horn arrangements ) , and adding in violins and electric guitars which were very unusual instruments to be included in a gaita band . Today , the Guaco rhythm continues to evolve through a complex mixture of gaita , salsa , pop music , jazz , funk and even rock and roll and vallenato rhythms , concocting a recognizable and unique style that is considered to be a hallmark of the tropical music genre . Guaco won Pepsi Venezuela Music Awards for Tropical Video of the Year in 2012 , for Artist of the Year , Album of the Year , Song of the Year , Tropical Video of the Year , and Tropical Artist of the Year in 2013 , for Best Tropical Artist in 2014 , and for Salsa Song of the Year , Salsa Video of the Year , Tropical Fusion Album of the Year , and Album of the Year in 2015 .",
