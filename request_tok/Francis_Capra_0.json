Set in the fictional town of Neptune , the series starred Kristen Bell as the title character , a student who progressed from high school to college during the series while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father . The first season had seven regular characters . As Thomas had conceived the show as a one-year mystery , he decided to introduce and eliminate several characters in order to create an equally fascinating mystery for the series ' second season .

The third season features a cast of ten actors who receive billing , an increase from the nine actors in the second . Three of the regulars in the second season are written out of the series , two new characters are introduced and two others are upgraded from recurring roles ."
