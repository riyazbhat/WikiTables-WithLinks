Until March 2007 , Sony Music Japan also had its own North American sublabel , Tofu Records . Releases of Sony Music Japan now appear on Columbia Records and/or Epic Records in North America . Sony does not have the trademark rights to the Columbia name in Japan , so releases under Columbia Records from another country appears on Sony Records in Japan , but retains the usage of the walking eye logo .

Nippon Columbia also does not have direct relations with the British Columbia Graphophone Company ( an EMI subsidiary ) , so the licensee for the British Columbia Graphophone Company was actually Toshiba Musical Industries .
