  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Single_transferable_vote": "The single transferable vote ( STV ) is a proportional voting system designed to achieve or closely approach proportional representation through voters ranking candidates in multi-seat organizations or constituencies ( voting districts ) . There are various ways of counting votes under STV , as described below . Under STV , each elector ( voter ) gets a single vote in an election electing multiple winners . Each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and also marks back-up preferences . The vote goes to the voter 's first preference if possible , but if their first preference is eliminated , instead of being thrown away , the vote is transferred to a back-up preference , with the vote being assigned to the voter 's second , third , or lower choice or being apportioned fractionally to different candidates . The counting process works thus : votes are totalled , and a quota ( the minimum number of votes required to win a seat ) is derived . [ note 1 ] If the elector 's first-ranked candidate achieves the quota , the candidate is declared elected ; and , in some STV systems , any surplus vote is transferred to other candidates in proportion to the next back-up preference marked on the ballots . If more candidates than seats remain , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated , with the votes in their favour being transferred to other candidates as determined by the voters ' next back-up preference . These elections and eliminations , and vote transfers if applicable , continue until enough candidates exceed quota to fill all the seats or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats , at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected . The specific method of transferring votes varies in different systems ( see \u00a7 Counting methods ) . Advocates for STV say that it enables votes to be cast for individual candidates rather than for parties and party machine-controlled party lists , and - compared to first-past-the-post ( FPTP ) voting - reduces wasted votes ( votes being wasted on losers and surplus votes being wasted on sure winners ) by transferring them to other preferred candidates . STV also provides approximately proportional representation , even in non-partisan elections , ensuring that minority factions have some representation .",
  "/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting": "Instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) is a type of ranked preferential voting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates . Instead of indicating support for only one candidate , voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference . Ballots are initially counted for each voter 's top choice . If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices , that candidate wins . If not , then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated . The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice . This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes . When the field is reduced to two , it has become an instant runoff that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head . Compared to plurality voting , IRV can reduce the effect of vote-splitting when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters . Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries . For example , it is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and at least one house of all Australian state parliaments ; the President of India and members of legislative councils in India ; the President of Ireland ; members of Congress in Maine in the United States ; and the Parliament in Papua New Guinea . The method is also used in local elections around the world , including New York City offices starting in 2021 .",

The Czech Republic is a landlocked country with a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,866 square kilometers ( 30,450 sq mi ) with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , with 10.7 million inhabitants . Its capital and largest city is Prague , with 1.3 million residents ; other major cities are Brno , Ostrava , Olomouc and Pilsen . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia . The Czech state was formed in the late ninth century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire along with the Kingdom of Germany , the Kingdom of Burgundy , the Kingdom of Italy ; and became the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 , reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars , the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618-20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism , reimposed Catholicism , and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization .",
  "/wiki/Contingent_vote": "The contingent vote , also known as top-two IRV is an electoral system used to elect a single winner . It is a variation of instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) , in which the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference . Under the contingent vote , there is a first round in which a candidate requires a majority of first preference votes to win . If no candidate has a majority , then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and there is a second count , where the votes of those who supported eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates . This ensures that one candidate achieves a majority . The contingent vote differs from IRV which allows for many rounds of counting , eliminating only one weakest candidate each round . The contingent vote can also be considered a compressed form of the two-round system ( runoff system ) , in which both 'rounds ' occur without the need for voters to go to the polls twice . Today , a special variant of the contingent vote is used to elect the President of Sri Lanka . Another variant , called the supplementary vote , is used to pick directly elected mayors and police and crime commissioners in England . In the past the ordinary form of the contingent vote was used to elect the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1892 to 1942 . To date , this has been the longest continuous use of the system anywhere in the world . It was also used in the US state of Alabama in the 1920s .",

The official language of the country , Estonian , is the second-most-spoken Finnic language . The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 BC . Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile . In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule , resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991 .",

[ failed verification ] About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu 's coasts , either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi - where tourism is the major local industry - or Lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount . Due to its terrain , the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited . The majority of Fiji 's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago . Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves .

  "/wiki/Borda_count": "The Borda count is a family of single-winner election methods in which voters rank options or candidates in order of preference . The Borda count determines the outcome of a debate or the winner of an election by giving each candidate , for each ballot , a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates ranked lower . Once all votes have been counted the option or candidate with the most points is the winner . The Borda count is intended to elect broadly acceptable options or candidates , rather than those preferred by a majority , and so is often described as a consensus-based voting system rather than a majoritarian one . The modified Borda count is a variant used for decision-making . For multi-winner elections , especially when proportional representation is important , the quota Borda system may be used . The Borda count was developed independently several times , as early as 1435 by Nicholas of Cusa , but is named for the 18th-century French mathematician and naval engineer Jean-Charles de Borda , who devised the system in 1770 . It is currently used to elect members of the Parliament of Nauru and two ethnic minority members of the National Assembly of Slovenia , in modified forms to determine which candidates are elected to the party list seats in Icelandic parliamentary elections , and for selecting presidential election candidates in Kiribati .

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland .

Together with the Council of the European Union , it adopts European legislation , normally on a proposal from the European Commission . The Parliament is composed of 705 members ( MEPs ) . The Parliament represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world ( after the Parliament of India ) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world ( 375 million eligible voters in 2009 ) . Since 1979 , it has been directly elected every five years by European Union citizens , using universal suffrage . Voter turnout for parliamentary elections has decreased at each election after 1979 until 2019 , when the voter turnout increased by 8 percentage points and went above 50 % for the first time since 1994 . Voting age is 18 in all member states except Malta and Austria , where it is 16 , and Greece , where it is 17 .

The United Kingdom referred to was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1800 , and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland after the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 . Accordingly , the House of Commons assumed its current title . Under the Parliament Act 1911 , the Lords ' power to reject legislation was reduced to a delaying power . The government is solely responsible to the House of Commons and the prime minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the confidence of a majority of the Commons .",

The island is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait . The legislative capital , Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , is a suburb of the commercial capital and largest city , Colombo . Sri Lanka 's documented history spans 3,000 years , with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years . It has a rich cultural heritage , and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka , the P\u0101li Canon , date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC . Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road . Sri Lanka was known in the west and from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon ( /s\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ , US also /se\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ ) . A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence , which was granted in 1948 ; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972 . Sri Lanka 's recent history has been marred by a 26-year civil war , which ended decisively when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in 2009 . The current constitution stipulates the political system as a republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system . It has had a long history of international engagement , as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , and a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the G77 , and the Non-Aligned Movement .

  "/wiki/Open_list": "Open list describes any variant of party-list proportional representation where voters have at least some influence on the order in which a party 's candidates are elected . This is as opposed to closed list , which allows only active members , party officials , or consultants to determine the order of its candidates and gives the general voter no influence at all on the position of the candidates placed on the party list . Additionally , an open list system allows voters to select individuals rather than parties . Different systems give voter different amounts of influence . Voter 's choice is usually called preference vote .",
  "/wiki/Zimbabwe": "Zimbabwe ( /z\u026am\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0bwe\u026a , -wi/ ) , officially the Republic of Zimbabwe , formerly Rhodesia , is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa , between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers , bordered by South Africa , Botswana , Zambia and Mozambique . The capital and largest city is Harare . The second largest is Bulawayo . A country of roughly 14 million people , Zimbabwe has 16 official languages , with English , Shona , and Ndebele the most common . Since the 11th century , present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade . The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s ; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 . In 1965 , the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia . The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces ; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980 . Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations , from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government , and from which it withdrew in December 2003 . The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union ( AU ) , and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) . It was once known as the Jewel of Africa for its great prosperity . Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 , when his ZANU-PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule ; he was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his resignation in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Caucasian_race": "The Caucasian race ( also Caucasoid or Europid ) is a grouping of human beings historically regarded as a biological taxon , which , depending on which of the historical race classifications is used , has usually included ancient and modern populations from Europe , Western Asia , Central Asia , South Asia , North Africa , and the Horn of Africa . First introduced in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen School of History , the term denoted one of three purported major races of humankind ( Caucasoid , Mongoloid , Negroid ) . In biological anthropology , Caucasoid has been used as an umbrella term for phenotypically similar groups from these different regions , with a focus on skeletal anatomy , and especially cranial morphology , without regard to skin tone . Ancient and modern Caucasoid populations were thus not exclusively white , but ranged in complexion from white-skinned to dark brown . Since the second half of the 20th century , physical anthropologists have moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective , and have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors , as the concept is also understood in the social sciences . Although Caucasian / Caucasoid and their counterparts Negroid and Mongoloid have been used less frequently as a biological classification in forensic anthropology ( where it is sometimes used as a way to identify the ancestry of human remains based on interpretations of osteological measurements ) , the terms remain in use by some anthropologists . In the United States , the root term Caucasian is often used , both colloquially and by the US Census Bureau , as a synonym for white . This usage is considered erroneous by anthropologists and other scientists , who note that it conflates an anthropologically valid category ( Caucasoid ) with the social construct of the white race . The conflation of Caucasian with white is also demographically misleading since the category Caucasoid has sometimes been considered to include various populations , such as South Asians and North Africans , that are not considered white in a social sense ."
