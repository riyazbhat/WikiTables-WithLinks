  "/wiki/New_Brunswick": "New Brunswick is one of four Atlantic provinces on the east coast of Canada . According to the Constitution of Canada , New Brunswick is the only bilingual province . About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones , and one third francophones . One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual . Atypically for Canada , only about half of the population lives in urban areas , mostly in Greater Moncton , Greater Saint John and the capital Fredericton . Unlike the other Maritime provinces , New Brunswick 's terrain is mostly forested uplands , with much of the land further from the coast , giving it a harsher climate . New Brunswick is 83 % forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city . The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly , reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century",

  "/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland": "Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907 to 1934 when it surrendered dominion status by ending self-government in exchange for British Royal Commission rule as a crown colony . Newfoundland remained a crown colony until Newfoundland joined Canada as a province . The dominion , situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast , comprised the island of Newfoundland as well as Labrador on the continental mainland . Before attaining dominion status , Newfoundland was a British colony , self-governing from 1855 . Newfoundland was one of the original dominions within the meaning of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster of 1931 , accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions at the time . In 1934 , Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status , ending 79 years of self-government . This episode came about due to a crisis in Newfoundland 's public finances in 1932 . Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island ( completed in the 1890s ) and by raising its own regiment for the First World War . In November 1932 the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt . The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position . The Commission 's report , published in October 1933 , recommended that Newfoundland give up its system of self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer the dominion through an appointed commission . The Newfoundland parliament accepted this recommendation and presented a petition to the King asking for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again",

  "/wiki/United_Province_of_Canada": "The Province of Canada ( or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas ) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867 . Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton , 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837-1838 . The Act of Union 1840 , passed on 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841 , merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses , a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber . In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837-1838 , unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors . Firstly , Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues , and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements . Secondly , unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats , despite the larger population of Lower Canada . Although Durham 's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for responsible government ( a government accountable to an independent local legislature ) , only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841 . For the first seven years , the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the Queen 's Ministers . Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine-Baldwin ministry in 1849 , when Governor General James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party , effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role . The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867 , when it was divided into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada , while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada ( which had included Labrador until 1809 , when Labrador was transferred to the British colony of Newfoundland ) . Upper Canada was primarily English-speaking , whereas Lower Canada was primarily French-speaking",

The Saint John area was an important area for trade and defence for Acadia during the French colonial era and Fort La Tour , in the city 's harbour , was a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War . After over a century of ownership disputes over the land surrounding Saint John between the French and English , the English deported the French colonists in 1755 and constructed Fort Howe above the harbour in 1779 . In 1785 , the City of Saint John was established by uniting the two towns of Parrtown and Carleton on each side of the harbour after the arrival of thousands of refugees from the American Revolution who wished to remain British and were forced to leave their U.S. homes .

Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries .

  "/wiki/Great_Fire_of_1922": "The Great Fire of 1922 was a wildfire burning through the Lesser Clay Belt in the Timiskaming District , Ontario , Canada , from October 4 to 5 , 1922 . It has been called one of the ten worst natural disasters in Canadian history . The preceding summer had been unusually hot and dry . Fire rangers , anticipating the upcoming burn season , had requested to stay in the area but were not granted permission . They left at the end of the fire season in mid September , leaving the area without fire protection services . In the fall when burning permits were no longer required , farmers and settlers started to set small bush fires to clear the land . Dry conditions had persisted past the usual burn season and on October 4 , the wind turned into hurricane-force gales , fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno . Over two days , the fire consumed an area of 1,680 square kilometres ( 650 sq mi ) , affecting 18 townships in Ontario . It completely destroyed the communities of North Cobalt , Charlton , Thornloe , Heaslip , and numerous smaller settlements . Englehart and New Liskeard were partly burnt . In all 43 people died .

The fire was allowed to burn freely , a result of local forest management policy and the lack of settlements in the region . The Chinchaga fire produced large amounts of smoke , creating the 1950 Great Smoke Pall , observed across eastern North America and Europe . As the existence of the massive fire was not well-publicized , and the smoke was mostly in the upper atmosphere and could not be smelled , there was much speculation about the atmospheric haze and its provenance .
