  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
  "/wiki/Emmanuel's_Gift": "Filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern capture Emmanuel Yeboahs heart , spirit , and determination through the 2005 documentary Emmanuels Gift , based on the true story of Emmanuels life solely dedicated to making change . Narrated by Oprah Winfrey , the documentary follows Emmanuel on his journey to change the political and societal norms wrapped around disabled people in his home country of Ghana . Being that he was born with a deformed right leg , Emmanuel witnessed firsthand his whole life how disabled people were treated and viewed in the eyes of society . Children born with disabilities in Ghana are often abandoned or , in more extreme cases , killed . If they do survive , they often become poor beggars on the street . He , on the other hand , grew up in a small home with his mother and family . His father abandoned his mother when he found out that his son had a deformed leg . Emmanuel shined shoes every day for $ 2 , refusing to let the prejudices against disabled people get to his head . One day he put in a grant request to the Challenged Athletes Foundation based in California all the way over in the United States . His request was not one for money , but rather for a bike that he would later receive to travel nearly 380 miles across the entire country of Ghana on to show those that did not support equal rights that disabled people can accomplish above and beyond what society tells them they can . Word spread fast about Emmanuels long journey on the bike given to him by the foundation . The Challenged Athletes Foundation , who gave Emmanuel the bicycle , reached out and asked him to come to America to do their triathlon .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

Typically , the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater . Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater ; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching .

Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come . Another belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens , the terrestrial world , and the underworld .

This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves Moksha or Nirvana . Any place of existence , either of humans , souls or deities , outside the tangible world ( Heaven , Hell , or other ) is referred to as otherworld ."
