Depending on how heavy a caseload they carry , senior judges remain entitled to maintain a staffed office , including a secretary and one or more law clerks . States having a similar system include Iowa ( for judges on the Iowa Court of Appeals ) , Pennsylvania , and Virginia ( for Justices of the Virginia Supreme Court ) .

  "/wiki/Recess_appointment": "In the United States , a recess appointment is an appointment by the President of a federal official when the U.S. Senate is in recess . Under the U.S. Constitution 's Appointments Clause , the president is empowered to nominate , and with the advice and consent ( confirmation ) of the United States Senate , make appointments to high-level policy-making positions in federal departments , agencies , boards , and commissions . A recess appointment under Article II , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution is an alternative method of appointing officials that allows the filling of vacancies to maintain the continuity of administrative government through the temporary filling of offices during periods when the Senate is not in session . On occasion , and controversially , this power has also been used by presidents to temporarily install an unpopular nominee by sidestepping the Senate 's role in the confirmation process , and the Senate has taken measures from time to time to prevent a President making recess appointments . A recess appointment must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the next session of Congress , or the appointment expires . In current practice this means that a recess appointment must be approved by roughly the end of the next calendar year , and thus could last for almost two years",

Before the Court of Claims was established , monetary claims against the federal government were normally submitted through petitions to Congress . By the time of the Court 's creation , the workload had become unwieldy so Congress gave the Court jurisdiction to hear all monetary claims based upon a law , a regulation , or a federal government contract . The Court was required to report its findings to Congress and to prepare bills for payments to claimants whose petitions were approved by the Court . Since only Congress was constitutionally empowered to make appropriations , Congress still had to approve the bills and reports , but it usually did so pro forma . The Court originally had three judges , who were given lifetime appointments . The judges were authorized to appoint commissioners to take depositions and issue subpoenas .

The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed . He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics , while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably , although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality",
