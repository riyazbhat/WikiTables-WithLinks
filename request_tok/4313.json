  "/wiki/Ruby_laser": "A ruby laser is a solid-state laser that uses a synthetic ruby crystal as its gain medium . The first working laser was a ruby laser made by Theodore H. Ted Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories on May 16 , 1960 . Ruby lasers produce pulses of coherent visible light at a wavelength of 694.3 nm , which is a deep red color . Typical ruby laser pulse lengths are on the order of a millisecond .",
  "/wiki/Holography": "A hologram is a physical recording of an interference pattern which uses diffraction to reproduce a three-dimensional light field , resulting in an image which retains the depth , parallax , and other properties of the original scene . Holography is the science and practice of making holograms . A hologram is a photographic recording of a light field , rather than an image formed by a lens . The holographic medium , i.e. , the object produced by a holographic process ( which itself may be referred to as a hologram ) is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light . It is an encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of variations in the opacity , density , or surface profile of the photographic medium . When suitably lit , the interference pattern diffracts the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field , and the objects that were in it exhibit visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with the relative position of the observer . That is , the view of the image from different angles represents the subject viewed from similar angles.In this sense , holograms do not simply produce the illusion of depth but are truly three-dimensional images . In its pure form , holography requires the use of laser light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram . A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded scene can be reproduced . In common practice , however , major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination to view the hologram , and in some cases , to make it . Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure , to avoid the hazardous high-powered pulsed lasers otherwise needed to optically freeze moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires . Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed .",
  "/wiki/Tattoo_removal": "Tattoo removal has been performed with various tools since the start of tattooing . While tattoos were once considered permanent [ citation needed ] , it is now possible to remove them with treatments , fully or partially . The standard modality for tattoo removal is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using Q-switched lasers . Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments . Typically , black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are still very difficult to remove . Success can depend on a wide variety of factors including skin color , ink color , and the depth at which the ink was applied . Q-switched lasers first became commercially available in the early 1990s . For a couple of decades before that , continuous-wave lasers were used as medical lasers for tattoo removal . Continuous-wave lasers used a high energy beam that ablated the target area and destroyed surrounding tissue structures as well as tattoo ink . Treatment tended to be painful and cause scarring . Before the development of laser tattoo removal methods , common techniques included dermabrasion , TCA ( Trichloroacetic acid , an acid that removes the top layers of skin , reaching as deep as the layer in which the tattoo ink resides ) , salabrasion ( scrubbing the skin with salt ) , cryosurgery and excision which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos . Many other methods for removing tattoos have been suggested historically including the injection or application of tannic acid , lemon juice , garlic and pigeon dung .",

  "/wiki/Laser_diode": "A laser diode , ( LD ) , injection laser diode ( ILD ) , or diode laser is a semiconductor device similar to a light-emitting diode in which a diode pumped directly with electrical current can create lasing conditions at the diode 's junction . :3 Laser diodes can directly convert electrical energy into light . Driven by voltage , the doped p-n-transition allows for recombination of an electron with a hole . Due to the drop of the electron from a higher energy level to a lower one , radiation , in the form of an emitted photon is generated . This is spontaneous emission . Stimulated emission can be produced when the process is continued and further generate light with the same phase , coherence and wavelength . The choice of the semiconductor material determines the wavelength of the emitted beam , which in today 's laser diodes range from infra-red to the UV spectrum . Laser diodes are the most common type of lasers produced , with a wide range of uses that include fiber optic communications , barcode readers , laser pointers , CD/DVD/Blu-ray disc reading/recording , laser printing , laser scanning and light beam illumination .

  "/wiki/Laser_rangefinder": "A laser rangefinder is a rangefinder that uses a laser beam to determine the distance to an object . The most common form of laser rangefinder operates on the time of flight principle by sending a laser pulse in a narrow beam towards the object and measuring the time taken by the pulse to be reflected off the target and returned to the sender . Due to the high speed of light , this technique is not appropriate for high precision sub-millimeter measurements , where triangulation and other techniques are often used .",
  "/wiki/Nonlinear_optics": "Nonlinear optics ( NLO ) is the branch of optics that describes the behaviour of light in nonlinear media , that is , media in which the polarization density P responds non-linearly to the electric field E of the light . The non-linearity is typically observed only at very high light intensities ( values of atomic electric fields , typically 108 V/m ) such as those provided by lasers . Above the Schwinger limit , the vacuum itself is expected to become nonlinear . In nonlinear optics , the superposition principle no longer holds . The first nonlinear optical effect to be predicted was two-photon absorption , by Maria Goeppert Mayer for her PhD in 1931 , but it remained an unexplored theoretical curiosity until 1961 and the almost simultaneous observation of two-photon absorption at Bell Labs and the discovery of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken et al . at University of Michigan , both shortly after the construction of the first laser by Theodore Maiman . However , some nonlinear effects were discovered before the development of the laser . The theoretical basis for many nonlinear processes were first described in Bloembergen 's monograph Nonlinear Optics .",

  "/wiki/Solar_radiation": "Solar irradiance is the power per unit area ( watt per square metre , W/m2 ) , received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation as reported in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument . Solar irradiance is often integrated over a given time period in order to report the radiant energy emitted into the surrounding environment ( joule per square metre , J/m2 ) , during that time period . This integrated solar irradiance is called solar irradiation , solar exposure , solar insolation , or insolation . Irradiance may be measured in space or at the Earth 's surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering . Irradiance in space is a function of distance from the Sun , the solar cycle , and cross-cycle changes . Irradiance on the Earth 's surface additionally depends on the tilt of the measuring surface , the height of the sun above the horizon , and atmospheric conditions . Solar irradiance affects plant metabolism and animal behavior .

  "/wiki/Neodymium": "Neodymium is a chemical element with the symbol Nd and atomic number 60 . Neodymium belongs to the lanthanide series and is a rare-earth element . It is a hard , slightly malleable silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture . When oxidized , neodymium reacts quickly to produce pink , purple/blue and yellow compounds in the +2 , +3 and +4 oxidation states . Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach . It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastn\u00e4site . Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides , and it is usually refined for general use . Although neodymium is classed as a rare-earth element , it is fairly common , no rarer than cobalt , nickel , or copper , and is widely distributed in the Earth 's crust . Most of the world 's commercial neodymium is mined in China . Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927 , and they remain a popular additive in glasses . The color of neodymium compounds is due to the Nd3+ ion and is often a reddish-purple , but it changes with the type of lighting , because of the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury , trivalent europium or terbium .

A laser operated in this way is sometimes referred to as a femtosecond laser , for example in modern refractive surgery . The basis of the technique is to induce a fixed-phase relationship between the longitudinal modes of the laser 's resonant cavity .

  "/wiki/Laser_pointer": "A laser pointer or laser pen is a small handheld device with a power source ( usually a battery ) and a laser diode emitting a very narrow coherent low-powered laser beam of visible light , intended to be used to highlight something of interest by illuminating it with a small bright spot of colored light . Power is restricted in most jurisdictions not to exceed 5 mW . The small width of the beam and low power of typical laser pointers make the beam itself invisible in a reasonably clean atmosphere , only showing a point of light when striking an opaque surface . Some higher-powered laser pointers project a visible beam via scattering from dust particles or water droplets along the beam path . Higher-power and higher-frequency green or blue lasers may produce a beam visible even in clean air because of Rayleigh scattering from air molecules , especially when viewed in moderately-to-dimly lit conditions . The intensity of such scattering increases when these beams are viewed from angles near the beam axis . Such pointers , particularly in the green-light output range , are used as astronomical-object pointers for teaching purposes . The low-cost availability of infrared ( IR ) diode laser modules of up to 1000 mW ( 1 watt ) output has created a generation of IR-pumped , frequency doubled , green , blue , and violet diode-pumped solid-state laser pointers with visible power up to 300 mW . Because the invisible IR component in the beams of these visible lasers is difficult to filter out , and also because filtering it contributes extra heat which is difficult to dissipate in a small pocket laser pointer package , it is often left as a beam component in cheaper high-power pointers . This invisible IR component causes a degree of extra potential hazard in these devices when pointed at nearby objects and people . Laser pointers make a potent signaling tool , even in daylight , and are able to produce a bright signal for potential search and rescue vehicles using an inexpensive , small and lightweight device of the type that could be routinely carried in an emergency kit .

The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate , found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life ; gypsum , anhydrite , fluorite , and apatite are also sources of calcium . The name derives from Latin calx lime , which was obtained from heating limestone . Some calcium compounds were known to the ancients , though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century . Pure calcium was isolated in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide by Humphry Davy , who named the element . Calcium compounds are widely used in many industries : in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation , in the paper industry as bleaches , as components in cement and electrical insulators , and in the manufacture of soaps . On the other hand , the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity ; still , in small quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking , and sometimes , as a calcium-lead alloy , in making automotive batteries .

  "/wiki/Second_harmonic_generation": "Second-harmonic generation ( SHG , also called frequency doubling ) is a nonlinear optical process in which two photons with the same frequency interact with a nonlinear material , are combined , and generate a new photon with twice the energy of the initial photons ( equivalently , twice the frequency and half the wavelength ) , that conserves the coherence of the excitation . It is a special case of sum-frequency generation ( 2 photons ) , and more generally of harmonic generation . The second-order nonlinear susceptibility of a medium characterizes its tendency to cause SHG . Second-harmonic generation , like other even-order nonlinear optical phenomena , is not allowed in media with inversion symmetry . However , effects such as the Bloch-Siegert shift ( oscillation ) , found when two-level systems are driven at Rabi frequencies comparable to their transition frequencies , will give rise to second harmonic generation in centro-symmetric systems . In some cases , almost 100 % of the light energy can be converted to the second harmonic frequency . These cases typically involve intense pulsed laser beams passing through large crystals , and careful alignment to obtain phase matching . In other cases , like second-harmonic imaging microscopy , only a tiny fraction of the light energy is converted to the second harmonic - but this light can nevertheless be detected with the help of optical filters . Generating the second harmonic , often called frequency doubling , is also a process in radio communication ; it was developed early in the 20th century , and has been used with frequencies in the megahertz range .

  "/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion": "Inertial confinement fusion ( ICF ) is a type of fusion energy research that attempts to initiate nuclear fusion reactions by heating and compressing a fuel target , typically in the form of a pellet that most often contains a mixture of deuterium and tritium . Typical fuel pellets are about the size of a pinhead and contain around 10 milligrams of fuel . To compress and heat the fuel , energy is delivered to the outer layer of the target using high-energy beams of laser light , electrons or ions , although for a variety of reasons , almost all ICF devices as of 2015 [ update ] have used lasers . The heated outer layer explodes outward , producing a reaction force against the remainder of the target , accelerating it inwards , compressing the target . This process is designed to create shock waves that travel inward through the target . A sufficiently powerful set of shock waves can compress and heat the fuel at the center so much that fusion reactions occur . ICF is one of two major branches of fusion energy research , the other being magnetic confinement fusion . When it was first proposed in the early 1970s , ICF appeared to be a practical approach to power production and the field flourished . Experiments during the 1970s and '80s demonstrated that the efficiency of these devices was much lower than expected , and reaching ignition would not be easy . Throughout the 1980s and '90s , many experiments were conducted in order to understand the complex interaction of high-intensity laser light and plasma .

Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital 3-D representations of the target . The name lidar , now used as an acronym of light detection and ranging ( sometimes , light imaging , detection , and ranging ) , was originally a portmanteau of light and radar . Lidar sometimes is called 3D laser scanning , a special combination of a 3D scanning and laser scanning . It has terrestrial , airborne , and mobile applications . Lidar is commonly used to make high-resolution maps , with applications in geodesy , geomatics , archaeology , geography , geology , geomorphology , seismology , forestry , atmospheric physics , laser guidance , airborne laser swath mapping ( ALSM ) , and laser altimetry . The technology is also used in control and navigation for some autonomous cars .",
  "/wiki/Infrared": "Infrared radiation ( IR ) , sometimes called infrared light , is electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light . It is therefore generally invisible to the human eye , although IR at wavelengths up to 1050 nanometers ( nm ) s from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions . IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers ( frequency 430 THz ) , to 1 millimeter ( 300 GHz ) . Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared . As with all EMR , IR carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle , the photon . Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William Herschel , who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light , by means of its effect on a thermometer . Slightly more than half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually found to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared . The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on Earth 's climate . Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements . It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment , making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry . Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range . Infrared radiation is used in industrial , scientific , military , law enforcement , and medical applications .",
  "/wiki/Ultrashort_pulse": "In optics , an ultrashort pulse of light is an electromagnetic pulse whose time duration is of the order of a picosecond ( 10\u221212 second ) or less . Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum , and can be created by mode-locked oscillators . They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events . Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification , in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier . They are characterized by a high peak intensity ( or more correctly , irradiance ) that usually leads to nonlinear interactions in various materials , including air . These processes are studied in the field of nonlinear optics . In the specialized literature , ultrashort refers to the femtosecond ( fs ) and picosecond ( ps ) range , although such pulses no longer hold the record for the shortest pulses artificially generated . Indeed , x-ray pulses with durations on the attosecond time scale have been reported . The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ahmed H. Zewail , for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur , opening up the field of femtochemistry .",
  "/wiki/Thulium": "Thulium is a chemical element with the symbol Tm and atomic number 69 . It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the lanthanide series . Like the other lanthanides , the most common oxidation state is +3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds ; because it occurs so late in the series , however , the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results . In aqueous solution , like compounds of other late lanthanides , soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules . In 1879 , the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components , which he called holmia and thulia ; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium , respectively . A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911 . Thulium is the second-least abundant of the lanthanides , after radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities on Earth . It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster . It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air . Despite its high price and rarity , thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices , and in some solid-state lasers . It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic .",
  "/wiki/Ytterbium": "Ytterbium is a chemical element with the symbol Yb and atomic number 70 . It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series , which is the basis of the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state . However , like the other lanthanides , its most common oxidation state is +3 , as in its oxide , halides , and other compounds . In aqueous solution , like compounds of other late lanthanides , soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules . Because of its closed-shell electron configuration , its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides . In 1878 , the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated from the rare earth erbia another independent component , which he called ytterbia , for Ytterby , the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium . He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium ( in total , four elements were named after the village , the others being yttrium , terbium and erbium ) . In 1907 , the new earth lutecia was separated from ytterbia , from which the element lutecium ( now lutetium ) was extracted by Georges Urbain , Carl Auer von Welsbach , and Charles James . After some discussion , Marignac 's name ytterbium was retained . A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953 . At present , ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media , and less often as a gamma ray source . Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes , which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million .",
  "/wiki/Laser_cooling": "Laser cooling refers to a number of techniques in which atomic and molecular samples are cooled down to near absolute zero . Laser cooling techniques rely on the fact that when an object ( usually an atom ) absorbs and re-emits a photon ( a particle of light ) its momentum changes . For an ensemble of particles , their thermodynamic temperature is proportional to the variance in their velocity . That is , more homogeneous velocities among particles corresponds to a lower temperature . Laser cooling techniques combine atomic spectroscopy with the aforementioned mechanical effect of light to compress the velocity distribution of an ensemble of particles , thereby cooling the particles .",

  "/wiki/Telecommunication": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",
  "/wiki/Holmium": "Holmium is a chemical element with the symbol Ho and atomic number 67 . Part of the lanthanide series , holmium is a rare-earth element . Holmium was discovered through isolation by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve and independently by Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine who observed it spectroscopically in 1878 . Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores by Cleve in 1878 . The element 's name comes from Holmia , the Latin name for the city of Stockholm . Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metal . It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature , but when isolated , is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature . However , it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated . Holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion-exchange techniques . Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized , containing Ho ( III ) ions . Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions ( while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines ) , and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications . Holmium has the highest magnetic permeability of any element and therefore is used for the polepieces of the strongest static magnets .",
  "/wiki/Kidney_stone": "Kidney stone disease , also known as urolithiasis , is when a solid piece of material ( kidney stone ) develops in the urinary tract . Kidney stones typically form in the kidney and leave the body in the urine stream . A small stone may pass without causing symptoms . If a stone grows to more than 5 millimeters ( 0.2 in ) , it can cause blockage of the ureter , resulting in severe pain in the lower back or abdomen . A stone may also result in blood in the urine , vomiting , or painful urination . About half of people who have had a kidney stone will have another within ten years . Most stones form due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors . Risk factors include high urine calcium levels ; obesity ; certain foods ; some medications ; calcium supplements ; hyperparathyroidism ; gout and not drinking enough fluids . Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration . The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms , urine testing , and medical imaging . Blood tests may also be useful . Stones are typically classified by their location : nephrolithiasis ( in the kidney ) , ureterolithiasis ( in the ureter ) , cystolithiasis ( in the bladder ) , or by what they are made of ( calcium oxalate , uric acid , struvite , cystine ) .",
  "/wiki/Dentistry": "Dentistry , also known as dental medicine and oral medicine , is a branch of medicine that consists of the study , diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of diseases , disorders , and conditions of the oral cavity , commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa , and of adjacent and related structures and tissues , particularly in the maxillofacial ( jaw and facial ) area . Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public , the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting , muscular , lymphatic , nervous , vascular , and anatomical structures . Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology ( the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases ) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. [ where ? ] Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team , which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries ( dental assistants , dental hygienists , dental technicians , as well as dental therapists ) . Most dentists either work in private practices ( primary care ) , dental hospitals or ( secondary care ) institutions ( prisons , armed forces bases , etc. ) . The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC . Remains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization ( c. 3300 BC ) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years . It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from medicine .

Chromium is the main additive in stainless steel , to which it adds anti-corrosive properties . Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing . Polished chromium reflects almost 70 % of the visible spectrum , with almost 90 % of infrared light being reflected . The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 , chr\u014dma , meaning color , because many chromium compounds are intensely colored . Ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium . Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness . A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel . Stainless steel and chrome plating ( electroplating with chromium ) together comprise 85 % of the commercial use .

Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and must be stored in mineral oil . When cut , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals , which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride . The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light : it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common .

  "/wiki/Copper_vapor_laser": "Copper vapor laser ( CVL ) uses vapors of copper as the lasing medium in a 3-level laser . It produces green laser light at 510.6 nm and yellow laser light at 578.2 nm . The pulse width is typically from 5 to 60 ns , and peak power from 50 to 5000 kW . Its pulse repetition frequencies can be 2 to 100 kHz . The average power of CVLs can range from 25 W to more than 2 kW . It is one of the lasers that can be home built . Lasers using pure metal vapor produced from an elemental copper source are difficult to construct because of the extremely high temperature , about 1500 \u00b0C , necessary to create such vapor , severely limiting the materials for the vapor containment vessel and mirrors . Copper halides , specifically copper chloride , copper bromide and copper iodide , have been substituted since they form vapors at much lower temperatures , in the range 300 \u00b0C - 600 \u00b0C , but operation at such temperatures remains difficult . Copper compound vapors also increase the complexity of the pump signal applied to the device . Typically , two energizing pulses in quick succession are required , the first to dissociate vapor molecules , and the second to cause the dissociated ions to lase . Operating temperature can be further reduced by the use of copper nitrate or copper acetylacetonate , whose vapors give peak laser output power at 180 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C , respectively .

Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3 . In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium ( 60 ) and samarium ( 62 ) ; this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley , who , having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known , found that atomic number 61 was missing . In 1926 , two groups ( one Italian and one American ) claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61 ; both discoveries were soon proven to be false . In 1938 , during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University , a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium , but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced , and the discovery was not generally recognized . Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor . The discoverers proposed the name prometheum ( the spelling was subsequently changed ) , derived from Prometheus , the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans , to symbolize both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind 's intellect .

  "/wiki/Chrysoberyl": "The mineral or gemstone chrysoberyl is an aluminate of beryllium with the formula BeAl2O4 .

Despite the similarity of their names , chrysoberyl and beryl are two completely different gemstones , although they both contain beryllium . Chrysoberyl is the third-hardest frequently encountered natural gemstone and lies at 8.5 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness , between corundum ( 9 ) and topaz ( 8 ) . An interesting feature of its crystals are the cyclic twins called trillings . These twinned crystals have a hexagonal appearance , but are the result of a triplet of twins with each twin oriented at 120\u00b0 to its neighbors and taking up 120\u00b0 of the cyclic trilling . If only two of the three possible twin orientations are present , a V-shaped twin results . Ordinary chrysoberyl is yellowish-green and transparent to translucent . When the mineral exhibits good pale green to yellow color and is transparent , then it is used as a gemstone . The three main varieties of chrysoberyl are : ordinary yellow-to-green chrysoberyl , cat 's eye or cymophane , and alexandrite . Yellow-green chrysoberyl was referred to as chrysolite during the Victorian and Edwardian eras , which caused confusion since that name has also been used for the mineral olivine ( peridot as a gemstone ) ; that name is no longer used in the gemological nomenclature . Alexandrite , a strongly pleochroic ( trichroic ) gem , will exhibit emerald green , red and orange-yellow colors depending on viewing direction in partially polarised light .",

The name is also often used erroneously to describe synthetically-grown corundum . Most true synthetic Alexandrite is grown by pulling , known as the Czochralski method . Another method is a floating zone . This method was developed by an Armenian scientist , Khachatur Saakovich Bagdasarov , of the Russian ( former Soviet ) Institute of Crystallography , in Moscow , in 1964 , and was widely used in production of white YAG for spacecraft and submarine illuminators , before finding its way into the jewelry market . Alexandrite crystals grown by floating zone method tend to have less intensity in color than crystals grown by the pulled method . Flux-grown alexandrite is more difficult to identify because the inclusions of undissolved flux can look like natural inclusions . Alexandrite grown by the flux-melt process will contain particles of flux , resembling liquid feathers with a refractive index and specific gravity that echo that of the natural material . Layers of dust-like particles parallel to the seed plate , and strong banding or growth lines may also be apparent . Some stones contain groups of parallel negative crystals . Flux grown alexandrites are more difficult to spot because the colors are convincing and because they are not clean . These stones are expensive to make and are grown in platinum crucibles .",

A heavy , silvery d-block element , mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure ; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine , though metals such as caesium , gallium , and rubidium melt just above room temperature . Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) . The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide . Mercury is used in thermometers , barometers , manometers , sphygmomanometers , float valves , mercury switches , mercury relays , fluorescent lamps and other devices , though concerns about the element 's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments . Likewise , mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers . Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales . It is also used in fluorescent lighting . Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light , which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce , making visible light .

Information is carried in the varying duration of the on and off periods of the signal , for example by Morse code in early radio . In early wireless telegraphy radio transmission , CW waves were also known as undamped waves , to distinguish this method from damped wave signals produced by earlier spark gap type transmitters .",

  "/wiki/Erbium": "Erbium is a chemical element with the symbol Er and atomic number 68 . A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated , natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements . It is a lanthanide , a rare earth element , originally found in the gadolinite mine in Ytterby in Sweden , from which it got its name . Erbium 's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er3+ ions , which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications . Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media , where Er3+ ions are optically pumped at around 980 or 1480 nm and then radiate light at 1530 nm in stimulated emission . This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics . The 1550 nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength . In addition to optical fiber amplifier-lasers , a large variety of medical applications ( i.e . dermatology , dentistry ) rely on the erbium ion 's 2940 nm emission ( see Er : YAG laser ) when lit at another wavelength , which is highly absorbed in water in tissues , making its effect very superficial . Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery , and for the efficient production of steam which produces enamel ablation by common types of dental laser .",
  "/wiki/Optical_amplifier": "An optical amplifier is a device that amplifies an optical signal directly , without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal . An optical amplifier may be thought of as a laser without an optical cavity , or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed . Optical amplifiers are important in optical communication and laser physics . They are used as optical repeaters in the long distance fiberoptic cables which carry much of the world 's telecommunication links . There are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a light signal , which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers . In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers , stimulated emission in the amplifier 's gain medium causes amplification of incoming light . In semiconductor optical amplifiers ( SOAs ) , electron-hole recombination occurs . In Raman amplifiers , Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain medium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons . Parametric amplifiers use parametric amplification .",
  "/wiki/Telecommunications": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",
  "/wiki/Uranium": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable ; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 % of uranium on Earth ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite . In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739-99.2752 % ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198-0.7202 % ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050-0.0059 % ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties .",
