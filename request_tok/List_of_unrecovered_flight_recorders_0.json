All 30 people on board perished , including Clarence Clancy Sayen , the former president of the Air Line Pilots Association . There was no indication of any unusual problem prior to impact . A definitive cause was not determined by National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigators . However , it was believed that the crash was most likely the result of the pilots misreading their three-pointer ( 3p ) altimeters by 10,000 feet . At the time of the accident , United Airlines had 39 other 727s in its fleet ( of the 247 Boeing 727s ordered ) , all of which were 727-100 ( 727-22 ) .

Intended for short and medium-length flights , the 727 can use relatively short runways at smaller airports . It has three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines below a T-tail , one on each side of the rear fuselage with a center engine that connects through an S-duct to an inlet at the base of the fin . The 727 is the only Boeing trijet to enter commercial production . The 727 followed the 707 , a quad-jet airliner , with which it shares its upper fuselage cross-section and cockpit design . The 727-100 first flew in February 1963 and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in February 1964 ; the stretched 727-200 flew in July 1967 and entered service with Northeast Airlines that December . The 727 became a mainstay of airlines ' domestic route networks and was also used on short- and medium-range international routes . Passenger , freighter , and convertible versions of the 727 were built . The highest production rate of the 727 was in the 1970s ; the last 727 was completed in 1984 .

Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

  "/wiki/Boeing_707-323C": "The Boeing 707 is an American mid-sized , mid- to long-range , narrow-body airliner with four engines built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1958 to 1979 . Versions of the aircraft have a capacity from 140 to 219 passengers and a range of 2,500 to 5,750 nautical miles ( 2,880 to 6,620 mi ; 4,630 to 10,650 km ) . Developed as Boeing 's first jet airliner , the 707 is a swept-wing design with podded engines . Although it was not the first jetliner in service , the 707 was the first to be commercially successful . Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s and remaining common through the 1970s , the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age . It established Boeing as one of the largest manufacturers of passenger aircraft , and led to the later series of airliners with 7x7 designations . The later 720 , 727 , 737 , and 757 share elements of the 707 's fuselage design . The 707 was developed from the Boeing 367-80 , a prototype jet first flown in 1954 . A larger fuselage cross-section and other modifications resulted in the initial-production 707-120 , powered by Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines , which first flew on December 20 , 1957 . Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26 , 1958 . Later derivatives included the shortened long-range 707-138 , hot and high 707-220 and the stretched 707-320 , all of which entered service in 1959 . A smaller short-range variant , the 720 , was introduced in 1960 .",

The aircraft was also produced under licence in Romania during the 1980s as the Rombac One-Eleven . The One-Eleven was conceived by Hunting Aircraft and developed by the British Aircraft Corporation when Hunting merged into BAC along with other British aircraft manufacturers in 1960 . The One-Eleven was intended to replace the turboprop Vickers Viscount on short-range routes . The One-Eleven entered the market ahead of rivals such as the Douglas DC-9-10 , which gave it a temporary edge on the market . The aircraft proved popular with domestic airlines and various international operators . Over half of the One-Eleven 's sales at launch were to the US . The One-Eleven was one of the most successful British airliner designs , and served until a widespread retirement in the 1990s , which was partly due to the introduction of aircraft noise restrictions in many European nations .

Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

The first wide-body airplane produced , it was the first plane dubbed a Jumbo Jet . Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . The 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing expected supersonic airliners - the development of which was announced in the early 1960s - to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , production passed 1,000 in 1993 .

The incident occurred during the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War , which had been ongoing for nearly eight years . Vincennes had entered Iranian territory after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits . The reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries . According to the U.S. , the Vincennes crew had incorrectly identified the Airbus as an attacking F-14 Tomcat , a U.S.-made jet fighter that had been part of the Iranian Air Force inventory since the 1970s . While the F-14s had been supplied to Iran in an air-to-air configuration , the Vincennes crew had been briefed that the Iranian F-14s were equipped with air-to-ground ordnance . Vincennes had made ten attempts to contact the aircraft both on military and on civilian frequencies , but had received no response . According to Iran , the cruiser negligently shot down the aircraft , which was transmitting IFF squawks in Mode III , a signal that identified it as a civilian aircraft , and not Mode II as used by Iranian military aircraft .

Some Arab governments refer to it as the Arabian Gulf ( Arabic : \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0652\u062c\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 , romanized : Al-Khal\u012bj al-\u02c1Arab\u012b ) or The Gulf , but neither term is recognized globally . The name Gulf of Iran ( Persian Gulf ) is used by the International Hydrographic Organization . The Persian Gulf was a battlefield of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War , in which each side attacked the other 's oil tankers . It is the namesake of the 1991 Gulf War , the largely air- and land-based conflict that followed Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait . The Persian Gulf has many fishing grounds , extensive reefs ( mostly rocky , but also coral ) , and abundant pearl oysters , but its ecology has been damaged by industrialization and oil spills . The Persian Gulf is in the Persian Gulf Basin , which is of Cenozoic origin and related to the subduction of the Arabian Plate under the Zagros Mountains . The current flooding of the basin started 15,000 years ago due to rising sea levels of the Holocene glacial retreat .",

  "/wiki/Fokker_F28_Fellowship": "The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engine short range jet airliner designed and built by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker . Following the Fokker F27 Friendship , an early and commercially successful turboprop-powered regional airliner , Fokker decided to embark on developing a new turbojet-powered commuter aircraft that would build upon its experiences with the F27 . During the design phase , a high level of attention was paid to market research and operator concerns ; amongst other changes made , the prospective jetliner was increased in size , changing its maximum seating capacity from 50 to 65 passengers . During April 1962 , Fokker announced the formal launch of the F28 Fellowship . On 9 May 1967 , the prototype F28-1000 conducted its maiden flight . Type certification was achieved on 24 February 1969 , and the first revenue-earning flight by Braathens was performed on 28 March 1969 . Following its entry to service , Fokker developed multiple variants of the F28 ; one model , the F28-2000 , featured an extended fuselage that could accommodate up to 79 passengers . A major revision was the F28-4000 , which was powered by quieter Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H engines , a redesigned cockpit , a modified wing , and had a further increased seating capacity of up to 85 passengers . During 1987 , production of the type was terminated in favour of two newer derivatives , the Fokker 70 and the larger Fokker 100 .",

  "/wiki/Ferry_flying": "Ferry flying is the flying of aircraft for the purpose of returning to base , delivery to customer when new , moving from one base of operations to another or moving to or from a maintenance facility for maintenance , repair , and operations . An aircraft may need to be moved without passengers from one airport to another at the end of that day 's operations in order to satisfy the next day 's timetable - these are also known as positioning flights . They may also be necessary following a major weather event or other similar disruption which causes multiple cancellations across an airline 's network resulting in many aircraft and crew being 'out of position ' for normal operations ; the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull or the mass evacuation of US airspace following the 9/11 attacks being significant examples of this .

[ citation needed ] The other neighbourhoods in Amsterdam Zuidoost are Gaasperdam , Bullewijk , Venserpolder and Driemond . The Bijlmermeer neighbourhood , which today houses almost 50,000 people of over 150 nationalities , was designed as a single project as part of a then innovative Modernist approach to urban design . Led by architect Siegfried Nassuth and team , the original neighbourhood was designed as a series of nearly identical high-rise buildings laid out in a hexagonal grid . The goal was to create open spaces for recreation at grade , elevated roads to reduce pollution and traffic from those same recreation areas , and residences climbing upward offering residents views , clean air , and sunlight . The apartments were meant to attract a suburban population , in the manner of condominium housing . The buildings have several features that distinguish them from traditional Dutch high-rise flats , such as tubular walkways connecting the flats and garages . The blocks are separated by large green areas planted with grass and trees . Each flat has its own garages where cars can be parked . The Bijlmer was designed with two levels of traffic .

Located a few degrees south of the Equator , Rwanda is bordered by Uganda , Tanzania , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Rwanda is in the African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated ; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east , with numerous lakes throughout the country . The climate is temperate to subtropical , with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year . Rwanda has a population of over 12.6 million living on 26,338 sq . km of land , and therefore it is the most densely populated mainland African country . The population is young and predominantly rural , with a density among the highest in Africa . Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group , the Banyarwanda , although within this group there are three subgroups : the Hutu , Tutsi and Twa . The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people and are often considered descendants of Rwanda 's earliest inhabitants . Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi ; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people , while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately , and from different locations . Christianity is the largest religion in the country ; the principal language is Kinyarwanda , spoken by most Rwandans , with English and French serving as additional official languages . The sovereign state of Rwanda has a presidential system of government ."
