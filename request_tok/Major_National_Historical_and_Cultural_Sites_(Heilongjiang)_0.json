The Jin emerged from Taizu 's rebellion against the Liao dynasty ( 907-1125 ) , which held sway over northern China until the nascent Jin drove the Liao to the Western Regions , where they became known as the Western Liao . After vanquishing the Liao , the Jurchen Jin launched an over hundred-year struggles against the Chinese Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , which was based in southern China . Over the course of their rule , the Jurchens of Jin quickly adapted to Chinese customs , and even fortified the Great Wall against the rising Mongols . Domestically , the Jin oversaw a number of cultural advancements , such as the revival of Confucianism . After spending centuries as vassals of the Jin , the Mongols invaded under Genghis Khan in 1211 and inflicted catastrophic defeats on the Jin armies .

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems",

Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu .

A lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal . With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network , it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou , and to the northern border near modern Beijing . While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital , and for transporting troops and military logistics , the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades , flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries . Along with the extension of the Great Wall , and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang , these mega projects , led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy , would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base , at heavy cost of human lives . After a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , ended in defeat by 614 , the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618",
  "/wiki/Liao_dynasty": "The Liao dynasty ( /lja\u028a/ ; Khitan : Mos J\u00e6lud ; traditional Chinese : \u907c\u671d ; simplified Chinese : \u8fbd\u671d ; pinyin : Li\u00e1o ch\u00e1o ) , also known as the Liao Empire , officially the Great Liao ( \u5927\u907c ; \u5927\u8fbd ; D\u00e0 Li\u00e1o ) , or the Khitan ( Qidan ) State ( Khitan : Mos diau-d kitai huld\u0292i gur ) , was an empire and imperial dynasty in East Asia that ruled from 916 to 1125 over present-day Northern and Northeast China , Mongolia and portions of the Russian Far East and North Korea . The empire was founded by Yel\u00fc Abaoji ( Emperor Taizu of Liao ) , Khagan of the Khitans around the time of the collapse of the Tang dynasty and was the first state to control all of Manchuria . Being ruled by the Khitan Yel\u00fc clan , the Liao dynasty is considered by historians to be a conquest dynasty of China . Almost immediately after its founding , the Liao dynasty began a process of territorial expansion , with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae . Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Later Tang ( 923-936 ) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo after losing the Goryeo-Khitan Wars . In 1004 , the Liao dynasty launched an imperial expedition against the Northern Song dynasty . After heavy fighting and large casualties between the two empires , both sides worked out the Chanyuan Treaty . Through the treaty , the Liao dynasty forced the Northern Song to recognize them as peers and heralded an era of peace and stability between the two powers that lasted approximately 120 years . Tension between traditional Khitan social and political practices and Chinese influence and customs was a defining feature of the dynasty . This tension led to a series of succession crises ; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture , while much of the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate . So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments . The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices , while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations , adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices",

It followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty . Although the Mongols had ruled territories including modern-day North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style , and the conquest was not complete until 1279 when the Southern Song dynasty was defeated in the Battle of Yamen . His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other Mongol khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia . It was the first non-Han Chinese dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan forces . Following that , the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule as the Northern Yuan dynasty . Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language , while others only used their native language ( i.e . Mongolian ) and the 'Phags-pa script . The Yuan dynasty was the khanate ruled by the successors of M\u00f6ngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire . In official Chinese histories , the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven . The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan , yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu . [ note 3 ] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name , Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty",
