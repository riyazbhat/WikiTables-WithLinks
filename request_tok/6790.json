It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

The demography of the Albania is monitored by the Institute of Statistics of Albania . The institute has performed demographic censuses since the 1924s . The latest census in Albania was performed in April 2011 , and has been deemed as unreliable both within and outside Albania . Albania is a fairly linguistically homogeneous country with ethnic Albanians forming the majority in the country . Albania has 2,876,591 inhabitants according to the INSTAT calculations current as of January 1 , 2017 . The first official population statistics for Albania was the 1923 census , when the country had a total of 823,000 inhabitants . Previous censuses carried out by the Ottoman Empire , which are not yet available . A shift in administrative borders in 1913 made comparison of various periods more complicated . Maddison from 2001 , estimates that in Albania , about 200,000 people lived up to the year 1600 , and that the population grew to 300,000 by 1700 , implying an annual average growth rate of 0.4 % in that period . However , population growth accelerated from the declaration of independence in 1912 to 1944 to 0.7 % per year . This was due in part because Albania had the largest birth rate and the smallest death rate in Europe at the time .",

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk . Over 40 % of its 207,600 square kilometres ( 80,200 sq mi ) is forested . Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing . Until the 20th century , different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus , including the Principality of Polotsk ( 11th to 14th centuries ) , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and the Russian Empire . In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution , Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People 's Republic , which was conquered by Soviet Russia . The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) . Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 . Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland , and were finalized after World War II . During WWII , military operations devastated Belarus , which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources . The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years . In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations , along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR .",

  "/wiki/Net_migration_rate": "The net migration rate is the difference between the number of immigrants ( people coming into an area ) and the number of emigrants ( people leaving an area ) throughout the year . When the number of immigrants is larger than the number of emigrants , a positive net migration rate occurs . A positive net migration rates indicates that there are more people entering than leaving an area . When more emigrate from a country , the result is a negative net migration rate , meaning that more people are leaving than entering the area . When there is an equal number of immigrants and emigrants , the net migration rate is balanced . The net migration rate is calculated over a one-year period using the mid year population and a ratio . Migration occurs over a series of different push and pull factors that revolve around social , political , economical , and environmental factors according to Migration Trends . Social migration is when an individual migrates to have a higher standard of living , to be closer to family or to live in a nation with which they identify more . Political migration then is when a person is going in as a refugee to escape war or political persecution . This form of migration is also can also be called forced migration . This happens when refugees are moving to neighboring countries or more developed countries . Neighboring countries , especially the ones in the middle east are depended on to shelter the refugees .",
  "/wiki/War_in_Donbass": "The War in Donbass is an armed conflict in the Donbass region of Ukraine . From the beginning of March 2014 , protests by Russian-backed anti-government groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine , commonly collectively called the Donbass , in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Euromaidan movement . These demonstrations , which followed the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation ( February to March 2014 ) , and which were part of a wider group of concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine , escalated into an armed conflict between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People 's Republics ( DPR and LPR respectively ) , and the Ukrainian government . In the Donetsk People 's Republic , from May 2014 until a change of the top leadership in August 2014 , some of the top leaders were Russian citizens . According to the Ukrainian government , at the height of the conflict in mid-2014 , Russian paramilitaries were reported to make up between 15 % to 80 % of the combatants . Between 22 and 25 August 2014 , Russian artillery , personnel , and what Russia called a humanitarian convoy crossed the border into Ukrainian territory without permission of the Ukrainian government . Crossings occurred both in areas under the control of pro-Russian forces and in areas that were not under their control , such as the south-eastern part of Donetsk Oblast , near Novoazovsk . These events followed the reported shelling of Ukrainian positions from the Russian side of the border over the course of the preceding month . Head of the Security Service of Ukraine , Valentyn Nalyvaichenko characterised the events of 22 August as a direct invasion by Russia of Ukraine , while other western and Ukrainian officials described the events as a stealth invasion of Ukraine by Russia . Russia 's official position on the presence of Russian forces in Donbass has been vague : while official bodies have denied presence of regular armed forces in Ukraine , it has on numerous occasions confirmed presence of military specialists , along with other euphemisms , usually accompanied by an argument that Russia was forced to deploy them to defend the Russian-speaking population . As a result of the August 2014 events , DPR and LPR insurgents regained much of the territory they had lost during the Ukrainian government 's preceding military offensive . Ukraine , Russia , the DPR and the LPR signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire , called the Minsk Protocol , on 5 September 2014 .",

Bosnia and Herzegovina is an almost landlocked country - to the south it has a narrow coast on the Adriatic Sea , about 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) long and surrounding the town of Neum . It is bordered by Serbia to the east , Montenegro to the southeast , and Croatia surrounding north and southwest . In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous , in the northwest moderately hilly , and the northeast predominantly flatland . The inland , Bosnia , is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate , with hot summers and cold and snowy winters . The southern tip , Herzegovina , has a Mediterranean climate and mostly mountainous topography . Bosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age , during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations . Culturally , politically , and socially , the country has a rich history , having been first settled by the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries . In the 12th century the Banate of Bosnia was established , which evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century , after which it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire , under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries . The Ottomans brought Islam to the region , and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country . This was followed by annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy , which lasted up until World War I .",

Following a number of violent incidents in early 1992 , the war is commonly viewed as having started on 6 April 1992 . The war ended on 14 December 1995 . The main belligerents were the forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and those of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina , Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosnia , which were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia , respectively . The war was part of the breakup of Yugoslavia . Following the Slovenian and Croatian secessions from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991 , the multi-ethnic Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina - which was inhabited by mainly Muslim Bosniaks ( 44 percent ) , as well as Orthodox Serbs ( 32.5 percent ) and Catholic Croats ( 17 percent ) - passed a referendum for independence on 29 February 1992 . This was rejected by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs , who had boycotted the referendum . Following Bosnia and Herzegovina 's declaration of independence ( which gained international recognition ) and following the withdrawal of Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 from the previously signed Cutileiro Plan ( which proposed a division of Bosnia into ethnic cantons ) , the Bosnian Serbs , led by Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and supported by the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) , mobilised their forces inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure ethnic Serb territory , then war soon spread across the country , accompanied by ethnic cleansing . The conflict was initially between the Yugoslav Army units in Bosnia which later transformed into the Army of Republika Srpska ( VRS ) on the one side , and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) which was largely composed of Bosniaks , and the Croat forces in the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) on the other side . Tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased throughout late 1992 , resulting in the Croat-Bosniak War that escalated in early 1993 . The Bosnian War was characterised by bitter fighting , indiscriminate shelling of cities and towns , ethnic cleansing and systematic mass rape , mainly perpetrated by Serb , and to a lesser extent , Croat and Bosniak forces . Events such as the Siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre later became iconic of the conflict .",

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

Croatia has an area of 56,594 square kilometres ( 21,851 square miles ) and a population of 4.28 million , most of whom are Roman Catholics . Croatia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Age . The Croats arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century . Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke Branimir . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom , which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries . During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended , Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne . In October 1918 , in the final days of World War I , the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , independent from Austria-Hungary , was proclaimed in Zagreb , and in December 1918 it was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ) .

A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country , while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia , supported by Serbia , opposed the secession and wanted Serb-claimed lands to be in a common state with Serbia . Most Serbs sought a new Serb state within a Yugoslav federation , including areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina with ethnic Serb majorities or significant minorities , and attempted to conquer as much of Croatia as possible . Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991 , but agreed to postpone it with the Brioni Agreement and cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991 . The JNA initially tried to keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia . After this failed , Serb forces established the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) within Croatia . After the ceasefire of January 1992 and international recognition of the Republic of Croatia as a sovereign state , the front lines were entrenched , the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) was deployed , and combat became largely intermittent in the following three years .

Georgia is a unitary parliamentary republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy . During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia , such as Colchis and Iberia . The Georgians officially adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . The Georgian Orthodox Church had enormous importance for the spiritual and political unification of early Georgian states . The unified Kingdom of Georgia reached its Golden Age during the reign of King David the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great in the 12th and early 13th centuries . Thereafter , the kingdom declined and eventually disintegrated under the hegemony of various regional powers , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire and successive dynasties of Iran .",

It covers 8,660 square kilometres ( 3,340 sq mi ) and has a population of around 240,000 . Its capital is Sukhumi . The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Georgia-Russia relations . The polity is recognised as a state by Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru and Syria . While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia , the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia legally part of Georgia , whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia . The region had autonomy within Soviet Georgia at the time when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s . Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz - the region 's titular ethnicity - and Georgians - the largest single ethnic group at that time - culminated in the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia which resulted in Georgia 's loss of control of most of Abkhazia , the de facto independence of Abkhazia , and the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia . Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations , the dispute remains unresolved . The long-term presence of a United Nations Observer Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force failed to prevent the flare-up of violence on several occasions . In August 2008 , Abkhaz and Russian forces fought a war against Georgian forces , which led to the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia , the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement , and the termination of the UN mission .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

At the beginning of year 2017 , Italy had an estimated population of 60.4 million . Its population density , at 201 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 520/sq mi ) , is higher than that of most Western European countries . However , the distribution of the population is widely uneven ; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley ( that accounts for almost half of the national population ) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy , while other vast areas are very sparsely populated , like the plateaus of Basilicata , the Alps and Apennines highlands , and the island of Sardinia . The population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century , but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North , a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950-60 's . In addition , after centuries of net emigration , from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history . According to the Italian government , there were an estimated 5,234,000 foreign nationals resident in Italy on 1st of January 2019 . High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s , after which they started to dramatically decline , leading to rapid population aging . At the end of the first decade of the 21st century , one in five Italians was over 65 years old . However , as a result of the massive immigration of the last two decades , Italy has , in recent years , experienced a significant growth in birth rates . The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008 . Since the 1984 Lateran Treaty agreement , Italy has no official religion .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a democratic sovereign state , parliamentary republic and a very highly developed country according to the United Nations Human Development Index .",

The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix .

Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

The capital city is Chi\u0219in\u0103u . Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812 , when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire ( to which Moldavia was a vassal state ) and became known as Bessarabia . In 1856 , southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia , which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania , but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878 . During the 1917 Russian Revolution , Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic , known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic . In February 1918 , the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly . The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia , which in 1924 established , within the Ukrainian SSR , a Moldavian autonomous republic ( MASSR ) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia . In 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union , leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Moldavian SSR ) , which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR ( east of the Dniester River ) . On 27 August 1991 , as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway , the Moldavian SSR declared independence and took the name Moldova . The constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994 . The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990 . Due to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the service sector has grown to dominate Moldova 's economy and is over 60 % of the nation 's GDP .",

After the dissolution of the USSR , tensions between Moldova and the breakaway Transnistrian territory escalated into a military conflict that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a ceasefire in July of the same year . As part of that agreement , a three-party ( Russia , Moldova , Transnistria ) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the demilitarised zone , comprising twenty localities on both sides of the river . Although the ceasefire has held , the territory 's political status remains unresolved : Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent semi-presidential republic with its own government , parliament , military , police , postal system , currency and vehicle registration . Its authorities have adopted a constitution , flag , national anthem and coat of arms . It is the only country still using the hammer and sickle on its flag , despite not being a communist state .

  "/wiki/Puerto_Rico": "Puerto Rico [ a ] ( Spanish for Rich Port ; abbreviated PR ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Maria": "Hurricane Maria was a deadly Category 5 hurricane that devastated Dominica , St Croix , and Puerto Rico in September 2017 . It is regarded as the worst natural disaster in recorded history to affect those islands and was also the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Mitch in 1998 . The tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 , Maria was the thirteenth named storm , eighth consecutive hurricane , fourth major hurricane , second Category 5 hurricane , and deadliest storm of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season . At its peak , the hurricane caused catastrophic destruction and numerous fatalities across the northeastern Caribbean , compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the Leeward Islands already struck by Hurricane Irma . Total losses from the hurricane are estimated at upwards of $ 91.61 billion ( 2017 USD ) , mostly in Puerto Rico , ranking it as the third-costliest tropical cyclone on record . Originating from a tropical wave , Maria became a tropical storm on September 16 , east of the Lesser Antilles . Highly favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc . The hurricane reached Category 5 strength on September 18 just before making landfall on Dominica , becoming the first Category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island . After weakening slightly due to crossing Dominica , Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph ( 280 km/h ) and a pressure of 908 mbar ( hPa ; 26.81 inHg ) . On September 20 , an eyewall replacement cycle took place , weakening Maria to a high-end Category 4 hurricane by the time it struck Puerto Rico . Interaction with land further weakened the hurricane , though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the Bahamas . Moving slowly to the north , Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28 .",

  "/wiki/Rate_of_natural_increase": "In demography , the rate of natural increase ( RNI ) is a statistic calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate of a given region . This rate gives demographers an idea of how a certain country 's population is growing . RNI excludes in-migration and out-migration , giving an indication of population growth based only on births and deaths . RNI can indicate what stage of the Demographic Transition Model ( DTM ) a country is in . Trends in RNI can predict a country 's economic stability , level of development , and other things . The DTM explains how countries move between being a developing nation to a developed nation . A country 's RNI can help determine which stage of the DTM they are in . This in turn helps policy makers and non-profit organizations , like the United Nations , determine how to allocate aid and resources . Developing countries typically have higher RNI values as they have limited infrastructure and access to healthcare which limits them to unregulated fertility levels . These countries also have higher incidence of disease and poor health outcomes leading to more deaths on top of the already high fertility . Developing countries are therefore in the earlier stages of the DTM with high fertility levels . This leads to developing countries to have high rates of natural increase ."
