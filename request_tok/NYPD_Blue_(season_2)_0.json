  "/wiki/John_Kelly_(NYPD_Blue)": "John Kelly is a fictional character in the television series NYPD Blue , portrayed by David Caruso . The character appeared in the first season and the first four episodes of the second season . An Irish-American who was promoted to the rank of detective at the relatively early age of 28 , Kelly was a brilliant and oft-smoldering cop , whose father was a heroic cop who was murdered in the line of duty . John Kelly Sr. was a member of the previously Irish American-dominated police department who according to fellow officer Jack Hanlon would have made Chief of Detectives had he not been killed . Kelly always managed to stay just on the right side of the law , usually keeping his hotter headed partner Andy Sipowicz under control . This changed when he became involved with a uniformed cop , Janice Licalsi , who murdered a mob boss named Angelo Marino who had ordered her to kill Kelly . Licalsi did this as her father , also a cop , was on the payroll of the mob boss and she was trying to protect him . Eventually Licalsi was investigated and Kelly allowed her to destroy evidence that would have pointed to her involvement in the murder . After Licalsi confessed to killing Marino ( and his bodyguard ) she was tried and sentenced to two years in jail for manslaughter , but was only likely to serve six months -- she and Kelly had become a couple again , and parted with the understanding that they would try for a life together . It became evident to Kelly that he had no future in the job as internal affairs came after him for his role in trying to help Licalsi and his testimony on her behalf . IAB could not find any hard evidence to end his career with , but Captain Haverill , an opponent of the 15th 's detective squad commander , Lieutenant Arthur Fancy , had provoked Kelly into an act of insubordination and had demoted him to radio dispatch work until IAB could find the means to end his career . Kelly refused to accept this and resigned from the force",

Simone was introduced to the squad after Andy Sipowicz 's former partner , John Kelly , was forced to leave the NYPD in the face of an IAB witch hunt . His previous job had been as a driver for the police commissioner , a role that initially riled Sipowicz . However , Simone explained that he had asked for the job so he could spend more time with his wife as she was dying from cancer . An early bond and friendship between them was strong enough that Andy asked Simone to step in after John Kelly could n't make it back to New York for Sipowicz 's wedding to Sylvia Costas . Bobby and Andy became great friends and partners , although Bobby did not let Andy get away with making racist comments around him . It is later learned that Bobby was a quiet kid whose passion for raising racing pigeons came from his friendship with a retired boxer ( who later showed early signs of Alzheimer 's ) , and that he had a flashy older friend named Ray DiSalvo whom he idolized - which came back to haunt him when Ray became a petty criminal and tried unsuccessfully to sell Bobby out to IAB for giving him an implicit warning to avoid a drug bust . In the episode Prostrate Before The Law , season five episode 19 , Simone is dealing with a suspect who assumes he is Puerto Rican . Simone retorts that he is of French and Portuguese descent and that his parents met in Belize . Early on in his time in the squad Simone started a relationship with Diane Russell , another detective at the 15th Precinct . According to NYPD guidelines the police department did not allow such couplings for officers who worked in the same precinct , so the couple kept it quiet up until the point that they were married by a justice of the peace ( Lt Arthur Fancy also knew they were dating , but never officially notified the higher-ups about it )",
