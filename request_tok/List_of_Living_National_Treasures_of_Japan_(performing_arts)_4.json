  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d ( h\u014dgaku ) , meaning literally ( home ) country music ( as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d ( y\u014dgaku ) - Western music ) is the folk or traditional music of Japan . Japan 's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music , such as Gagaku ( court music ) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d ( Buddhist chanting ) , but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku , in a broad sense , as the form from which the others were derived . Outside of ethnomusicology , however , H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century . Within this framework , there are three types of traditional music in Japan : theatrical , court music ( called gagaku ) , and instrumental",

  "/wiki/J\u014druri_(music)": "J\u014druri ( \u6d44\u7460\u7483 ) is a form of traditional Japanese narrative music in which a tay\u016b ( \u592a\u592b ) sings to the accompaniment of a shamisen . As a form of storytelling , the emphasis is on the lyrics and narration rather than the music itself . According to Asai Ry\u014di , the first to have ever employed the shamisen during his storytelling instead of the biwa was chanter Sawazumi . The story he narrated on that occasion was J\u014druri J\u016b-ni-dan z\u014dshi , one of the many existing versions of the J\u014druri Monogatari , which tells the tale of the tragic love between Minamoto no Yoshitsune and J\u014druri-hime . Following this event , every tale sung to the accompaniment of a shamisen is associated with J\u014druri"
