A charismatic and affable speaker in public , he appeared extensively on television during his leadership . During the latter stages of Kennedy 's leadership , there was concern about both his leadership and his health . From December 2005 , some within the party were openly questioning his position and calling for a leadership election . On 5 January 2006 , he was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for alcoholism ; he pre-empted the broadcast by admitting that he had had treatment , and called a leadership election in which he intended to stand . This admission damaged his standing ; 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately , which he did on 7 January ; he was replaced by Menzies Campbell . After resigning as party leader , Kennedy remained in office as a backbench MP . After the 2010 general election he voted against Nick Clegg 's decision to form a coalition with the Conservative Party . On the issue of constitutional reform , he was a long-term supporter of full home rule for Scotland within a federal United Kingdom within a federal Europe . He lost his seat at the 2015 general election and died less than a month later from a haemorrhage linked to his alcoholism ."
