  "/wiki/Sociology": "Sociology is a study of society , patterns of social relationships , social interaction and culture of everyday life . It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order , acceptance , and change or social evolution . Sociology is also defined as the general science of society . While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare , others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes . Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure . The different traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification , social class , social mobility , religion , secularization , law , sexuality , gender , and deviance . As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency , sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects , such as health , medical , economy , military and penal institutions , the Internet , education , social capital , and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge . The range of social scientific methods has also expanded . Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques . The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century led to increasingly interpretative , hermeneutic , and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society . Conversely , the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically , mathematically , and computationally rigorous techniques , such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis . Social research informs politicians and policy makers , educators , planners , legislators , administrators , developers , business magnates , managers , social workers , non-governmental organizations , non-profit organizations , and people interested in resolving social issues in general .",

[ page needed ] Nationalism is often combined with other ideologies , such as conservatism ( national conservatism ) or socialism ( socialist nationalism ) for example . Throughout history , people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions , to territorial authorities and to their homeland , but nationalism did not become a widely recognized concept until the 18th century . There are three paradigms for understanding the origins and basis of nationalism . Primordialism ( perennialism ) proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon . Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic , evolutionary phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols , myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism . Modernism proposes that nationalism is a recent social phenomenon that needs the socio-economic structures of modern society to exist . There are various definitions of a nation , however , which leads to different strands of nationalism .",
