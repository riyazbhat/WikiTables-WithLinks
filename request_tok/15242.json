  "/wiki/Army_of_Lovers_or_Revolt_of_the_Perverts": "Army of Lovers or Revolt of the Perverts ( German : Armee der Liebenden oder Aufstand der Perverse ) is a 1979 German documentary film directed by Rosa von Praunheim . The film , mainly shot in San Francisco , chronicles the rise of gay activism in the United States between 1972 and 1978 in the aftermath of the Stonewall riots and before the arrival of the AIDS epidemic . It explores , among other themes , the initial unity formed post-Stonewall era , splintered into numerous factions . The American gay liberation movement , strengthened by the assault of the Anita Bryant-led anti-gay initiatives , appears foundering into polarization and self-interest groups in an increasingly fractured leadership . The film discusses whether overt sexual expression and promiscuity were helping or hurting the cause of gay rights . Those interviewed include a gay Nazi ; gay porno movie stars ; spokespersons from the Gay Activists Alliance and its more conservative counterpart , the National Gay Task Force ; leaders of the Mattachine society ; the founders of the Daughters of Bilitis ; and novelist John Rechy , who defends gay male promiscuity against the directors contention that what is hurting the gay mens movement is the obsession with discos , baths , and orgy bars . Grace Jones appears at a rally singing I Need A Man and is sharply criticized for doing so by a Lesbian feminist .",

  "/wiki/Stonewall_riots": "The Stonewall riots ( also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion ) were a series of spontaneous , violent demonstrations by members of the gay ( LGBT ) community [ note 1 ] against a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28 , 1969 , at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan , New York City . They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States . Gay Americans in the 1950s and 1960s faced an anti-gay legal system . [ note 2 ] Early homosexual groups in the U.S. sought to prove that gay people could be assimilated into society , and they favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike . The last years of the 1960s , however , were contentious , as many social/political movements were active , including the civil rights movement , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the anti-Vietnam War movement . These influences , along with the liberal environment of Greenwich Village , served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots . Very few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s . Those that did were often bars , although bar owners and managers were rarely gay . At the time , the Stonewall Inn was owned by the Mafia . It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community : butch lesbians , effeminate young men , drag queens , male prostitutes , transgender people , and homeless youth . Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s , but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn . Tensions between New York City police and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening , and again several nights later .",

  "/wiki/Caligula_(film)": "Caligula ( Italian : Caligola ) is a 1979 erotic historical drama film focusing on the rise and fall of the eponymous Roman Emperor Caligula . It stars Malcolm McDowell in the title role , alongside Teresa Ann Savoy , Helen Mirren , Peter O'Toole , John Steiner and John Gielgud . It is the only feature film produced by the men 's magazine Penthouse . Producer Bob Guccione , the magazine 's founder , intended to produce an explicit pornographic film with a feature film narrative and high production values . He also cast Penthouse Pets as extras in unsimulated sex scenes filmed during post-production by himself and Giancarlo Lui . Guccione hired screenwriter Gore Vidal to draft the film 's script and Tinto Brass to direct the film . Brass extensively altered Vidal 's original screenplay , leading Vidal to disavow the film . The final screenplay focuses on the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely . However , both Brass and Vidal disagreed with Guccione 's use of unsimulated sexual content , which Brass refused to film . Because the producers did not allow Brass to edit the film , they changed its tone and style significantly and added hardcore sex scenes not filmed by Brass , thus turning Caligula into a pornographic drama that disregarded the director 's intentions to present the film as a political satire . As a result , Brass also disavowed the film . Caligula 's release was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content .",

With Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier , he was one of the trinity of actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century . A member of the Terry family theatrical dynasty , he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry 's company in 1922 . After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art he worked in repertory theatre and in the West End before establishing himself at the Old Vic as an exponent of Shakespeare in 1929-31 .

  "/wiki/The_Tempest_(play)": "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare , probably written in 1610-1611 , and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone . After the first scene , which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest , the rest of the story is set on a remote island , where the sorcerer Prospero , a complex and contradictory character , lives with his daughter Miranda , and his two servants - Caliban , a savage monster figure , and Ariel , an airy spirit . The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island . It explores many themes , including magic , betrayal , revenge , and family . In Act IV , a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play , and contributes spectacle , allegory , and elevated language . Though The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare 's comedies , it deals with both tragic and comic themes , and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare 's late plays . The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations - from those that see it as a fable of art and creation , with Prospero representing Shakespeare , and Prospero 's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage , to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands .",
  "/wiki/William_Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616 ) [ a ] was an English poet , playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",
