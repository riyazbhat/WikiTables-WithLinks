  "/wiki/Cao_Wei": "Wei ( 220-266 ) , also known as Cao Wei , was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period ( 220-280 ) . With its capital initially located at Xuchang , and thereafter Luoyang , the state was established by Cao Pi in 220 , based upon the foundations laid by his father , Cao Cao , towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty . The name Wei first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213 , and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220 . Historians often add the prefix Cao to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as Wei , such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Northern and Southern dynasties . The authority of the ruling Cao family dramatically weakened in the aftermath of the deposal and execution of Cao Shuang and his siblings , the former being one of the regents for the third Wei emperor , Cao Fang , with state authority gradually falling into the hands of Sima Yi , another Wei regent , and his family , from 249 onwards . The last Wei emperors would remain largely as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi 's grandson , Sima Yan , forced the last Wei ruler , Cao Huan , to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty .",

It previously existed from 220-222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei , its rival state , but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222 . It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler , Sun Quan , declared himself emperor . Its name was derived from the place it was based in - the Jiangnan ( Yangtze River Delta ) region , which was also historically known as Wu . It was referred to as Dong Wu ( Eastern Wu ) or Sun Wu by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region , such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . It was called Eastern Wu because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period , and Sun Wu because the family name of its rulers was Sun . During its existence , Wu 's capital was at Jianye ( present-day Nanjing , Jiangsu ) , but at times it was also at Wuchang ( \u6b66\u660c ; present-day Ezhou , Hubei ) .",

Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei 's state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period . While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei , he is also known for repaying Cao Cao 's kindness by slaying Yan Liang , a general under Cao Cao 's rival Yuan Shao , at the Battle of Boma . After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214 , Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years . In 219 , while he was away fighting Cao Cao 's forces at the Battle of Fancheng , Liu Bei 's ally Sun Quan broke the Sun-Liu alliance and sent his general L\u00fc Meng to conquer Liu Bei 's territories in Jing Province . By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng , it was too late . He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan 's forces and executed . Guan Yu 's life was lionised and his achievements glorified to such an extent after his death that he was deified during the Sui dynasty . Through generations of story telling , culminating in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , his deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis , making Guan Yu one of East Asia 's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness . He is still worshipped by many Chinese people today in mainland China , Taiwan , Tibet , Hong Kong and among many overseas Chinese communities .

In 228 , when Wei 's rival state Shu launched an invasion , Jiang Wei had no choice but to defect to Shu due to the circumstances . Zhuge Liang , the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu , highly regarded Jiang Wei and allowed him to serve as a general in Shu . After Zhuge Liang 's death in 234 , Jiang Wei continued serving as a general during the regencies of Zhuge Liang 's successors , Jiang Wan and Fei Yi . Between 240 and 262 , he continued Zhuge Liang 's legacy of waging war against Wei by leading another 11 military campaigns . However , Jiang Wei failed to make any significant gains from the campaigns as each was ultimately aborted due to inadequate food supplies , heavy losses on the battlefield , or other reasons . The campaigns also severely depleted Shu 's already limited resources and took a toll on the Shu population ; Jiang Wei also incurred much resentment from the people for his warmongering behaviour . While Jiang Wei was away at the frontline , the palace eunuch Huang Hao , whom the Shu emperor Liu Shan favoured , gradually became more influential in Shu 's internal politics . After the 11th campaign in 262 , Jiang Wei suspected that Huang Hao was plotting to remove him from power so he did not return to the capital Chengdu and instead remained in Tazhong . In 263 , when Wei launched a massive invasion of Shu , Jiang Wei led Shu forces to resist the invaders at Tazhong , Yinping and Jiange , but he was caught off guard when the Wei forces under Deng Ai took a shortcut and showed up at Chengdu unexpectedly .
