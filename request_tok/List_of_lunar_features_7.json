  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

He was born in Odessa , then a part of Russia . He studied geology and zoology at the Novorossia University in Odessa . He then traveled across Russia and central Europe to collect fossil specimens . The Challenger expedition of 1872-1876 studied processes of the sea floor . In 1889 Andrusov published a review of this expedition in Gornyi zhurnal ( Mining Journal ) . He would later perform studies of the geology and sediments of the Ponto-Caspian steppe . In 1890-91 he participated in a deep water expedition to the Black Sea by the Russian Geographical Society . This expedition discovered hydrogen sulfide in the lower portions of this sea . Andrusov was the first to propose that this substance was created by biological decomposition of life forms ( bacteria ) containing sulfurous compounds .

After his father died in 1875 , William and his brother inherited this fortune , allowing him to pursue his interest in crystallography without a need to labour for a living . William examined the forms of crystalline structures , and deduced that there were only 230 forms of symmetrical crystal arrangements , known as space groups . His results were published in 1894 , after they had been independently announced by Evgraf Fedorov and Arthur Sch\u00f6nflies , although his approach did display some novelty . His structural models of simple compounds such as NaCl and CsCl were later confirmed using X-ray crystallography .

Stille adhered to the contracting Earth hypothesis and together with Leopold Kober he worked on the geosyncline theory to explain orogeny . Stille 's ideas emerged in the aftermath of Eduard Suess ' book Das Antlitz der Erde ( 1883-1909 ) . Stille 's and Kober 's school of thought was one of two that emerged in the post-Suess era the other being headed by Alfred Wegener and \u00c9mile Argand . This competing view rejected Earth contraction and argued for continental drift . As Stille opposed continental drift he came to be labelled a fixist . Part of Stille 's work dealt with massifs and sedimentary basins in Central Europe ; differing from Suess ' interpretations for the same area showing that between the Bohemian and Rhine massifs Mesozoic rocks were folded . A central tenet in Stille 's geology was that geosynclines became depressions without any faulting with any fault found being the product of later processes like the final collapse of the geosyncline . In 1933 Stille would shorten Leopold Kober 's concept of kratogen , that was used to describe those portions of the continental crust that were old and stable , into kraton ( English : craton ) .

He was a prominent exponent of Arianism and wrote A New Theory of the Earth . Whiston succeeded his mentor Newton as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge . In 1710 he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views . Because Whiston recognized the Bible as a book of spiritual truth , he rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire . He viewed it as absurd and cruel , as well as an insult to God . What especially pitted him against church authorities was his denial of the Trinity after extensive research convinced him of the pagan origin of the Trinity doctrine ."
