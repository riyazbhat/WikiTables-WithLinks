Although deity is the common interpretation of kami , some Shinto scholars argue that such a translation can cause a misunderstanding of the term .

The etymological origin of the word kami is from proto-Japonic kamugami ( \u201e to shine ( into the eye ) ) or kagami ( \u201e mirror ) , and was used to describe the characteristics of the kami . The word was first used during the Yayoi period and linked to the early Japanese culture . The most likely origin comes from old-Japanese kami \u4e0a ( the ones above ) .
