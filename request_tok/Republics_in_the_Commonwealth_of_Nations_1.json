Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west , New Caledonia to the southwest , New Zealand 's Kermadec Islands to the southeast , Tonga to the east , the Samoas and France 's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast , and Tuvalu to the north . Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands - of which 110 are permanently inhabited - and more than 500 islets , amounting to a total land area of about 18,300 square kilometres ( 7,100 sq mi ) . The most outlying island is Ono-i-Lau . The two major islands , Viti Levu and Vanua Levu , account for 87% of the total population of 883,483 . The capital , Suva , on Viti Levu , serves as the country 's principal cruise-ship port . [ failed verification ] About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu 's coasts , either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi - where tourism is the major local industry - or Lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount . Due to its terrain , the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited . The majority of Fiji 's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago . Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",
  "/wiki/Parliamentary_republic": "A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch ( the government ) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature ( the parliament ) . There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics . Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state , with the head of government holding real power , much like constitutional monarchies ( however in some countries the head of state , regardless of whether the country 's system is a parliamentary republic or a constitutional monarchy , has 'reserve powers ' given to use at their discretion in order to act as a non-partisan 'referee ' of the political process and ensure the nation 's constitution is upheld ) . Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government , much like presidential systems , but with a dependency upon parliamentary power . For the first case mentioned above , the form of executive-branch arrangement is distinct from most other governments and semi-presidential republics that separate the head of state ( usually designated as the president ) from the head of government ( usually designated as prime minister , premier or chancellor ) and subject the latter to the confidence of parliament and a lenient tenure in office while the head of state lacks dependency and investing either office with the majority of executive power .

It is the smallest country within mainland Africa . The Gambia is situated on both sides of the lower reaches of the Gambia River , the nation 's namesake , which flows through the centre of The Gambia and empties into the Atlantic Ocean . It has an area of 10,689 square kilometres ( 4,127 sq mi ) with a population of 1,857,181 as of the April 2013 census . Banjul is the Gambian capital and the largest cities are Serekunda and Brikama . The Gambia shares historical roots with many other West African nations in the slave trade , which was the key factor in the placing and keeping of a colony on the Gambia River , first by the Portuguese , during which era it was known as A G\u00e2mbia . Later , on 25 May 1765 , The Gambia was made a part of the British Empire when the government formally assumed control , establishing the Province of Senegambia . In 1965 , The Gambia gained independence under the leadership of Dawda Jawara , who ruled until Yahya Jammeh seized power in a bloodless 1994 coup . Adama Barrow became The Gambia 's third president in January 2017 , after defeating Jammeh in the December 2016 elections . Jammeh initially accepted the results , then refused to accept them , which triggered a constitutional crisis and military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States , resulting in his exile . The Gambia 's economy is dominated by farming , fishing and , especially , tourism . In 2015 , 48.6% of the population lived in poverty .",
  "/wiki/Presidential_system": "A presidential system is a democratic and republican government in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch . This head of government is in most cases also the head of state , which is called president . In presidential countries , the executive is elected and is not responsible to the legislature , which can not in normal circumstances dismiss it . Such dismissal is possible , however , in uncommon cases , often through impeachment . The title president has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body , as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States , prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government . A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system , where the head of government is elected to power through the legislative . There is also a hybrid system called semi-presidentialism . Countries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president . Heads of state of parliamentary republics , largely ceremonial in most cases , are called presidents . Dictators or leaders of one-party states , popularly elected or not , are also often called presidents . Presidentialism is the dominant form of government in the continental Americas , with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics ( except for Canada , Belize and Suriname ) . It is also prevalent in Central and southern West Africa and in Central Asia .",

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves .

  "/wiki/Semi-presidential_system": "A semi-presidential system or dual executive system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet , with the latter being responsible to the legislature of the state . It differs from a parliamentary republic in that it has a popularly elected head of state , who is more than a mostly ceremonial figurehead , and from the presidential system in that the cabinet , although named by the president , is responsible to the legislature , which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence . While the Weimar Republic ( 1919-1933 ) exemplified an early semi-presidential system , the term semi-presidential was introduced in a 1959 article by journalist Hubert Beuve-M\u00e9ry and popularized by a 1978 work by political scientist Maurice Duverger , both of which intended to describe the French Fifth Republic ( established in 1958 ) .",

It borders Uganda to the north ; Kenya to the northeast ; Comoro Islands and the Indian Ocean to the east ; Mozambique and Malawi to the south ; Zambia to the southwest ; and Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They subsequently migrated across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago . German rule began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa .",

Consisting of the main islands Trinidad and Tobago , and numerous much smaller islands , it is situated 130 kilometres ( 81 miles ) south of Grenada and 11 kilometres ( 6.8 miles ) off the coast of northeastern Venezuela . It shares maritime boundaries with Barbados to the northeast , Grenada to the northwest , Guyana to the southeast , and Venezuela to the south and west . The island of Trinidad was inhabited for centuries by native Amerindian peoples before becoming a colony in the Spanish Empire , following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498 . Spanish governor Don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chac\u00f3n surrendered the island to a British fleet under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797 . During the same period , the island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish , British , French , Dutch and Courlander colonisers more times than any other island in the Caribbean . [ citation needed ] Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889 . Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962 , becoming a republic in 1976 . Trinidad and Tobago has the third highest GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity ( PPP ) in the Americas after the United States and Canada . It is recognised by the World Bank as a high-income economy . Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories , which rely heavily on tourism , the Trinidadian economy is primarily industrial with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals ; much of the nation 's wealth is derived from its large reserves of oil and natural gas .",
  "/wiki/Uganda": "Uganda , officially the Republic of Uganda ( Swahili : Jamhuri ya Uganda ; Luganda : Eggwanga Yuganda ) is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa . It is bordered to the east by Kenya , to the north by South Sudan , to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo , to the south-west by Rwanda , and to the south by Tanzania . The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria , shared with Kenya and Tanzania . Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region . Uganda also lies within the Nile basin , and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate . Uganda takes its name from the Buganda kingdom , which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country , including the capital Kampala . The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago , when Bantu-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country . Beginning in 1894 , the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK , who established administrative law across the territory . Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 . The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts , including an 8-year-long far right military dictatorship led by Idi Amin . Additionally , a lengthy civil war against the Lord 's Resistance Army in the Northern Region led by Joseph Kony , has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties . The official languages are English and Swahili , although any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative , administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law ."
