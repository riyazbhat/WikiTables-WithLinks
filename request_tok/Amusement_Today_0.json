It belongs to the family Bovidae , which includes antelopes , cattle , goats , sheep , and other even-toed horned ungulates . Connochaetes includes two species , both native to Africa : the black wildebeest or white-tailed gnu ( C. gnou ) , and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu ( C. taurinus ) . Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago , resulting in a northern and a southern species . The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species , while the black wildebeest changed more as adaptation to its open grassland habitat in the south . The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are oriented . In East Africa , the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big-game species ; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds , but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic . Breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd , a fact necessary for their survival . Nevertheless , some fall prey to large carnivores , especially the spotted hyena . Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra , which gives heightened awareness of potential predators . They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons . Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle",
