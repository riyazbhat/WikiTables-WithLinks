  "/wiki/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_S.E.5": "The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 was a British biplane fighter aircraft of the First World War . It was developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory by a team consisting of Henry Folland , John Kenworthy and Major Frank Goodden . It was one of the fastest aircraft of the war , while being both stable and relatively manoeuvrable . According to aviation author Robert Jackson , the S.E.5 was : the nimble fighter that has since been described as the 'Spitfire of World War One ' . In most respects the S.E.5 had superior performance to the rival Sopwith Camel , although it was less immediately responsive to the controls . Problems with its Hispano-Suiza engine , particularly the geared-output H-S 8B-powered early versions , meant that there was a chronic shortage of the type until well into 1918 . Thus , while the first examples had reached the Western Front before the Camel , there were fewer squadrons equipped with the S.E.5 than with the Sopwith fighter . Together with the Camel , the S.E.5 was instrumental in regaining allied air superiority in mid-1917 and maintaining it for the rest of the war , ensuring there was no repetition of Bloody April 1917 when losses in the Royal Flying Corps were much heavier than in the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte . The S.E.5s remained in RAF service for some time following the Armistice that ended the conflict ; some were transferred to various overseas military operators , while a number were also adopted by civilian operators .",
  "/wiki/Pfalz_D.III": "The Pfalz D.III was a fighter aircraft used by the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte ( Imperial German Air Service ) during the First World War . The D.III was the first major original design from Pfalz Flugzeugwerke . Though generally considered inferior to contemporary Albatros and Fokker fighters , the D.III was widely used by the Jagdstaffeln from late 1917 to mid-1918 . It continued to serve as a training aircraft until the end of the war .",

  "/wiki/Fokker_D.VII": "The Fokker D.VII was a German World War I fighter aircraft designed by Reinhold Platz of the Fokker-Flugzeugwerke . Germany produced around 3,300 D.VII aircraft in the second half of 1918 . In service with the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte , the D.VII quickly proved itself to be a formidable aircraft . The Armistice ending the war specifically required , as the fourth clause of the Clauses Relating to the Western Front , that Germany was required to surrender all D.VIIs to the Allies . Surviving aircraft saw much service with many countries in the years after World War I .",
  "/wiki/Rumpler_C.IV": "The Rumpler C.IV was a German single-engine , two-seat reconnaissance biplane . The C.IV was a development of C.III with different tail surfaces and using a Mercedes D.IVa engine in place of C.III 's Benz Bz.IV . In addition to the parent company , the aircraft was also built by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke as the Pfalz C.I . Another variant of the basic design was the Rumpler 6B 2 single-seat floatplane fighter , with a 120 kW ( 160 hp ) Mercedes D.III engine , built for the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . For a two-seater reconnaissance aircraft , Rumpler C.IV had an excellent performance , which enabled it to remain in front-line service until the end of World War I on the Western Front , as well as in Italy and Palestine . Its exceptional ceiling allowed pilots to undertake reconnaissance secure in the knowledge that few allied aircraft could reach it . 300 aircraft were licence-built by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke as the Pfalz C.I , differing in ailerons on all four wings . From February 1917 they were renamed Rumpler C.IV ( Pfal ) . For use during filming , Slingsby Sailplanes built two Slingsby T.58 Rumpler C.IV replicas . While these were visually similar to the original aircraft , they were structurally completely different , having a steel-tube fuselage structure and wooden wings , and being powered by a de Havilland Gipsy Major engine .",

  "/wiki/Observation_balloon": "An observation balloon is a type of balloon that is employed as an aerial platform for intelligence gathering and artillery spotting . Use of observation balloons began during the French Revolutionary Wars , reaching their zenith during World War I , and they continue in limited use today . Historically , observation balloons were filled with hydrogen . The balloons were fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen gas , whose flammable nature led to the destruction of hundreds of balloons on both sides . Observers manning these observation balloons frequently had to use a parachute to evacuate their balloon when it came under attack . To avoid the potentially flammable consequences of hydrogen , observation balloons after World War I were often filled with non-flammable helium . Typically , balloons were tethered to a steel cable attached to a winch that reeled the gasbag to its desired height ( usually 1,000-1,500 metres ) and retrieved it at the end of an observation session .",

  "/wiki/Sopwith_Camel": "The Sopwith Camel was a British First World War single-seat biplane fighter aircraft that was introduced on the Western Front in 1917 . It was developed by the Sopwith Aviation Company as a successor to the Sopwith Pup and became one of the best known fighter aircraft of the Great War . The Camel was powered by a single rotary engine and was armed with twin synchronized Vickers machine guns . Though proving difficult to handle , it provided for a high level of manoeuvrability to an experienced pilot , an attribute which was highly valued in the type 's principal use as a fighter aircraft . In total , Camel pilots have been credited with downing 1,294 enemy aircraft , more than any other Allied fighter of the conflict . Towards the end of the First World War , the type had also seen use as a ground-attack aircraft , partially due to it having become increasingly outclassed as the capabilities of fighter aircraft on both sides were rapidly advancing at that time . The main variant of the Camel was designated as the F.1 ; several dedicated variants were built for a variety of roles , including the 2F.1 Ship 's Camel , which was used for operating from the flight decks of aircraft carriers , the Comic night fighter variant , and the T.F.1 , a dedicated trench fighter that had been armoured for the purpose of conducting ground attacks upon heavily defended enemy lines . The Camel also saw use as a two-seat trainer aircraft . In January 1920 , the last aircraft of the type were withdrawn from RAF service .",

A sub-prefecture of the department , Cambrai is a town which had 32,518 inhabitants in the Census of 2009 . It is in the heart of the urban unit of Cambrai [ fr ] which , with 47,138 inhabitants , ranks as 7th largest of the department . Its urban area [ fr ] , a more extensive range , included 65,986 inhabitants in 2009 . With Lille and the towns of the former Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin , it is also part of the Metropolitan area of Lille [ fr ] which has more than 3.8 million inhabitants . Towards the end of the Roman Empire , Cambrai replaced Bavay as the capital of the land of the Nervii . At the beginning of the Merovingian era , Cambrai became the seat of an immense archdiocese covering all the right bank of the Scheldt and the centre of a small ecclesiastical principality , roughly coinciding with the shire of Brabant , including the central part of the Low Countries . The bishopric had some limited secular power and depended on the Holy Roman Empire until annexation to France in 1678 . F\u00e9nelon , nicknamed the Swan of Cambrai , was the most renowned of the archbishops . The fertile lands which surround it and the textile industry gave it prosperity in the Middle Ages , but in modern times it is less industrialised than its neighbours of Nord-Pas-de-Calais . Cambrai was the Duke of Wellington 's headquarters , for the British Army of Occupation , from 1815 to 1818 . Occupied and partly destroyed by the German army during World War I , Cambrai saw unfold in its vicinity the Battle of Cambrai ( 20 November 1917 - 3 December 1917 ) where tanks were massively and successfully used for the first time .",

  "/wiki/DFW_C.V": "The DFW C.IV , DFW C.V , DFW C.VI , and DFW F37 were a family of German reconnaissance aircraft first used in 1916 in World War I . They were conventionally configured biplanes with unequal-span unstaggered wings and seating for the pilot and observer in tandem , open cockpits . Like the DFW C.II before them , these aircraft seated the gunner to the rear and armed him with a machine gun on a ring mount . Compared to preceding B- and C-class designs by DFW , however , the aerodynamics of the fuselage were more refined , and when coupled with more powerful engines , resulted in a machine with excellent performance .",
  "/wiki/Halberstadt_C.V": "The Halberstadt C.V was a German single-engined reconnaissance biplane of World War I , built by Halberst\u00e4dter Flugzeugwerke . Derived from the Halberstadt C.III , with a more powerful supercharged 160 kW ( 220 hp ) Benz Bz.IV\u00fc engine , it saw service only in the final months of the war . Cameras were mounted in the observer 's cockpit floor . The aircraft had very good flight characteristics , especially manoeuvrability and rate of climb , and was among best German World War I aircraft in its class . First aircraft appeared in front in late June 1918 ."
