  "/wiki/Graphical_user_interface": "The graphical user interface ( GUI /\u02c8\u0261u\u02d0a\u026a/ gee-you-eye [ Note 1 ] ) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation , instead of text-based user interfaces , typed command labels or text navigation . GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces ( CLIs ) , which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard . The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements . Beyond computers , GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players , portable media players , gaming devices , smartphones and smaller household , office and industrial controls . The term GUI tends not to be applied to other lower-display resolution types of interfaces , such as video games ( where head-up display ( HUD ) is preferred ) , or not including flat screens , like volumetric displays because the term is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens able to describe generic information , in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center .",
  "/wiki/Integrated_development_environment": "An integrated development environment ( IDE ) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development . An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor , build automation tools and a debugger . Some IDEs , such as NetBeans and Eclipse , contain the necessary compiler , interpreter , or both ; others , such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus , do not . The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined ; sometimes a version control system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface ( GUI ) are integrated . Many modern IDEs also have a class browser , an object browser , and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented software development .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",

It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/BeOS": "BeOS is an operating system for personal computers first developed by Be Inc. in 1991 . It was first written to run on BeBox hardware . BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth , pervasive multithreading , preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS . The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean , uncluttered design . The API was written in C++ for ease of programming . It has partial POSIX compatibility and access to a command-line interface through Bash , although internally it is not a Unix-derived operating system . BeOS used Unicode as the default encoding in the GUI , though support for input methods such as bidirectional text input was never realized . BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform that could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to Classic Mac OS and Microsoft Windows . It was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share , however , and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc . The company was acquired by Palm Inc. and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts . The open-source OS Haiku , a complete reimplementation of BeOS , is designed to start up where BeOS left off . Beta 1 of Haiku was released in September 2018 , six years after Alpha 4 .",

Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s , and work on its direct descendant , GNU Emacs , continues actively as of 2020 [ update ] . Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its user interface allows the user to combine these commands into macros to automate work . Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the Lisp programming language that provides a deep extension capability , allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor . Extensions have been written to manage email , files , outlines , and RSS feeds , as well as clones of ELIZA , Pong , Conway 's Life , Snake and Tetris . The original EMACS was written in 1976 by Carl Mikkelsen , David A . Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of Editor MACroS for the TECO editor . It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS . The most popular , and most ported , version of Emacs is GNU Emacs , which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project . XEmacs is a variant that branched from GNU Emacs in 1991 .

  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",

  "/wiki/Adobe_PS": "Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS . It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll . Since then , the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing , but in digital art as a whole . The software 's name has thus become a generic trademark , leading to its usage as a verb ( e.g . to photoshop an image , photoshopping , and photoshop contest ) although Adobe discourages such use . Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks , alpha compositing and several color models including RGB , CMYK , CIELAB , spot color , and duotone . Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features . In addition to raster graphics , this software has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics ( especially through clipping path for the latter ) , as well as 3D graphics and video . Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins ; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features . Photoshop 's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers . However , in October 2002 ( following the introduction of Creative Suite branding ) , each new version of Photoshop was designated with CS plus a number ; e.g. , the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2 . Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions : Standard and Extended .",
