Thirty-five of the class were built to haul express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line route from London Kings Cross via York to Newcastle , and later via Newcastle to Edinburgh , Scotland . They remained in service on the East Coast Main Line until the early 1960s when they were replaced by Deltic diesel locomotives .

It is historically significant as the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives at 126 mph ( 203 km/h ) . The A4 class was designed by Nigel Gresley to power high-speed streamlined trains . The wind-tunnel-tested , aerodynamic body and high power allowed the class to reach speeds of over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km/h ) , although in everyday service it rarely attained this speed . While in British Railways days regular steam-hauled rail services in the UK were officially limited to a 90 mph 'line speed ' , pre-war , the A4s had to run significantly above 90 mph just to keep schedule on trains such as the Silver Jubilee and The Coronation , with the engines reaching 100 mph on many occasions . Mallard covered almost one and a half million miles ( 2.4 million km ) before it was retired in 1963 . The locomotive is 70 ft ( 21 m ) long and weighs 165 tons , including the tender . It is painted LNER garter blue with red wheels and steel rims . Mallard is now part of the National Collection at the United Kingdom 's National Railway Museum in York .",

This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae . The male birds ( drakes ) have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly , while the females ( hens or ducks ) have mainly brown-speckled plumage . Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings ; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers . The mallard is 50-65 cm ( 20-26 in ) long , of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length . The wingspan is 81-98 cm ( 32-39 in ) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm ( 1.7 to 2.4 in ) long . It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks , weighing 0.72-1.58 kg ( 1.6-3.5 lb ) . Mallards live in wetlands , eat water plants and small animals , and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes . This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks . The female lays eight to 13 creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs , on alternate days . Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days . The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch .",

Historically part of Lanarkshire , the city now forms the Glasgow City council area , one of the 32 council areas of Scotland ; the local authority is Glasgow City Council . Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",

  "/wiki/Lord_of_the_Isles": "The Lord of the Isles ( Scottish Gaelic : Triath nan Eilean or R\u00ecgh Innse Gall ) is a title of Scottish nobility with historical roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland . It emerged from a series of hybrid Viking/Gaelic rulers of the west coast and islands of Scotland in the Middle Ages , who wielded sea-power with fleets of galleys ( birlinns ) . Although they were , at times , nominal vassals of the Kings of Norway , Ireland , or Scotland , the island chiefs remained functionally independent for many centuries . Their territory included the Hebrides ( Skye and Ross from 1438 ) , Knoydart , Ardnamurchan , and the Kintyre peninsula . At their height they were the greatest landowners and most powerful lords in Britain after the Kings of England and Scotland . The end of the MacDonald Lords came in 1493 when MacDonald II had his ancestral homeland , estates , and titles seized by King James IV of Scotland . Since that time , the MacDonald Clan has contested the right of James IV to the Lordship of the Isles and uprisings and rebellions against the Scottish Monarch were common . More recently , the Lordship of the Isles has been held by the Duke of Rothesay , the eldest son and heir apparent of the King of Scotland , a title which , since the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain , is borne by the Prince of Wales . Thus Prince Charles is the current Lord of the Isles . Finlaggan on Islay was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald ."
