In the past the term insect was vaguer , and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla , such as arachnids , myriapods , earthworms , land snails , and slugs . This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use . Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology , entomology is a taxon-based category ; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is , by definition , entomology . Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics , behavior , biomechanics , biochemistry , systematics , physiology , developmental biology , ecology , morphology , and paleontology . At some 1.3 million described species , insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms , date back some 400 million years , and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth .",
