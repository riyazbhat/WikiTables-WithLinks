Sometimes , a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks , coordinates the production , manufacture , distribution , marketing , promotion , and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos , while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ( artists and repertoire or A & R ) , and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers .

Actor Michael Ironside reprised his role as Fisher , while Don Jordan returned from the original game to voice Third Echelon director Irving Lambert and Claudia Besso returned as hacker and analyst Anna Gr\u00edmsd\u00f3ttir having both been replaced by Dennis Haysbert and Adriana Anderson respectively in Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow .
