An ecologically diverse people , they occupy 11 different ecological zones of the Western Congo Basin . They are related to the Baka people of Cameroon , Gabon , northern Congo , and southwestern Central African Republic . Unlike the Mbuti pygmies of the eastern Congo ( who speak only the language of the tribes with whom they are affiliated ) , the Aka speak their own language along with whichever of the approximately 15 Bantu peoples they are affiliated .

  "/wiki/Aka_language": "Aka , also known as Yaka or Beka , is a Bantu language spoken in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo , along the Ubangi River dividing the two countries . Aka is spoken by the Aka people , pygmies closely related to the Ubangian-speaking Baka of Cameroon , Congo and Gabon . Together , these peoples are known as the Mbenga ( Bambenga ) or Binga ( Babinga ) , the latter derogatory . Famously , Aka shares vocabulary with the Baka languages , mostly concerning a specialised forest economy , such as words for edible plants , medicinal plants and honey collecting . This is among the 30% of Aka which is not Bantu and the 30% of Baka which is not Ubangian and has been posited as the remnant of an ancestral Western Pygmy ( Mbenga or Baaka ) language which has otherwise vanished . However , it is entirely possible that the Aka shifted to Bantu from a Ubangian language related to Baka , in which case the situation reduces to a single ethnic group adapted to the forest with correspondingly specialised vocabulary . There is no evidence for a wider linguistic affiliation with any of the other Pygmy peoples . The Aka people call themselves Mraka in the singular and Beka in the plural . The people and their language go by various alternate spellings : M\u00f2-\u00c1ka , Moyaka , Bayaka , Yaga , Bayaga , Gbayaka , Biaka , Bek\u00e1 , Yakwa , Yakpa , Yakpwa , Nyoyaka . The western Aka are known as the Benzele ( Mbenz\u00e9l\u00e9 , Babenz\u00e9l\u00e9 , Bambenzele , Ba-Benjelle ) , and the eastern Aka as the Sese ( Basese ) .

Two thirds of the country is within the Ubangi River basin ( which flows into the Congo ) , while the remaining third lies in the basin of the Chari , which flows into Lake Chad . What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia ; however , the country 's current borders were established by France , which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century . After gaining independence from France in 1960 , the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders , including an abortive attempt at a monarchy ; by the 1990s , calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993 .

It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",
