Named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz , queen consort of King George III of the United Kingdom , Charlottetown was originally an unincorporated town that incorporated as a city in 1855 . It was famously the site of the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 , the first gathering of Canadian and Maritime statesmen to debate the proposed Maritime Union and the more persuasive British North American Union , now known as Canadian Confederation . From this , the city adopted as its motto Cunabula Foederis - Birthplace of Confederation .

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Canada": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",

He later studied art in Boston , London 's Slade School of Art , in Paris under L\u00e9on Bonnat , and in Rome . He traveled extensively , finally settling in Montreal . His commission to paint the Fathers of Confederation came early in his career ( 1883 ) and it established his reputation as a portrait artist . He was later commissioned by news publications of the day to create portraits of notable personalities , ranging from politicians to scoundrels . For example , he made portraits of those accused of murdering the Donnelley 's for the Toronto Globe . He was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts ( RCA ) and elected president of the RCA in 1893 . An important collection of his works is housed at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown . His painting , A Meeting of the School Trustees illustrating a confrontation between PEI teacher Kate Henderson and her school 's trustees appeared on a Canadian stamp in 1980 and was dramatised by a Heritage Minute .

The modern pharmacist ( also colloquially referred to as a chemist in British English ) has taken over this role . In some languages and regions , the word apothecary is still used to refer to a retail pharmacy or a pharmacist who owns one . Apothecaries ' investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients was a precursor to the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology . In addition to dispensing herbs and medicine , the apothecary offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed by other specialist practitioners , such as surgeons and obstetricians . Apothecary shops sold ingredients and the medicines they prepared wholesale to other medical practitioners , as well as dispensing them to patients .

  "/wiki/Pharmacy": "Pharmacy is the science and technique of preparing , dispensing , and reviewing drugs and providing additional clinical services . It is a health profession that links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and aims to ensure the safe , effective , and affordable use of drugs . The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries . Based on the setting , the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy . Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy . The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications , and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services , reviewing medications for safety and efficacy , and providing drug information . Pharmacists , therefore , are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients . An establishment in which pharmacy ( in the first sense ) is practiced is called a pharmacy ( this term is more common in the United States ) or a chemist 's ( which is more common in Great Britain ) . In the United States and Canada , drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries . In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients , the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology , prior to the formulation of the scientific method .",

The editor of Prince Edward Island 's main Tory newspaper , The Islander , from 1859 to 1872 , he entered politics in 1863 . He was named Colonial Secretary in 1859 even though he was not a part of the legislature because of a government experiment of having civil servants head the government departments . When he became a representative for the constituency of Belfast in 1863 , he continued to hold that position . He was one of the hosts of the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 . An enthusiastic supporter of Canadian Confederation , he left the PEI cabinet in 1864 when the government rejected Confederation outright , but continued to press for union . The allocation of land was a key issue for Islanders in the 1860s ; Pope opposed the idea of escheat , a common idea at the time .

  "/wiki/Charlottetown_Conference": "The Charlottetown Conference was held in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island for representatives from the colonies of British North America to discuss Canadian Confederation . The conference took place between September 1 through 9 , 1864 . The conference had been planned as a meeting of representatives from the Maritime colonies ; Nova Scotia , New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island . Newfoundland agreed with the movement , but was not notified in time to take part in the proceedings . Britain encouraged a Maritime Union between these colonies , hoping that they would then become less economically and politically dependent on the Crown , and provide for greater economic and military power for the region in light of the American Civil War . However , another colony , the Province of Canada , comprising present-day Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec , heard news of the planned conference and asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them . In August 1864 Newfoundland also asked to be allowed to join the conference . Coincidentally there was a circus in Charlottetown during the conference , and it was much more interesting to the majority of the population . At the very least , the circus made making accommodations for all the delegates difficult , since there had not been a circus in Prince Edward Island in over 20 years . There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria , so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself , including rowing out to greet the new arrivals . Owing to the unexpectedly large number of visitors in the city , a sizable proportion of the Canadian delegates remained aboard the Queen Victoria while others found accommodations at the Franklin .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

It usually houses the city or town council , its associated departments , and their employees . It also usually functions as the base of the mayor of a city , town , borough , county or shire . By convention , until the middle of the 19th century , a single large open chamber ( or hall ) formed an integral part of the building housing the council . The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events . This large chamber , the town hall ( and its later variant city hall ) has become synonymous with the whole building , and with the administrative body housed in it . The terms council chambers , municipal building or variants may be used locally in preference to town hall if no such large hall is present within the building . The local government may endeavor to use the building to promote and enhance the quality of life of the community . In many cases , town halls serve not only as buildings for government functions , but also have facilities for various civic and cultural activities . These may include art shows , stage performances , exhibits and festivals . Modern town halls or civic centres are often designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind .

Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty ; made in the Summer of the Year 1770 , a practical book which instructed Englands leisured travellers to examine the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty . Picturesque , along with the aesthetic and cultural strands of Gothic and Celticism , was a part of the emerging Romantic sensibility of the 18th century . The term picturesque needs to be understood in relationship to two other aesthetic ideals : the beautiful and the sublime . By the last third of the 18th century , Enlightenment and rationalist ideas about aesthetics were being challenged by looking at the experiences of beauty and sublimity as non-rational . Aesthetic experience was not just a rational decision - one did not look at a pleasing curved form and decide it was beautiful ; rather it came naturally as a matter of basic human instinct . Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire , while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation . Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime , showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealized states . As Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands : The mountains are ecstatic [ \u2026 ] . None but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror .

[ a ] The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada 's Maritime provinces ( Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and Prince Edward Island ) , as well as part of Quebec , and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River . Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France . It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada ( modern-day Quebec ) . As a result , the Acadians and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois developed two distinct histories and cultures . The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France , but especially northern and central regions such as \u00cele-de-France , Normandy , Brittany , Poitou and Aquitaine . During the French and Indian War ( the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War ) , British colonial officers suspected that Acadians were aligned with France , after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beaus\u00e9jour . Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War , the British , together with New England legislators and militia , carried out the Great Expulsion ( Le Grand D\u00e9rangement ) of the Acadians during the 1755-1764 period . They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region . Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning .

  "/wiki/Thomas_Fuller_(architect)": "Thomas Fuller ( March 8 , 1823 - September 28 , 1898 ) was a Canadian architect . From 1881 to 1896 , he was Chief Dominion Architect for the Government of Canada , during which time he played a role in the design and construction of every major federal building . Fuller was born in Bath , Somerset ( England ) , where he trained as an architect . Living in Bath and London he did a number of projects . In 1845 he left for Antigua , where he spent two years working on a new cathedral before emigrating to Canada in 1857 . Settling in Toronto , he formed a partnership with Chilion Jones with Fuller responsible for design work . The company first won the contract to design the church of St. Stephen-in-the-Fields . In 1859 , The Legislative Assembly in Ottawa voted the sum of \u00a375,000 for the erection of a Parliament House and offered a premium of $ 1000 for the best design within that budget . The winning bid was made by Fuller and Jones for a neo-gothic design . The principal architects until its completion in 1866 were Thomas Fuller and Charles Baillairge . In Hand Book to the Parliamentary and Departmental Buildings , Canada ( 1867 ) , Joseph Bureau wrote , The corner stone was laid with great ceremony by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in September , 1860 , on which occasion the rejoicings partook of the nature of the place , the lumber arches and men being a novelty to most of its visitors , bullocks and sheep were roasted whole upon the government ground and all comers were feasted .

  "/wiki/New_England": "New England is a region composed of six states in the northeastern United States : Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut . It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and by the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick to the northeast and Quebec to the north . The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast , and Long Island Sound is to the southwest . Boston is New England 's largest city , as well as the capital of Massachusetts . Greater Boston is the largest metropolitan area , with nearly a third of New England 's population ; this area includes Worcester , Massachusetts ( the second-largest city in New England ) , Manchester , New Hampshire ( the largest city in New Hampshire ) , and Providence , Rhode Island ( the capital and largest city of Rhode Island ) . In 1620 , Puritan Separatist Pilgrims from England established Plymouth Colony , the second successful English settlement in America , following the Jamestown Settlement in Virginia founded in 1607 . Ten years later , more Puritans established Massachusetts Bay Colony north of Plymouth Colony . Over the next 126 years , people in the region fought in four French and Indian Wars , until the English colonists and their Iroquois allies defeated the French and their Algonquian allies in America . In 1692 , the town of Salem , Massachusetts and surrounding areas experienced the Salem witch trials , one of the most infamous cases of mass hysteria in history . In the late 18th century , political leaders from the New England colonies initiated resistance to Britain 's taxes without the consent of the colonists . Residents of Rhode Island captured and burned a British ship which was enforcing unpopular trade restrictions , and residents of Boston threw British tea into the harbor . Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government which the colonists called the Intolerable Acts .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Louisbourg_(1745)": "The Siege of Louisbourg took place in 1745 when a New England colonial force aided by a British fleet captured Louisbourg , the capital of the French province of \u00cele-Royale ( present-day Cape Breton Island ) during the War of the Austrian Succession , known as King George 's War in the British colonies . The northern British colonies regarded Louisbourg as a menace , calling it the American Dunkirk due to its use as a base for privateers . There was regular , intermittent warfare between the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy on one side and the northern New England colonies on the other ( See the Northeast Coast Campaigns of 1688 , 1703 , 1723 , 1724 ) . For the French , the Fortress of Louisbourg also protected the chief entrance to Canada , as well as the nearby French fisheries . The French government had spent 25 years in fortifying it , and the cost of its defenses was reckoned at thirty million livres . Although the fortress 's construction and layout was acknowledged as having superior seaward defences , a series of low rises behind them made it vulnerable to a land attack . The low rises provided attackers places to erect siege batteries . The fort 's garrison was poorly paid and supplied , and its inexperienced leaders mistrusted them . The colonial attackers were also lacking in experience , but ultimately succeeded in gaining control of the surrounding defences . The defenders surrendered in the face of an imminent assault . Louisbourg was an important bargaining chip in the peace negotiations to end the war , since it represented a major British success . Factions within the British government were opposed to returning it to the French as part of any peace agreement , but these were eventually overruled , and Louisbourg was returned , over the objections of the victorious British North Americans , to French control after the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle , in return for French concessions elsewhere .",
  "/wiki/New_France": "New France ( French : Nouvelle-France ) , also sometimes known as the French North American Empire or Royal New France , was the area colonized by France in America , beginning with the exploration of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The territory of New France consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712 , each with its own administration : Canada , the most developed colony and divided into the districts of Qu\u00e9bec , Trois-Rivi\u00e8res , and Montr\u00e9al ; Hudson 's Bay ; Acadie in the northeast ; Plaisance on the island of Newfoundland ; and Louisiane . It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico , including all the Great Lakes of North America . In the sixteenth century , the lands were used primarily to draw from the wealth of natural resources such as furs through trade with the various indigenous peoples . In the seventeenth century , successful settlements began in Acadia and in Quebec . By 1765 , the population of the new Province of Quebec reached approximately 70,000 settlers . The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in France giving Great Britain its claims over mainland Acadia , the Hudson Bay , and Newfoundland . France established the colony of \u00cele Royale , now called Cape Breton Island , where they built the Fortress of Louisbourg . The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764 , which has been remembered on July 28 each year since 2003 . Their descendants are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and in Maine and Louisiana , with small populations in Ch\u00e9ticamp , Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands . Some also went to France . In 1763 , France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain , except the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , at the Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years ' War , part of which included the French and Indian War in America .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

In relation to churches , writers on architecture use the term basilica to describe a church built in a particular style . The early Christian purpose-built cathedral basilica of the bishop was in this style , constructed on the model of the semi-public secular basilicas , and its growth in size and importance signalled the gradual transfer of civic power into episcopal hands , which was under way in the 5th century . In the 18th century , the term took on a canonical sense , unrelated to this architectural style . Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major ( greater ) and minor basilicas .
