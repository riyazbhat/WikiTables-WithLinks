  "/wiki/Frederick_Ingersoll": "Frederick Ingersoll ( 1876 - October 23 , 1927 ) was an American inventor , designer , builder and entrepreneur who created the world 's first chain of amusement parks ( known collectively as Luna Parks regardless of their actual name ) and whose manufacturing company built 277 roller coasters , fueling the popularity of trolley parks in the first third of the twentieth century . Some of these parks and roller coasters are still existing today .",
  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design .",
