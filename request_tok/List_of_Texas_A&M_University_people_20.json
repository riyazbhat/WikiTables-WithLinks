  "/wiki/Texas_Railroad_Commission": "The Railroad Commission of Texas ( RRC ; also sometimes called the Texas Railroad Commission , TRC ) is the state agency that regulates the oil and gas industry , gas utilities , pipeline safety , safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry , and surface coal and uranium mining . Despite its name , it ceased regulating railroads in 2005 . Established by the Texas Legislature in 1891 , it is the state 's oldest regulatory agency and began as part of the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era . From the 1930s to the 1960s it largely set world oil prices , but was displaced by OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) after 1973 . In 1984 , the federal government took over transportation regulation for railroads , trucking and buses , but the Railroad Commission kept its name . With an annual budget of $ 79 million , it now focuses entirely on oil , gas , mining , propane , and pipelines , setting allocations for production each month . The three-member commission was initially appointed by the governor , but an amendment to the state 's constitution in 1894 established the commissioners as elected officials who serve overlapping six-year terms , like the sequence in the U.S. Senate , elected statewide . No specific seat is designated as chairman ; the commissioners choose the chairman from among themselves . Normally the commissioner who faces reelection is the chairman for the preceding two years . The current commissioners are Christi Craddick since December 17 , 2012 , Ryan Sitton since January 5 , 2015 , and Wayne Christian since January 9 , 2017"
