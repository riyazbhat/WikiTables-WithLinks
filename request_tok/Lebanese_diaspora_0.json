At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3 % of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves",

The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East ( as opposed to the Far East ) beginning in the early 20th century . The broader concept of the Greater Middle East ( or Middle East and North Africa ) also adds the Maghreb , Sudan , Djibouti , Somalia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and sometimes even Central Asia and Transcaucasia into the region . The term Middle East has led to some confusion over its changing definitions . Most Middle Eastern countries ( 13 out of 18 ) are part of the Arab world . The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times , with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia . Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East , including Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Arabs constitute the majority ethnic group in the region , followed by Turks , Persians , Kurds , Azeris , Copts , Jews , Assyrians , Iraqi Turkmen , and Greek Cypriots . The Middle East generally has a hot , arid climate , with several major rivers providing irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas such as the Nile Delta in Egypt , the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia ( Iraq , Kuwait , and eastern Syria ) , and most of what is known as the Fertile Crescent . The most populous countries in the region are Egypt , Iran , and Turkey , while Saudi Arabia is the largest Middle Eastern country by area .

Until 1922 , Levantine immigrants were considered Turks , as they carried passports issued by the Turkish Ottoman Empire , which then ruled over present-day Lebanon . The population of Brazil of either full or partial Lebanese descent is estimated by the Brazilian and Lebanese governments to be around 7 million people . According to a research conducted by IBGE in 2008 , covering only the states of Amazonas , Para\u00edba , S\u00e3o Paulo , Rio Grande do Sul , Mato Grosso , and Distrito Federal , 0.9 % of white Brazilian respondents said they had family origins in the Middle East . If the first figure is correct ( 7 million ) , this number of descendants is larger than the population in Lebanon . However , other Middle Eastern countries such as Syria , Iraq , Jordan , and Palestine also contributed immigrants to Brazil , and nowadays , most of their descendants are of only partial Middle Eastern ancestry . Immigration of the Lebanese ( and Syrians ) to Brazil started in the late 19th century , most of them coming from Lebanon and later from Syria . The immigration to Brazil grew further in the 20th century , and was concentrated in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo , but also extended to Minas Gerais , Goi\u00e1s , Rio de Janeiro , and other parts of Brazil . Between 1884 and 1933 , 130,000 Lebanese people immigrated to Brazil - 65 % of them were Catholics ( Maronite Catholics and Melkite Catholics ) , 20 % were Eastern Orthodox , and 15 % were Muslims ( Shia , Sunni , and Druze ) . According to French Consulate reports from that time , Lebanese/ Syrian immigrants in S\u00e3o Paulo and Santos were 130,000 , in Par\u00e1 20,000 , Rio de Janeiro 15,000 , Rio Grande do Sul 14,000 , and in Bahia 12,000 .

Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 .

Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona .

Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 .

Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north , Kuwait to the northeast , Qatar , Bahrain , and the United Arab Emirates to the east , Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south ; it is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba . It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast , and most of its terrain consists of arid desert , lowland and mountains . As of October 2018 , the Saudi economy was the largest in the Middle East and the 18th largest in the world . Saudi Arabia also has one of the world 's youngest populations ; 50 percent of its 33.4 million people are under 25 years old . The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations . The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world . The world 's second-largest religion , Islam , emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia . In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe",
