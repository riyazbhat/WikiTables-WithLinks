  "/wiki/National_Hockey_League": "The National Hockey League ( NHL ; French : Ligue nationale de hockey - LNH ) is a professional ice hockey league in North America , currently comprising 31 teams : 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada . The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada . The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario . The NHL immediately took the NHA 's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926 . At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion . The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979 . Between 1991 and 2000 , the NHL further expanded to 30 teams . It added its 31st team in 2017 and has approved the addition of a 32nd team in 2021 .",

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation , he had a political career which spanned almost half a century . Macdonald was born in Scotland ; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada ( today in eastern Ontario ) . As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston , which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada . By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 . Macdonald 's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion , using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party , promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy , and completing the railway . He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada": "The Prime Minister of Canada is an official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown , chair of the Cabinet , and thus head of government of Canada . Officially , the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada , but by constitutional convention , the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons . Normally , this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house . But if that leader lacks the support of the majority , the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election . By constitutional convention , a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and , since the early 20th century , this has more specifically meant the House of Commons . The office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the Constitution of Canada ; executive authority is formally vested in the sovereign and exercised on his or her behalf by the governor general . The prime ministership is part of Canada 's constitutional convention tradition . The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time . Sir John A. Macdonald was commissioned by the Viscount Monck on 24 May 1867 , to form the first government of the Canadian Confederation . On 1 July 1867 , the first ministry assumed office . The date for which a prime minister begins his or her term has been determined by the date that he or she is sworn into his or her portfolio , as an oath of office as prime minister is not required . However , since 1957 , the incoming prime minister has sworn an oath as prime minister .",

From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",

  "/wiki/Insulin": "Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of carbohydrates , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . Beta cells are sensitive to blood sugar levels so that they secrete insulin into the blood in response to high level of glucose ; and inhibit secretion of insulin when glucose levels are low . Insulin enhances glucose uptake and metabolism in the cells , thereby reducing blood sugar level . Their neighboring alpha cells , by taking their cues from the beta cells , secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner : increased secretion when blood glucose is low , and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high . Glucagon increases blood glucose level by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver . The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of glucose homeostasis .",
  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award .",

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada . From the late 1960s until the early 1980s , Trudeau 's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life . After his appointment as Prime Minister , he won the 1968 , 1972 and 1974 elections , before narrowly losing in 1979 . He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Critics accused him of arrogance , of economic mismanagement , and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies .",

The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water . The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans . French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738 . A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812 , the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873 .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

  "/wiki/Medicare_(Canada)": "Medicare ( French : assurance-maladie ) is an unofficial designation used to refer to the publicly funded , single-payer health care system of Canada . Canada does not have a unified national health care system ; instead , the system consists of 13 provincial and territorial health insurance plans that provide universal health care coverage to Canadian citizens , permanent residents , and certain temporary residents . These systems are individually administered on a provincial or territorial basis , within guidelines set by the federal government . The formal terminology for the insurance system is provided by the Canada Health Act and the health insurance legislation of the individual provinces and territories . The name is a contraction of medical and care , and was used in the United States for health care programs since at least 1953 . Under the terms of the Canada Health Act , all insured persons are entitled to receive insured services without copayment . Such services are defined as medically necessary services if provided in hospital , or by 'practitioners ' ( usually physicians ) . Approximately 70 percent of expenditures for health care in Canada come from public sources , with the rest paid privately ( both through private insurance , and through out-of-pocket payments ) . The extent of public financing varies considerably across services . For example , approximately 99 percent of physician services , and 90 percent of hospital care , are paid by publicly funded sources , whereas almost all dental care is paid for privately . Most physicians are self-employed private entities which enjoy coverage under each province 's respective healthcare plans . Services of non-physicians working within hospitals are covered ; conversely , provinces can , but are not forced to , cover services by non-physicians if provided outside hospitals .",

The premier chooses a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Saskatchewan , and presides over that body . Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections . General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election , but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the legislative assembly . An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature , by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion . Prior to 1905 , Saskatchewan was part of the North-West Territories and was governed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories from 1870 until 1897 , and the Premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905 .",
