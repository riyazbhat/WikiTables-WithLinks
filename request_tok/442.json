  "/wiki/Temple_University": "Temple University ( Temple or TU ) is a public research university in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . It was founded in 1884 by the Baptist minister Russell Conwell . In 1882 , Conwell came to Pennsylvania to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working-class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules . These students - later dubbed night owls - were taught in the basement of Conwell 's Baptist Temple , hence the origin of the university 's name and mascot . By 1907 , the institution revised its institutional status and was incorporated as a university . As of 2019 , about 40,000 undergraduate , graduate and professional students were enrolled in more than 600 academic degree programs offered at sites across the globe , including eight campuses across Pennsylvania , Rome and Japan . Temple is among the world 's largest providers of professional education ( law , medicine , podiatry , pharmacy , dentistry , and architecture ) , preparing the largest body of professional practitioners in Pennsylvania .

In 1985 , William D. Mullins , a state representative from Ludlow , suggested that the university needed a multipurpose arena and convocation center to help expand the athletic program and assist in the university 's growth . He died in 1986 , but the state went ahead with the building of the complex , naming it for him . It replaced the Curry Hicks Cage , the 1930s-era basketball gymnasium , as home of the Minutemen basketball teams . In addition , it allowed the hockey team , which had been downgraded to club status since the late 1970s , to be elevated to Division I status .",
