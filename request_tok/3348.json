  "/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)": "The Liberal Democrats ( Lib Dems ) are a liberal political party in the United Kingdom . The party currently has 11 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons , 94 members of the House of Lords , five Members of the Scottish Parliament and one member in each of the Welsh Assembly and the London Assembly . It was in a coalition government with the Conservative Party from 2010-15 . In 1981 , an electoral alliance was established between the Liberal Party , a group which was the direct descendant of the 18th-century Whigs , and the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , a splinter group from the Labour Party . In 1988 , the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats , adopting their present name over a year later . Under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and later Charles Kennedy , the party grew during the 1990s and 2000s , focusing its campaigns on specific seats and becoming the third-largest party in the House of Commons . Under the leadership of Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrats were junior partners in David Cameron 's Conservative-led coalition government in which Clegg served as Deputy Prime Minister . Although it allowed them to implement some of their policies , the coalition damaged the Liberal Democrats ' electoral prospects and it suffered heavy losses at the 2015 general election . Since then , under the leaderships of Tim Farron , Sir Vince Cable and Jo Swinson , it has refocused itself as a party opposing Brexit . Positioned in the centre ground of British politics , the Liberal Democrats ideologically draw upon both liberalism and social democracy . Different factions have dominated the party at different points in its history , each with its own ideological bent , some leaning towards the centre-left and others the centre-right . The party calls for constitutional reform , including a transition from the first-past-the-post voting system to proportional representation .",
