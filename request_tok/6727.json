Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 . With ancient mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers , and the U.S . Interior Highlands , all regions prone to severe weather . Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for Southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans . More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma . A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agricultural products , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology .

  "/wiki/F-16_Fighting_Falcon": "The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . Designed as an air superiority day fighter , it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft . Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976 . Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force , improved versions are being built for export customers . In 1993 , General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation , which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta . The Fighting Falcon 's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility , side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering , an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot , and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft . The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment . The F-16 's official name is Fighting Falcon , but Viper is commonly used by its pilots and crews , due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service . In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force , Air Force Reserve Command , and Air National Guard units , the aircraft is also used by the USAF aerial demonstration team , the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds , and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy .

It was modified and upgraded to carry and fire two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or other munitions . The aircraft entered service in 1995 , and saw combat in the war in Afghanistan , Pakistan , the NATO intervention in Bosnia , Serbia , the Iraq War , Yemen , the 2011 Libyan civil war , the 2014 intervention in Syria , and Somalia . The USAF describes the Predator as a Tier II MALE UAS ( medium-altitude , long-endurance unmanned aircraft system ) . The UAS consists of four aircraft or air vehicles with sensors , a ground control station ( GCS ) , and a primary satellite link communication suite . Powered by a Rotax engine and driven by a propeller , the air vehicle can fly up to 400 nmi ( 460 mi ; 740 km ) to a target , loiter overhead for 14 hours , then return to its base . The RQ-1 Predator was the primary remotely piloted aircraft used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal areas from 2001 until the introduction of the MQ-9 Reaper ; it has also been deployed elsewhere . Because offensive uses of the Predator are classified by the U.S. , U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use . The United States Air Force retired the Predator in 2018 .

Unlike other modern military fixed-wing aircraft , the AC-130 relies on visual targeting . Because its large profile and low operating altitudes of approximately 7,000 feet ( 2,100 m ) make it an easy target , its close air support missions are usually flown at night . The airframe is manufactured by Lockheed Martin , while Boeing is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support . Developed during the Vietnam War as Project Gunship II , the AC-130 replaced the Douglas AC-47 Spooky , or Gunship I . The sole operator is the United States Air Force , which uses the AC-130U Spooky and AC-130W Stinger II variants for close air support , air interdiction , and force protection , with the upgraded AC-130J Ghostrider entering service . Close-air-support roles include supporting ground troops , escorting convoys , and urban operations . Air-interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity .

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the requirement for a new long-range , high-speed , vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense . In response , the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental ( JVX ) aircraft program started in 1981 . A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft . The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft . The V-22 first flew in 1989 , and began flight testing and design alterations ; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development . The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 , and fielded it in 2007 ; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights . The U.S. Air Force fielded their version of the tiltrotor , CV-22B , in 2009 . Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force , the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and Kuwait .

  "/wiki/B-1_Lancer": "The Rockwell B-1 Lancer [ N 1 ] is a supersonic variable-sweep wing , heavy bomber used by the United States Air Force . It is commonly called the Bone ( from B-One ) . It is one of three strategic bombers in the U.S. Air Force fleet as of 2020 [ update ] , the other two being the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress . The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52 , and was meant to ultimately replace both bombers . After a long series of studies , Rockwell International ( now part of Boeing ) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A . This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes . The combination of the high cost of the aircraft , the introduction of the AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic profile , and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1 . This led to the program being canceled in 1977 , after the B-1A prototypes had been built . The program was restarted in 1981 , largely as an interim measure due to delays in the B-2 stealth bomber program , with the B-2 eventually reaching initial operational capability in 1997 . This led to a redesign as the B-1B , which differed from the B-1A by having a lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25 , but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96 . The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign , and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load . The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) as a nuclear bomber in that same year .",

Development of the Minuteman began in the mid-1950s when basic research indicated that a solid fuel rocket motor could stand ready to launch for long periods of time , in contrast to liquid-fueled rockets that required fueling before launch and so might be destroyed in a surprise attack . The missile was named for the Colonial Minutemen of the American Revolutionary War , who could be ready to fight on short notice . The Minuteman entered service in 1962 as a deterrence weapon that could hit Soviet cities with a second strike and countervalue counterattack if the U.S. was attacked . However , the development of the United States Navy ( USN ) UGM-27 Polaris , which addressed the same role , allowed the Air Force to modify the Minuteman , boosting its accuracy enough to attack hardened military targets , including Soviet missile silos . The Minuteman-II entered service in 1965 with a host of upgrades to improve its accuracy and survivability in the face of an anti-ballistic missile ( ABM ) system the Soviets were known to be developing .
