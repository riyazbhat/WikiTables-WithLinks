  "/wiki/It's_Love-Love-Love": "It 's Love , Love , Love is a popular song . The music was written by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer , with lyrics by Mack David , and published in 1943 . The song was included in the film Stars on Parade ( 1944 ) . The best-known recording was by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians ( vocal by Skip Nelson ) . It was recorded on January 7 , 1944 , and released by Decca Records as catalog number 18589 . It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on April 6 , 1944 and lasted 10 weeks on the chart , peaking at # 1 . A recording later that same year was released by The King Sisters on Bluebird Records , a subsidiary of RCA Victor , and this too charted with a peak position of # 4 . Unfortunately , the ubiquitous Guy Lombardo Billboard # 1 single recording omits the charming third verse , which is arguably the most amusing in this short , humorous ditty . Sirius XM Forties Junction occasionally plays a recording ( such as the RCA Victor Four King Sisters one ) that has all three verses performed just as written , but it is rare to hear it , hard to find on YouTube , nor does iTunes offer a recording other than the Guy Lombardo 1944 version . The King Sisters did an admirable job with the song , but they did change up the chorus after the second and third verses , so it is not quite a pure rendition . However , lovers of the song may not object to what the King Sisters did , as it was well done and affected only the refrain , which is long and somewhat repetitive relative to the short verses of the song . There are a number of other problematic ( for lovers of the song as-written ) recordings out there , as well , such as the Bing Crosby recording that omits the second verse and mangles the wording on the first by gender-flipping it ( which is odd , since it is written for a man , which Crosby was , and this was long before trans-genderism came into vogue ) .",

Highly popular for most of the 1950s , Ray has been cited by critics as a major precursor to what would become rock and roll , for his jazz and blues-influenced music and his animated stage personality . Tony Bennett called Ray the father of rock and roll , and historians have noted him as a pioneering figure in the development of the genre . Raised in The Dalles , Oregon , Ray , who was partially deaf , began singing professionally at age fifteen on Portland radio stations . He would later gain a local following singing at small , predominantly African-American nightclubs in Detroit , where he was discovered in 1951 and subsequently signed to Columbia Records . He rose quickly from obscurity in the United States with the release of his debut album , Johnnie Ray ( 1952 ) , as well as with a 78 rpm single , both of whose sides reached the Billboard magazine 's Top Hot 100 songs of 1952 : Cry and The Little White Cloud That Cried . In 1954 , Ray made his first and only major motion picture , There 's No Business Like Show Business , in which he , Ethel Merman , Marilyn Monroe and others were part of an ensemble cast . His career in his native United States began to decline in 1957 , and his American record label dropped him in 1960 . He never regained a strong following there and rarely appeared on American television after 1973 . His fanbases in the United Kingdom and Australia , however , remained strong until his death in 1990 of complications from liver failure . British Hit Singles & Albums noted that Ray was a sensation in the 1950s , the heart-wrenching vocal delivery of 'Cry ' ... influenced many acts including Elvis and was the prime target for teen hysteria in the pre-Presley days . Ray 's dramatic stage performances and melancholic songs have been credited by music historians as precursory to later performers , ranging from Leonard Cohen to Morrissey .",
