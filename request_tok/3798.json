One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf . Despite its size , it remained unincorporated throughout the colonial period ; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by London , England . Election districts were organized according to Anglican parishes , and some social services were managed by Anglican wardens and vestries .",
