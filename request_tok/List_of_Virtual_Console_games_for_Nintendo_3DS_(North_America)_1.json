  "/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link's_Awakening": "The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening [ a ] is a 1993 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy . It is the fourth installment in the Legend of Zelda series and the first for a handheld game console . Link 's Awakening is one of the few Zelda games not to take place in the land of Hyrule , and does not feature Princess Zelda or the Triforce relic . Instead , protagonist Link begins the game stranded on Koholint Island , a place guarded by a whale-like deity called the Wind Fish . Assuming the role of Link , the player fights monsters and solves puzzles while searching for eight musical instruments that will awaken the sleeping Wind Fish and allow him to escape from the island . Development began as an effort to port the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past to the Game Boy , developed after-hours by Nintendo staff . It grew into an original project under the direction of Takashi Tezuka , with a story and script created by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kensuke Tanabe . The majority of the Link to the Past team reassembled for Link 's Awakening , and Tezuka wanted the game world to feel like the television series Twin Peaks . After a development period of one and a half years , Link 's Awakening was released in Japan in June 1993 and worldwide later in the year . Link 's Awakening was critically and commercially successful . Critics praised the game 's depth and number of features ; complaints focused on its control scheme and monochrome graphics . An updated rerelease , The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening DX , [ b ] was released for the Game Boy Color in 1998 featuring color graphics , compatibility with the Game Boy Printer , and an exclusive color-based dungeon",

Taking place in ancient Persia , players control an unnamed protagonist who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the Grand Vizier Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess .
