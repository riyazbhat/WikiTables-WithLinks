  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Classical_Revival_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Department_store": "A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as departments . In modern major cities , the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century , and permanently reshaped shopping habits , and the definition of service and luxury . Similar developments were under way in London ( with Whiteleys ) , in Paris ( Le Bon March\u00e9 in 1852 ) and in New York ( with Stewart 's ) . Today , departments often include the following : clothing , furniture , home appliances , toys , cosmetics , houseware , gardening , toiletries , sporting goods , do it yourself , paint , and hardware . Additionally , other lines of products such as food , books , jewelry , electronics , stationery , photographic equipment , baby products , and products for pets are sometimes included . Customers generally check out near the front of the store , although some stores include sales counters within each department . Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain , while others are independent retailers . In the 1970s , they came under heavy pressure from discounters , and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010 . Big-box stores , hypermarkets , and discount stores are comparable to historical department stores .",
  "/wiki/Vaudeville": "Vaudeville ( /\u02c8v\u0254\u02d0d ( \u0259 ) v\u026al/ ; French : [ vodvil ] ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 19th century . A vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions , based on a comical situation : a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry , interspersed with songs or ballets . It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s , but the idea of vaudeville 's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent . In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain , a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate , unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill . Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians , singers , dancers , comedians , trained animals , magicians , ventriloquists , strongmen , female and male impersonators , acrobats , clowns , illustrated songs , jugglers , one-act plays or scenes from plays , athletes , lecturing celebrities , minstrels , and movies . A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a vaudevillian . Vaudeville developed from many sources , also including the concert saloon , minstrelsy , freak shows , dime museums , and literary American burlesque . Called the heart of American show business , vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades .",
  "/wiki/Motion_picture": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement .",

  "/wiki/Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows": "The Independent Order of Odd Fellows ( IOOF ) is a non-political and non-sectarian international fraternal order of Odd Fellowship . It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore , Maryland , United States . Evolving from the Order of Odd Fellows founded in England during the 1700s , the IOOF was originally chartered by the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity in England but has operated as an independent organization since 1842 , although it maintains an inter-fraternal relationship with the English Order . The order is also known as the Triple Link Fraternity , referring to the order 's Triple Links symbol , alluding to its motto Friendship , Love and Truth . While several unofficial Odd Fellows lodges had existed in New York City circa 1806-1818 , because of its charter relationship , the American Odd Fellows is regarded as being founded with Washington Lodge No 1 in Baltimore at the Seven Stars Tavern on April 26 , 1819 , by Thomas Wildey along with some associates who assembled in response to an advertisement in the New Republic . The following year , the lodge affiliated with the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity and was granted the authority to institute new lodges . Previously , Wildey had joined the Grand United Order of Oddfellows ( 1798- ) in 1804 but followed through with the split of Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity ( 1810- ) before immigrating to the United States in 1817 . In 1842 , after an elementary dispute on authority , the American Lodges formed a governing system separate from the English Order , and in 1843 assumed the name Independent Order of Odd Fellows . The Independent Order of Odd Fellows became the first fraternity in the United States to include both men and women when it adopted the Beautiful Rebekah Degree on September 20 , 1851 , by initiative of Schuyler Colfax , later Vice-President of the United States . Beyond fraternal and recreational activities , the Independent Order of Odd Fellows promotes the ethic of reciprocity and charity , by implied inspiration of Judeo-Christian ethics . The largest Sovereign Grand Lodge of all fraternal orders of Odd Fellows since the 19th century , it enrolls some 600,000 members divided in approximately 10,000 lodges in 26 countries , inter-fraternally recognised by the second largest , the British-seated Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
