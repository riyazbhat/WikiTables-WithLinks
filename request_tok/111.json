Located in the Holyrood area of the capital city , Edinburgh , it is frequently referred to by the metonym Holyrood .

The most recent general election to the Parliament was held on 5 May 2016 , with the Scottish National Party winning a plurality . The original Parliament of Scotland was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland , and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . As a consequence , both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England ceased to exist , and the Parliament of Great Britain , which sat at Westminster in London was formed . Following a referendum in 1997 , in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution , the powers of the devolved legislature were specified by the Scotland Act 1998 . The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament - the areas in which it can make laws - by explicitly specifying powers that are reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster . The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws . The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999 .
