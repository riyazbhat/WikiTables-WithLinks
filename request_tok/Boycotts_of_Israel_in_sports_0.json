The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo",

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world",

The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks .

A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages .

The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court .

Although it may be played with larger teams , the most common forms of the game are singles ( with one player per side ) and doubles ( with two players per side ) . Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach ; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court . Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side 's half of the court . Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net . Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire , service judge , or ( in their absence ) the opposing side . The shuttlecock is a feathered or ( in informal matches ) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports . In particular , the feathers create much higher drag , causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly . Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports . The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature . The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock . European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia , with recent competitions dominated by China",
