  "/wiki/Red_Bull": "Red Bull is an energy drink sold by Red Bull GmbH , an Austrian company created in 1987 . Red Bull has the highest market share of any energy drink in the world , with 6.790 billion cans sold in a year ( as of 2018 [ update ] ) . Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by an existing energy drink named Krating Daeng , which was first introduced and sold in Thailand by Chaleo Yoovidhya . He took this idea , modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners , and , in partnership with Chaleo , founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong , Thailand . In Thai , daeng means red , and a krating ( known in English as a gaur or Indian bison ) is a large species of wild bovine native to South Asia . Yoovidhya 's heirs own majority stakes in both brands , and they both use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market the separate drinks to the respective Thai and Western markets . Red Bull is sold in a tall and slim blue-silver can . Originally only available in a single nondescript flavor and regular or sugar-free formulas , a line of color editions with artificial fruit flavors were added to the line beginning in 2013 . The Red Bull company slogan is Red Bull gives you wings , occasionally No Red Bull , no wings . Rather than following a traditional approach to mass marketing , Red Bull has generated awareness and created a 'brand myth ' through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series , Red Bull Air Race , Red Bull Crashed Ice and stand-out stunts such as the Stratos space diving project . Red Bull 's marketing also includes multiple sports team ownerships ( Formula One teams Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso , football clubs RB Leipzig , FC Red Bull Salzburg , FC Liefering , Red Bull Brasil and New York Red Bulls ) , celebrity endorsements , and music , through its record label Red Bull Records . Energy drinks have been associated with health risks , such as masking the effects of intoxication when consumed with alcohol , and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions .",
