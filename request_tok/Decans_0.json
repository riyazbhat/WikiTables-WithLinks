  "/wiki/Rat_(zodiac)": "The Zodiacal Rat is the first of the repeating 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac , constituting part of the Chinese calendar system ( with similar systems in use elsewhere ) . The Year of the Rat in standard Chinese is ( Chinese : \u9f20\u5e74 ; pinyin : sh\u01d4\u200bni\u00e1n ) ; the rat is associated with the first branch of the Earthly Branch symbol \u5b50 ( z\u01d0 ) , which starts a repeating cycle of twelve years . The Chinese word sh\u01d4\u200b ( \u9f20 ) may refer to rat , mouse , or other muroid-type animal . There is also a yearly month of the rat and a daily hour of the rat ( Chinese double hour , midnight , 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. ) . Years of the rat are cyclically differentiated by correlation to the Heavenly Stems cycle , resulting in a repeating cycle of five years of the rat ( over a sixty-year period ) , each rat year also being associated with one of the Chinese wu xing , also known as the five elements .",
  "/wiki/Cat": "The cat ( Felis catus ) is a small carnivorous mammal . It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family . The cat is either a house cat , a farm cat or a feral cat ; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact . Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents . About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries . The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species , has a strong flexible body , quick reflexes , sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey . Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed . Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing , purring , trilling , hissing , growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language . It is a solitary hunter , but a social species . It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears , such as those made by mice and other small mammals . It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk . It secretes and perceives pheromones .",
  "/wiki/Rat": "Rats are various medium-sized , long-tailed rodents . Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia , but stereotypical rats are found in the genus Rattus . Other rat genera include Neotoma ( pack rats ) , Bandicota ( bandicoot rats ) and Dipodomys ( kangaroo rats ) . Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size . Generally , when someone discovers a large muroid rodent , its common name includes the term rat , while if it is smaller , its name includes the term mouse . The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific .",
  "/wiki/Bat": "Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera ; [ a ] with their forelimbs adapted as wings , they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight . Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds , flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium . The smallest bat , and arguably the smallest extant mammal , is Kitti 's hog-nosed bat , which is 29-34 mm ( 1.14-1.34 in ) in length , 15 cm ( 5.91 in ) across the wings and 2-2.6 g ( 0.07-0.09 oz ) in mass . The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox , Acerodon jubatus , which can weigh 1.6 kg ( 4 lb ) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m ( 5 ft 7 in ) . The second largest order of mammals after rodents , bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide , with over 1,200 species . These were traditionally divided into two suborders : the largely fruit-eating megabats , and the echolocating microbats . But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera , with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats . Many bats are insectivores , and most of the rest are frugivores ( fruit-eaters ) . A few species feed on animals other than insects ; for example , the vampire bats feed on blood . Most bats are nocturnal , and many roost in caves or other refuges ; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators . Bats are present throughout the world , with the exception of extremely cold regions . They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds ; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services .",

  "/wiki/Cattle": "Cattle , or cows , are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates . They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae , are the most widespread species of the genus Bos , and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus . Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat ( beef or veal , see beef cattle ) , for milk ( see dairy cattle ) , and for hides , which are used to make leather . They are used as riding animals and draft animals ( oxen or bullocks , which pull carts , plows and other implements ) . Another product of cattle is dung , which can be used to create manure or fuel . In some regions , such as parts of India , cattle have significant religious meaning . Cattle , mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu , are also kept as pets . Around 10,500 years ago , cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central Anatolia , the Levant and Western Iran . According to an estimate from 2011 , there are 1.4 billion cattle in the world . In 2009 , cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome .",

  "/wiki/Turtle": "Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield . Turtle may refer to the order as a whole ( American English ) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines ( British English ) . The order Testudines includes both extant ( living ) and extinct species . The earliest known members of this group date from the Middle Jurassic , making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians . Of the 356 known species alive today , some are highly endangered . Turtles are ectotherms - animals commonly called cold-blooded - meaning that their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment . However , because of their high metabolic rate , leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water . Turtles are classified as amniotes , along with other reptiles , birds , and mammals . Like other amniotes , turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater , although many species live in or around water .",

It is the only extant species in the genus Nyctereutes . Despite its name , its closest relatives are true foxes . Among the Canidae , the raccoon dog shares the habit of regularly climbing trees only with the North American gray fox , another basal species . The raccoon dog is named for its superficial resemblance to the raccoon ( Procyon lotor ) , to which it is not closely related . In Japan , it is known as the tanuki and has a long history in folklore . In Sweden , where it is called m\u00e5rdhund ( marten-dog ) , and in Denmark , where it 's called m\u00e5rhund ( same meaning ) , it has been treated as a potentially hazardous invasive species .",
  "/wiki/Leopard": "The leopard ( Panthera pardus ) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera , a member of the Felidae . It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa , in small parts of Western and Central Asia , on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia . It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation , and are declining in large parts of the global range . In Hong Kong , Singapore , Kuwait , Syria , Libya , Tunisia and most likely in Morocco , leopard populations have already been extirpated . Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range . Leopards are hunted illegally , and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration . Compared to other wild cats , the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull . Its fur is marked with rosettes . It is similar in appearance to the jaguar , but has a smaller , lighter physique , and its rosettes are generally smaller , more densely packed and without central spots . Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers . The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur , opportunistic hunting behaviour , broad diet , strength , and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe , including arid and montane areas . It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour ( 36 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Tiger": "The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside . It is an apex predator , primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar . It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands . Since the early 20th century , tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China . Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra . The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 . As of 2015 , the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other . Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching . This , coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .",

Foxes have a flattened skull , upright triangular ears , a pointed , slightly upturned snout , and a long bushy tail ( or brush ) . Twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus Vulpes . Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes ; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes , or of the outlying group , which consists of bat-eared fox , gray fox , and island fox . Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica . By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) with about 47 recognized subspecies . The global distribution of foxes , together with their widespread reputation for cunning , has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world . The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds , long an established pursuit in Europe , especially in the British Isles , was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World .",

  "/wiki/Badger": "Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the families Mustelidae ( which also includes the otters , polecats , weasels , and ferrets ) , and Mephitidae ( which also includes the skunks ) . Badgers are a polyphyletic grouping , and are not a natural taxonomic grouping : badgers are united by possession of a squat body adapted for fossorial activity . All belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals . The 11 species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies : Melinae ( 4 species , including the European badger ) , Helictidinae ( 5 species of ferret-badger ) , Mellivorinae ( the honey badger or ratel ) , and Taxideinae ( the American badger ) ; the respective genera are Arctonyx , Meles , Melogale , Mellivora and Taxidea . Badgers include the most basal mustelids ; the American badger is the most basal of all , followed successively by the ratel and Melinae ; the estimated split dates are about 17.8 , 15.5 and 14.8 million years ago , respectively . The two species of Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae ( and thus Mustelidae ) , but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family . Badger mandibular condyles connect to long cavities in their skulls , which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength . This in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut , or sliding from side to side , but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals . Badgers have rather short , wide bodies , with short legs for digging . They have elongated , weasel-like heads with small ears . Their tails vary in length depending on species ; the stink badger has a very short tail , while the ferret badger 's tail can be 46-51 cm ( 18-20 in ) long , depending on age . They have black faces with distinctive white markings , grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail , and dark legs with light-coloured underbellies .",

  "/wiki/Dragon": "A dragon is a large , serpentine legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world . Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region , but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged , horned , four-legged , and capable of breathing fire . Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless , four-legged , serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence . The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes . Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature . Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies . Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u of ancient Mesopotamia ; Apep in Egyptian mythology ; V\u1e5btra in the Rigveda ; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible ; Python , Ladon , Wyvern , and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology ; J\u00f6rmungandr , N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr , and Fafnir in Norse mythology ; and the dragon from Beowulf . The popular western image of a dragon as winged , four-legged , and capable of breathing fire is an invention of the High Middle Ages , based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions , and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes . In western cultures , dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome , usually by saints or culture heroes , as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon . They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves , where they hoard treasure . These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature , including The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien , the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling , and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin . The word dragon has also come to be applied to the Chinese lung ( traditional \u9f8d , simplified \u9f99 , Pinyin long ) , which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain .",
  "/wiki/Shark": "Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton , five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head , and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head . Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha ( or Selachii ) and are the sister group to the rays . However , the term shark has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha , such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus , as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans . Under this broader definition , the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago . Acanthodians are often referred to as spiny sharks ; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper , they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole . Since then , sharks have diversified into over 500 species . They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark ( Etmopterus perryi ) , a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres ( 6.7 in ) in length , to the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , the largest fish in the world , which reaches approximately 12 metres ( 40 ft ) in length . Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) . They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions , such as the bull shark and the river shark , which can be found in both seawater and freshwater . Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics . They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth . Well-known species such as the tiger shark , blue shark , great white shark , mako shark , thresher shark , and hammerhead shark are apex predators - organisms at the top of their underwater food chain .",
  "/wiki/Fish": "Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits . They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term fish is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification . The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period . Although they lacked a true spine , they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts . Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era , diversifying into a wide variety of forms . Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators . The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period , after which many ( such as sharks ) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods .",
  "/wiki/Snake_(zodiac)": "The Snake ( \u86c7 ) is the sixth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar . The Year of the Snake is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol \u5df3 . According to one legend , there is a reason for the order of the 12 animals in the 12-year cycle . The story goes that a race was held to cross a great river , and the order of the animals in the cycle was based upon their order in finishing the race . In this story , the Snake compensated for not being the best swimmer by hitching a hidden ride on the Horse 's hoof , and when the Horse was just about to cross the finish line , jumping out , scaring the Horse , and thus edging it out for sixth place . The same 12 animals are also used to symbolize the cycle of hours in the day , each being associated with a two-hour time period . The hour of the Snake is 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. , the time when the Sun warms up the Earth , and Snakes are said to slither out of their holes . The month of the Snake is 5 May to 5 June . The reason the animal signs are referred to as zodiacal is that one 's personality is said to be influenced by the animal signs ruling the time of birth , together with elemental aspects of the animal signs within the sexagenary cycle . Similarly , the year governed by a particular animal sign is supposed to be characterized by it , with the effects particularly strong for people who were born in any year governed by the same animal sign . In Chinese symbology , Snakes are regarded as intelligent , but with a tendency to be somewhat unscrupulous .",

They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha , [ a ] along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers . The superfamily is divided into two families , Tettigarctidae , with two species in Australia , and Cicadidae , with more than 3,000 species described from around the world ; many species remain undescribed . Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart , short antennae , and membranous front wings . They have an exceptionally loud song , produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals . The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period ; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates . They typically live in trees , feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark . Most cicadas are cryptic . The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults , with some calling at dawn or dusk . Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal . The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs , emerging only after 13 or 17 years . The unusual duration and timing of their emergence may reduce the number of cicadas lost to predation , both by making them a less reliably available prey ( so that any predator who evolved to depended on cicadas for sustenance might starve waiting for their emergence ) , and by emerging in such huge numbers that they will satiate any remaining predators before losing enough of their number to threaten their survival as a species .",

  "/wiki/Snake": "Snakes are elongated , legless , carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes . Like all other squamates , snakes are ectothermic , amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales . Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors , enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws . To accommodate their narrow bodies , snakes ' paired organs ( such as kidneys ) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side , and most have only one functional lung . Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca . Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution , leading to many lineages of legless lizards . Legless lizards resemble snakes , but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears , which snakes lack , although this rule is not universal ( see Amphisbaenia , Dibamidae , and Pygopodidae ) . Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica , and on most smaller land masses ; exceptions include some large islands , such as Ireland , Iceland , Greenland , the Hawaiian archipelago , and the islands of New Zealand , and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans . Additionally , sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans . More than 20 families are currently recognized , comprising about 520 genera and about 3,600 species . They range in size from the tiny , 10.4 cm ( 4.1 in ) -long Barbados thread snake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters ( 22.8 ft ) in length .

Female reindeer , and male deer of all species except the Chinese water deer , grow and shed new antlers each year . In this they differ from permanently horned antelope , which are part of a different family ( Bovidae ) within the same order of even-toed ungulates ( Artiodactyla ) . The musk deer ( Moschidae ) of Asia and chevrotains ( Tragulidae ) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families within the ruminant clade ( Ruminantia ) . They are no more closely related to deer than are other even-toed ungulates . Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards , and they have played a role in mythology , religion , and literature throughout history , as well as in heraldry . Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison , their skins as soft , strong buckskin , and their antlers as handles for knives .

  "/wiki/Horse": "The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior . Horses are adapted to run , allowing them to quickly escape predators , possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down , with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .",

A sheep 's wool is the most widely used animal fiber , and is usually harvested by shearing . Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries , and lamb in the United States ( including from adults ) . Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today , and are also occasionally raised for pelts , as dairy animals , or as model organisms for science . Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world , and has been fundamental to many civilizations . In the modern era , Australia , New Zealand , the southern and central South American nations , and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production . There are a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect .",
  "/wiki/Goose": "A goose ( plural geese ) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae . This group comprises the genera Anser ( the grey geese ) , Branta ( the black geese ) , and Chen ( which includes the white geese ) , the latter being commonly placed within the genus Anser . Some other birds , mostly related to the shelducks , have goose as part of their names . More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans , most of which are larger than true geese , and ducks , which are smaller . The term goose is more properly used for a female bird , while gander refers specifically to a male one . Young birds before fledging are called goslings . The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle ; when in flight , they are called a skein , a team , or a wedge ; when flying close together , they are called a plump .",

  "/wiki/Falcon": "Falcons ( /\u02c8f\u0252lk\u0259n , \u02c8f\u0254\u02d0l- , \u02c8f\u00e6l-/ ) are birds of prey in the genus Falco , which includes about 40 species . Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica , closely related parrots . Adult falcons have thin , tapered wings , which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly . Fledgling falcons , in their first year of flying , have longer flight feathers , which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broad-wing . This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults . There are many different types of falcon . The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae , which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species . All these birds kill with their beaks , using a tooth on the side of their beaks - unlike the hawks , eagles , and other birds of prey in the Accipitridae , which use their feet . The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm in length . The smallest falcons are the kestrels , of which the Seychelles kestrel measures just 25 cm . As with hawks and owls , falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism , with the females typically larger than the males , thus allowing a wider range of prey species . Some small falcons with long , narrow wings are called hobbies and some which hover while hunting are called kestrels .",

  "/wiki/Gibbon": "Gibbons are apes in the family Hylobatidae . The family historically contained one genus , but now is split into four genera and 18 species . Gibbons live in tropical and subtropical rain forests from eastern Bangladesh and northeast India to southern China and Indonesia ( including the islands of Sumatra , Borneo , and Java ) . Also called the lesser apes or smaller apes , gibbons differ from great apes ( chimpanzees , bonobos , gorillas , orangutans and humans ) in being smaller , exhibiting low sexual dimorphism , and not making nests . In certain anatomical details , they superficially more closely resemble monkeys than great apes do , but like all apes , gibbons are tailless . Unlike most of the great apes , gibbons frequently form long-term pair bonds . Their primary mode of locomotion , brachiation , involves swinging from branch to branch for distances up to 15 m ( 50 ft ) , at speeds as high as 55 km/h ( 34 mph ) . They can also make leaps up to 8 m ( 26 ft ) , and walk bipedally with their arms raised for balance . They are the fastest and most agile of all tree-dwelling , nonflying mammals . Depending on the species and sex , gibbons ' fur coloration varies from dark to light brown shades , and any shade between black and white , though a completely white gibbon is rare . Gibbon species include the siamang , the white-handed or lar gibbon , and the hoolock gibbons .",
  "/wiki/Ape": "Apes ( Hominoidea ) are a branch of Old World tailless simians native to Africa and Southeast Asia . They are the sister group of the Old World monkeys , together forming the catarrhine clade . They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation . In traditional and non-scientific use , the term ape excludes humans , and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon Hominoidea . There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea : the gibbons , or lesser apes ; and the hominids , or great apes .",
  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys . Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini , so cladistically they are monkeys as well .",

The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven .",
  "/wiki/Chicken": "The chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) is a type of domesticated fowl , a subspecies of the red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ) . They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals , with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011 . There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl . Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food ( consuming both their meat and eggs ) and , less commonly , as pets . Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies , chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period ( 4th-2nd centuries BC ) . Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia , Southeast Asia , and East Asia , but with the clade found in the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent . From ancient India , the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor , and to Greece by the 5th century BC . Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC , with the bird that gives birth every day having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar , Babylonia , according to the annals of Thutmose III .",

Pheasants are characterised by strong sexual dimorphism , males being highly decorated with bright colors and adornments such as wattles . Males are usually larger than females and have longer tails . Males play no part in rearing the young . Pheasants typically eat seeds and some insects . The best-known is the common pheasant , which is widespread throughout the world , in introduced feral populations and in farm operations . Various other pheasant species are popular in aviaries , such as the golden pheasant ( Chrysolophus pictus ) .",

  "/wiki/Dog": "The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species ) is a member of the genus Canis ( canines ) , which forms part of the wolf-like canids , and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore . The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated , which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct . The dog was the first species to be domesticated , and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids . Dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors . They perform many roles for humans , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship and , more recently , aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles . This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man 's best friend .",

  "/wiki/Wolf": "The wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of Canidae , with males averaging 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and females 37 kg ( 82 lb ) . On average , wolves measure 105-160 cm ( 41-63 in ) in length and 80-85 cm ( 31-33 in ) at shoulder height . The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features , particularly the ears and muzzle . The wolf is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the coyote and the golden jackal , to produce fertile hybrids with them . The winter fur of a wolf is long and bushy and predominantly mottled gray , although nearly pure white , red and brown to black colours also occur . Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog . The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis for cooperative big game hunting , as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey , its more social nature , and its highly advanced expressive behaviour . It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring . Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack for food . Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality . The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage .",
  "/wiki/Dhole": "The dhole /do\u028al/ ( Cuon alpinus ) is a canid native to Central , South , East Asia , and Southeast Asia . Other English names for the species include Asian wild dog , Asiatic wild dog , Indian wild dog , whistling dog , red dog , and mountain wolf . It is genetically close to species within the genus Canis , ( Fig . 10 ) but distinct in several anatomical aspects : its skull is convex rather than concave in profile , it lacks a third lower molar and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four . During the Pleistocene , the dhole ranged throughout Asia , Europe , and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12,000-18,000 years ago . The dhole is a highly social animal , living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females . Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals , but groups of over 40 are known . It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets medium- and large-sized ungulates . In tropical forests , the dhole competes with tiger and leopard , targeting somewhat different prey species , but still with substantial dietary overlap . It is listed as Endangered by the IUCN as populations are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than 2,500 adults . Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss , loss of prey , competition with other species , persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from domestic dogs .",

  "/wiki/Pig_(zodiac)": "The Pig ( \u8c6c ) is the twelfth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in Chinese zodiac , in relation to the Chinese calendar and system of horology , and paralleling the system of ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches . Although the term zodiac ( etymologically referring to a [ circle of ] little animals ) is used in the phrase Chinese zodiac , there is a major difference between the Chinese usage and Western astrology : the zodiacal animals ( including the zodiacal Pig ) do not relate to the zodiac as the area of the sky that extends approximately 8\u00b0 north or south ( as measured in celestial latitude ) of the ecliptic , the apparent path of the Sun , the Moon , and visible planets across the celestial sphere 's constellations , over the course of the year . In Chinese astrology , zodiacal animals refer to fixed cycles of twelve animals . The same cycle of twelve is used for cycles of years and cycles of hours . In the case of years , the cycle of twelve corresponds to the twelve-year cycle of Jupiter . In the case of the hours , the twelve hours represent twelve double-hours for each period of night and day . In the continuous sexagenary cycle of sixty years , every twelfth year corresponds to hai , \u4ea5 ( the twelfth of the twelve Earthly Branches ) ; this re-recurring twelfth year is commonly called the Year of the Pig ( \u8c6c\u5e74 ) . There are five types of Pigs , named after the Chinese elements . In order , they are : Metal , Water , Wood , Fire , and Earth . These correspond to the Heavenly Stems . Thus , there are five pig years in every sexegenary cycle . For example , in the year 2019 , the Earthly Branch is the twelfth , h\u00e0i , and the Heavenly Stem is the sixth , j\u01d0 \u5df1 .",

  "/wiki/Domestic_pig": "The domestic pig ( Sus scrofa domesticus or only Sus domesticus ) , often called swine , hog , or simply pig when there is no need to distinguish them from other pigs , is a domesticated large , even-toed ungulates . They are variously considered a subspecies of the Eurasian boar or a distinct species . The domestic pig 's head-plus-body-length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m ( 35 to 71 in ) , and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg ( 110 and 770 lb ) , with well-fed individuals often exceeding this weight range . The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed . Compared to other artiodactyls , a pig 's head is relatively long , pointed , and free of warts . Even-toed ungulates are generally herbivorous , but the domestic pigs are omnivores , like their wild relative . When used as livestock , domestic pigs are farmed primarily for the consumption of their flesh , called pork . The animal 's bones , hide , and bristles are also used in commercial products . Domestic pigs , especially miniature breeds , are kept as pets .",
  "/wiki/Wild_boar": "The wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) , also known as the wild swine , Common wild pig , or simply wild pig , is a suid native to much of the Americas , Eurasia , North Africa , and the Greater Sunda Islands . Human intervention has spread its distribution further , making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world , as well as the most widely spread suiform . Its wide range , high numbers , and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range . The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene , and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World . As of 1990 , up to 16 subspecies are recognized , which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length . The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young ( both male and female ) . Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season . The grey wolf , coyote , american alligator , jaguar , bobcat , lynx , cougar , and black bear , and brown bear is the wild boar 's main predators in the world , throughout most of its range , except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands , where it is replaced by the tiger , leopard , asiatic lion , and Komodo dragon , respectively . It has a long history of association with humans , having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia . Boars have also re-hybridized in recent decades with feral pigs ; these boar-pig hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in Australia , Canada , United States , and Mexico ."
