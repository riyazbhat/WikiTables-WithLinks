  "/wiki/Talc": "Talc is a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula Mg3Si4O10 ( OH ) 2 . Talc in powdered form , often in combination with corn starch , is widely used as baby powder . This mineral is used as a thickening agent and lubricant , is an ingredient in ceramics , paint and roofing material , and is also one of the main ingredients in many cosmetic products . It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses , and in an exceptionally rare crystal form . It has a perfect basal cleavage , uneven flat fracture and it is foliated with a two dimensional platy form . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on scratch hardness comparison , ranging from 1-10 , a value of 10 being the hardest of minerals . Talc is the defining value 1 and therefore the softest of minerals . Any mineral below a value of 2 on Mohs scale of mineral hardness can be scratched by a fingernail . When scraped on a streak plate it produces a white streak , though this indicator is of little importance because most silicate minerals produce a white streak . Talc is translucent to opaque with colors ranging from whitish grey to green with a vitreous and pearly luster . Talc is not soluble in water , but is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids . Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed predominantly of talc",
  "/wiki/Gypsum": "Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate , with the chemical formula CaSO4\u00b72H2O . It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster , blackboard/sidewalk chalk , and drywall . A massive fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum , called alabaster , has been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , Ancient Rome , the Byzantine Empire , and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England . Gypsum also crystallizes as translucent crystals of selenite . It also forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines hardness value 2 as gypsum based on scratch hardness comparison",
  "/wiki/Calcite": "Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness , based on scratch hardness comparison , defines value 3 as calcite . Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite . Aragonite will change to calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300 \u00b0C , and vaterite is even less stable",
  "/wiki/Fluorite": "Fluorite ( also called fluorspar ) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride , CaF2 . It belongs to the halide minerals . It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit , although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness , based on scratch hardness comparison , defines value 4 as Fluorite . Pure fluorite is transparent , both in visible and ultraviolet light , but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses . Industrially , fluorite is used as a flux for smelting , and in the production of certain glasses and enamels . The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture , which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals . Optically clear transparent fluorite lenses have low dispersion , so lenses made from it exhibit less chromatic aberration , making them valuable in microscopes and telescopes . Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges , where conventional glasses are too absorbent for use",
  "/wiki/Apatite": "Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals , usually referring to hydroxyapatite , fluorapatite and chlorapatite , with high concentrations of OH\u2212 , F\u2212 and Cl\u2212 ions , respectively , in the crystal . The formula of the admixture of the three most common endmembers is written as Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6 ( OH , F , Cl ) 2 , and the crystal unit cell formulae of the individual minerals are written as Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 , Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6F2 and Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6Cl2 . The mineral was named apatite by the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1786 , although the specific mineral he had described was reclassified as fluorapatite in 1860 by the German mineralogist Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg . Apatite is often mistaken for other minerals . This tendency is reflected in the mineral 's name , which is derived from the Greek word \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd ( apatein ) , which means to deceive or to be misleading",
  "/wiki/Orthoclase": "Orthoclase , or orthoclase feldspar ( endmember formula KAlSi3O8 ) , is an important tectosilicate mineral which forms igneous rock . The name is from the Ancient Greek for straight fracture , because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other . It is a type of potassium feldspar , also known as K-feldspar . The gem known as moonstone ( see below ) is largely composed of orthoclase",
  "/wiki/Quartz": "Quartz is a hard , crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms . The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra , giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2 . Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth 's continental crust , behind feldspar . Quartz exists in two forms , the normal \u03b1-quartz and the high-temperature \u03b2-quartz , both of which are chiral . The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 \u00b0C ( 846 K ; 1,063 \u00b0F ) . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume , it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold . There are many different varieties of quartz , several of which are semi-precious gemstones . Since antiquity , varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings , especially in Eurasia",
  "/wiki/Topaz": "Topaz is a silicate mineral of aluminium and fluorine with the chemical formula Al2SiO4 ( F , OH ) 2 . Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombic system , and its crystals are mostly prismatic terminated by pyramidal and other faces . It is one of the hardest naturally occurring minerals ( Mohs hardness of 8 ) and is the hardest of any silicate mineral . This hardness combined with its usual transparency and variety of colors means that it has acquired wide use in jewellery as a cut gemstone as well as for intaglios and other gemstone carvings",
  "/wiki/Corundum": "Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide ( Al2O3 ) typically containing traces of iron , titanium , vanadium and chromium . It is a rock-forming mineral . It is also a naturally transparent material , but can have different colors depending on the presence of transition metal impurities in its crystalline structure . Corundum has two primary gem varieties : ruby and sapphire . Rubies are red due to the presence of chromium , and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present . A rare type of sapphire , padparadscha sapphire , is pink-orange . The name corundum is derived from the Tamil-Dravidian word kurundam ( ruby-sapphire ) ( appearing in Sanskrit as kuruvinda ) . Because of corundum 's hardness ( pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 on the Mohs scale ) , it can scratch almost every other mineral . It is commonly used as an abrasive on everything from sandpaper to large tools used in machining metals , plastics , and wood . Some emery is a mix of corundum and other substances , and the mix is less abrasive , with an average Mohs hardness of 8.0 . In addition to its hardness , corundum has a density of 4.02 g/cm3 ( 251 lb/cu ft ) , which is unusually high for a transparent mineral composed of the low-atomic mass elements aluminium and oxygen",
  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD )"
