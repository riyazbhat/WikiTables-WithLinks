  "/wiki/Garth_Marenghi's_Darkplace": "Garth Marenghi 's Darkplace is a British horror parody television series created for Channel 4 by Richard Ayoade and Matthew Holness . The show focuses on fictional horror author Garth Marenghi ( played by Holness ) and his publisher Dean Learner ( played by Ayoade ) , characters who originated in the Garth Marenghi 's Fright Knight stage show . Darkplace is presented as a lost classic : a television series produced in the 1980s , though not broadcast at the time . The presentation features commentary from many of the original cast , where characters such as Marenghi and Learner reflect on making the show . Darkplace parodies the fashion , special effects , production gaffes , and music of low-budget '80s television , as well as the modern practice of including commentary tracks on DVD releases of old films and television shows . Darkplace was broadcast in a late-night timeslot , with very little advertising , and met with poor viewing figures . It nonetheless built up a significant internet following , leading Channel 4 to repeat the series and produce a DVD release . In 2005 , Channel 4 's Film Four asked Holness and Ayoade to write a script for a movie version of their programme . The show was later broadcast in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel and Adult Swim .",
