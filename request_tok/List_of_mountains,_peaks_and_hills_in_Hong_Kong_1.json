  "/wiki/British_people": "The British people , or Britons , are the citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , the British Overseas Territories , and the Crown dependencies . British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality , which can be acquired , for instance , by descent from British nationals . When used in a historical context , British or Britons can refer to the Celtic Britons , the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain and Brittany , whose surviving members are the modern Welsh people , Cornish people , and Bretons . It may also refer to citizens of the former British Empire . Though early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages , the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity . The notion of Britishness was forged during the Napoleonic Wars between Britain and the First French Empire , and developed further during the Victorian era . The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a particular sense of nationhood and belonging in Great Britain and Ireland ; Britishness became superimposed on much older identities , of English , Scots , Welsh and Irish cultures , whose distinctiveness still resists notions of a homogenised British identity . Because of longstanding ethno-sectarian divisions , British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial , but it is held with strong conviction by Unionists . Modern Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic groups that settled in Great Britain in and before the 11th century : Prehistoric , Brittonic , Roman , Anglo-Saxon , Norse and Normans . The progressive political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration , cultural and linguistic exchange , and intermarriage between the peoples of England , Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages , early modern period and beyond . Since 1922 and earlier , there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from what is now the Republic of Ireland , the Commonwealth , mainland Europe and elsewhere ; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens , with some assuming a British , dual or hyphenated identity . The British are a diverse , multinational , multicultural and multilingual society , with strong regional accents , expressions and identities .",

  "/wiki/Commodore_(rank)": "Commodore is a naval rank used in many navies that is superior to a navy captain , but below a rear admiral . It is either regarded as the lowest of the flag officers rank or may not hold the jurisdiction of a flag officer at all depending on the officer 's appointment . Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of flotilla admiral , counter admiral , or senior captain as an equivalent , although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral . Traditionally , commodore is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time , even temporarily , much as captain is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer 's official title in the service is a lower rank . As an official rank , a commodore typically commands a flotilla or squadron of ships as part of a larger task force or naval fleet commanded by an admiral . A commodore 's ship is typically designated by the flying of a broad pennant , as opposed to an admiral 's flag . It is often regarded as a one-star rank with a NATO code of OF-6 ( which is known in the U.S. as rear admiral ( lower half ) ) , but whether it is regarded as a flag rank varies between countries . It is sometimes abbreviated : as Cdre in British Royal Navy , CDRE in the US Navy , Cmdre in the Royal Canadian Navy , COMO in the Spanish Navy and in some navies speaking the Spanish language , or CMDE as used in some other Navies of several countries .",
