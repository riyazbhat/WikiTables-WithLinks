[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The ninth ship of her class , she is named in honor of Ronald W. Reagan , President of the United States from 1981 to 1989 . Upon her christening in 2001 , she was the first ship to be named for a former president still alive at the time . As of May 2012 , the ship was operationally part of Carrier Strike Group Nine and administratively under the command of Commander , Naval Air Forces Pacific/Commander , Naval Air Forces . The two administrative titles actually refer to one command carrying out two functions . In October 2015 , Ronald Reagan replaced USS George Washington as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group Five , the only forward-based carrier strike group home-ported at Yokosuka , Japan , as part of the United States Seventh Fleet .",
  "/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier": "The Nimitz class is a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy . The lead ship of the class is named after World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , who was the second-to-last living U.S. Navy officer to hold the rank , preceding William Halsey Jr. With an overall length of 1,092 ft ( 333 m ) and full-load displacement of over 100,000 long tons ( 100,000 t ) , the Nimitz-class ships were the largest warships built and in service until USS Gerald R. Ford entered the fleet in 2017 . Instead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships , the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots ( 56 km/h ) and maximum power of around 260,000 shaft horsepower ( 190 MW ) . As a result of the use of nuclear power , the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years . They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers between CVN-68 and CVN-77 . [ Note 1 ] All ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia . USS Nimitz , the lead ship of the class , was commissioned on 3 May 1975 , and USS George H.W . Bush , the tenth and last of the class , was commissioned on 10 January 2009 . Since the 1970s , Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world , including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran , the Gulf War , and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan . The angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft , with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery . As well as speeding up flight deck operations , this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers . An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board .",
  "/wiki/Supercarrier": "An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase , equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying , arming , deploying , and recovering aircraft . Typically , it is the capital ship of a fleet , as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations . Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighters , strike aircraft , helicopters , and other types of aircraft . While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers , it is currently not possible to land them . By its diplomatic and tactical power , its mobility , its autonomy and the variety of its means , the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets . Tactically or even strategically , it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of a fleet . One of its great advantages is that , by sailing in international waters , it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries , reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone .",

  "/wiki/Suspension_bridge": "A suspension bridge ( more precisely , suspended-deck suspension bridge ) is a type of bridge in which the deck ( the load-bearing portion ) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders . The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s . Simple suspension bridges , which lack vertical suspenders , have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world . This type of bridge has cables suspended between towers , with vertical suspender cables that transfer the live and dead loads of the deck below , upon which traffic crosses . This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance . Like other suspension bridge types , this type often is constructed without falsework . The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge , since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables . The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports , and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground . The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods , called hangers . In some circumstances , the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span , otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans , running between either pair of pillars and the highway , which may be supported by suspender cables or their own trusswork . In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables .",

This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",
  "/wiki/Paraguay": "Paraguay ( /\u02c8p\u00e6r\u0259\u0261wa\u026a/ ; Spanish pronunciation : [ pa\u027ea\u02c8\u0263waj ] ( listen ) ; Guarani : Paragu\u00e1i , [ pa\u027ea\u02c8\u0270waj ] ) , officially the Republic of Paraguay ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay ; Guarani : Tet\u00e3 Paragu\u00e1i ) , is a country in South America . It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",
  "/wiki/Itaipu_Dam": "The Itaipu Dam ( Portuguese : Barragem de Itaipu , Spanish : Represa de Itaip\u00fa ; Portuguese pronunciation : [ it\u0250j\u02c8pu ] , Spanish pronunciation : [ itai\u02c8pu ] ) is a hydroelectric dam on the Paran\u00e1 River located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay . The construction of the dam was first contested by Argentina , but the negotiations and resolution of the dispute ended up setting the basis for Argentine-Brazilian integration later on . The name Itaipu was taken from an isle that existed near the construction site . In the Guarani language , Itaipu means the sounding stone . The Itaipu Dam 's hydroelectric power plant produced the most energy of any in the world as of 2016 , setting a new world record of 103,098,366 megawatt hours ( MWh ) , and surpassed the Three Gorges Dam plant in energy production in 2015 and 2016 . Completed in 1984 , it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries , 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) north of the Friendship Bridge . The project ranges from Foz do Igua\u00e7u , in Brazil , and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay , in the south to Gua\u00edra and Salto del Guair\u00e1 in the north . The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14 GW , with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres ( 387 ft ) . In 2016 , the plant employed 3038 workers . Of the twenty generator units currently installed , ten generate at 50 Hz for Paraguay and ten generate at 60 Hz for Brazil . Since the output capacity of the Paraguayan generators far exceeds the load in Paraguay , most of their production is exported directly to the Brazilian side , from where two 600 kV HVDC lines , each approximately 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) long , carry the majority of the energy to the S\u00e3o Paulo/Rio de Janeiro region where the terminal equipment converts the power to 60 Hz .",

It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers . The name Paran\u00e1 is an abbreviation of the phrase para rehe on\u00e1va , which comes from the Tupi language and means like the sea ( that is , as big as the sea ) . [ citation needed ] It merges first with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the R\u00edo de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean . The first European to go up the Paran\u00e1 River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot , in 1526 , while working for Spain .",
