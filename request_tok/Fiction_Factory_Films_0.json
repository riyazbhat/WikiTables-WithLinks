  "/wiki/Satellite_City": "Satellite City is a Welsh sitcom which started out originally as a radio show on BBC Radio Wales in 1994 and then evolved into a TV version made by BBC Wales and was first broadcast in 1996 . The setting was an imaginary small town in the South Wales Valleys . The plot centred on the arrival of Randy ( Michael Neill ) , an American visitor , who was taken in by the Price family ( but had to share a bed with pensioner Idris , played by Islwyn Morris ) . Randy soon formed a relationship with local girl Mandy ( Shelley Miranda Barrett ) . The other main characters were Idris 's son , Gwynne ( played by Boyd Clack , who also co-wrote the series ) , Gwynne 's wife Moira ( Ri Richards ) , barman Dai ( Rhodri Hugh ) , and Mandy 's friend Bridget ( Einir Sion ) , replaced in the final series by the character of Donna ( Kirsten Clark ) . In the final episode Randy moved into his own house with Mandy . There are continual references to Idris 's ferret Sylvester ( his beloved pet ) , and he eventually discovers that it is , in fact , a girl ferret . The reason for the title is explained in the first episode : the district had been used for the initial testing of satellite dishes , but when the time came to return the dishes or pay for the service , no one returned them and no one paid . Satellite City thus suggests a run-down area . In 1999 the series won a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Light Entertainment . A pilot , eighteen 30-minute episodes and a one-hour special were made in all . The pilot was significantly different from the remainder of the series , portraying Idris as senile and deluded into believing that clothes pegs are talking to him .",
