Yemen joined as a member on 5 May 1945 . Currently , the League has 22 members , but Syria 's participation has been suspended since November 2011 . The League 's main goal is to draw closer the relations between member states and co-ordinate collaboration between them , to safeguard their independence and sovereignty , and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries . Through institutions , such as the Arab League Educational , Cultural and Scientific Organization ( ALECSO ) and the Economic and Social Council of the Arab League 's Council of Arab Economic Unity ( CAEU ) , the Arab League facilitates political , economic , cultural , scientific , and social programmes designed to promote the interests of the Arab world .

The League has served as a platform for the drafting and conclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration . One example is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter , which outlines the principles for economic activities in the region .",

The black was the Abbasid dynastic color ; green was the Umayyad dynastic color ; white was the Fatimid dynastic color ; and red was the Hashemite dynastic color.The four colors derived their potency from a verse by 14th century Iraqi poet Safi al-Din al-Hilli : White are our acts , black our battles , green our fields , and red our swords . Pan-Arab colors were first combined in 1916 in the flag of the Arab Revolt , designed by the British diplomat Sir Mark Sykes . Many current flags are based on Arab Revolt colors , such as the flags of Jordan , Kuwait , Palestine , the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic , and the United Arab Emirates , and formerly in the flag of the brief ( six month ) union of the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan . From the 1950s onwards , a sub-set of the Pan-Arab colors , the Arab Liberation colors , came to prominence . These consist of a tricolor of red , white and black bands , with green given less prominence . The Arab Liberation colors were inspired by the use of the Arab Liberation Flag in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 .

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
