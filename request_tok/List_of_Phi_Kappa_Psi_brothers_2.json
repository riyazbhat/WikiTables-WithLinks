  "/wiki/Mr._Clean": "Mr. Clean is a brand name and mascot fully owned by Procter & Gamble , used for an all-purpose cleaner and later also for a melamine foam abrasive sponge . The all-purpose cleaner was originally formulated by Linwood Burton , a marine ship cleaning businessman with accounts throughout the east coast of the United States and his friend , Mathusan Chandramohan , a rich entrepreneur from Sri Lanka . In the past , ships had to be cleaned using abrasives or solvents that were able to cut successfully through embedded grease and grime ; however , past solvents were so dangerous to workers that Burton was motivated to finding a solution that was effective and less caustic . Burton , with fundamental knowledge in chemistry , developed Mr. Clean in an effort to clean ships without having to pay significant premiums in disability claims for his workers . He later sold the product to Procter & Gamble in 1958 . Mr. Clean made his television commercial debut in 1958 , initially portrayed in the live-action versions by character actor House Peters Jr .

Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell .

  "/wiki/New_Hampshire_House_of_Representatives": "The New Hampshire House of Representatives is the lower house in the New Hampshire General Court , the bicameral legislature of the state of New Hampshire . The House of Representatives consists of 400 members coming from 204 legislative districts across the state , created from divisions of the state 's counties . On average , each legislator represents about 3,300 residents . Districts vary in number of seats based on their populations , with the least-populous districts electing only one member and the most populous electing 11 . In multi-member districts , voters are allowed to cast as many votes as there are seats to be filled ; for instance , in a two-member district , a voter can vote for up to two candidates . This system often results in one party winning all of the seats in the district , as the ( cross-sectional ) results below for the current representation attest . Unlike in many state legislatures , there is no single aisle to cross per se , as members of both parties sit partially segregated in five sections . The seat section and number is put on the legislator 's motor vehicle license plate , which they pay for if they wish to put one on their personal automobiles , or in the case of the chairpersons and party leaders , their title is put on the legislative plate . Seating location is enforced , as seating is pre-assigned , although the personal preference of the legislator is asked , usually chairmen and those with special needs are given the preferred aisle seats . The sixth section is the Speaker 's seat at the head of the hall . The House of Representatives has met in Representatives Hall of the New Hampshire State House since 1819 . Representatives Hall is thus the oldest chamber in the United States still in continuous legislative use .",

It had the 6th highest circulation for American newspapers in 2017 . In the 1850s , under Joseph Medill , the Chicago Tribune became closely associated with Illinois ' favorite son , Abraham Lincoln , and with the Republican Party . In the 20th century under Medill 's grandson , Robert R.

  "/wiki/Chief_Joseph": "Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt ( or Hinmat\u00f3owyalahtq\u0313it in Americanist orthography ) , popularly known as Chief Joseph , Young Joseph , or Joseph the Younger ( March 3 , 1840 - September 21 , 1904 ) , was a leader of the Wal-lam-wat-kain ( Wallowa ) band of Nez Perce , a Native American tribe of the interior Pacific Northwest region of the United States , in the latter half of the 19th century . He succeeded his father Tuekakas ( Chief Joseph the Elder ) in the early 1870s . Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history , when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory . A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal , including Joseph 's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe , to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people , who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull . At least 700 men , women , and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1,170-mile ( 1,900 km ) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War . The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public , and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce . In October 1877 , after months of fugitive resistance , most of the surviving remnants of Joseph 's band were cornered in northern Montana Territory , just 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unable to fight any longer , Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho . He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington , where he died in 1904 . Chief Joseph 's life remains iconic of the American Indian Wars . For his passionate , principled resistance to his tribe 's forced removal , Joseph became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker .",

Members of the Sahaptin language group , the Niim\u00edipuu were the dominant people of the Columbia Plateau for much of that time , especially after acquiring the horses that led them to breed the appaloosa horse in the 18th century . Prior to first contact with Western civilization the Nimiipuu were economically and culturally influential in trade and war , interacting with other indigenous nations in a vast network from the western shores of Oregon and Washington , the high plains of Montana , and the northern Great Basin in southern Idaho and northern Nevada . After first contact , the name Nez Perce was given to the Niim\u00edipuu and the nearby Chinook people by French explorers and trappers . The name means pierced nose , but only the Chinook used that form of decoration . Today they are a federally recognized tribe , the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho , and govern their Indian reservation in Idaho through a central government headquartered in Lapwai , Idaho known as the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee ( NPTEC ) . They are one of five federally recognized tribes in the state of Idaho . Some still speak their traditional language , and the Tribe owns and operates two casinos along the Clearwater River in Idaho in Kamiah , Idaho and outside of Lewiston , Idaho , health clinics , a police force and court , community centers , salmon fisheries , radio station , and other things that promote economic and cultural self-determination . Cut off from most of their horticultural sites throughout the Camas Prairie by an 1863 treaty , confinement to reservations in Idaho , Washington and Oklahoma Indian Territory after the Nez Perce War of 1877 , and Dawes Act of 1887 land allotments ( today some Nez Perce lease land to farmers or loggers , but the Nez Perce only own 12% of their own reservation ) , the Nez Perce remain as a distinct culture and political economic influence within and outside their reservation . Today , hatching , harvesting and eating salmon is an important cultural and economic strength of the Nez Perce through full ownership or co-management of various salmon fish hatcheries , such as the Kooskia National Fish Hatchery in Kooskia , Idaho or the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery in Orofino , Idaho .",

The battle , which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces , was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1876 . It took place on June 25-26 , 1876 , along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory . The fight was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho , who were led by several major war leaders , including Crazy Horse and Chief Gall , and had been inspired by the visions of Sitting Bull ( T\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka \u00cdyotake ) . The U.S. 7th Cavalry , a force of 700 men , suffered a major defeat while under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer ( formerly a brevetted major general during the American Civil War ) . Five of the 7th Cavalry 's twelve companies were annihilated and Custer was killed , as were two of his brothers , a nephew and a brother-in-law . The total U.S. casualty count included 268 dead and 55 severely wounded ( six died later from their wounds ) , :244 including four Crow Indian scouts and at least two Arikara Indian scouts . Public response to the Great Sioux War varied in the immediate aftermath of the battle . Libbie Custer , Custer 's widow , soon worked to burnish her husband 's memory , and during the following decades Custer and his troops came to be considered iconic , even heroic , figures in American history . The battle , and Custer 's actions in particular , have been studied extensively by historians . Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument honors those who fought on both sides .",
