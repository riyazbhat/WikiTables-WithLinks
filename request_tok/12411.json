  "/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome": "The Pantheon ( UK : /\u02c8p\u00e6n\u03b8i\u0259n/ , US : /-\u0252n/ ; Latin : Pantheum , [ nb 1 ] from Greek \u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd Pantheion , [ temple ] of all the gods ) is a former Roman temple , now a Catholic church ( Basilica di Santa Maria ad Martyres or Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs ) , in Rome , Italy , on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus ( 27 BC - 14 AD ) . It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD . Its date of construction is uncertain , because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa 's older temple , which had burned down . The building is cylindrical with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns ( eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind ) under a pediment . A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda , which is under a coffered concrete dome , with a central opening ( oculus ) to the sky . Almost two thousand years after it was built , the Pantheon 's dome is still the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 metres ( 142 ft ) . It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings , in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history and , since the 7th century , the Pantheon has been in use as a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs ( Latin : Sancta Maria ad Martyres ) but informally known as Santa Maria Rotonda . The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda . The Pantheon is a state property , managed by Italy 's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio ; in 2013 it was visited by over 6 million people . The Pantheon 's large circular domed cella , with a conventional temple portico front , was unique in Roman architecture . Nevertheless , it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived , and has been copied many times by later architects .",
  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

  "/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla": "The Baths of Caracalla ( Italian : Terme di Caracalla ) in Rome , Italy , were the city 's second largest Roman public baths , or thermae , likely built between AD 212 ( or 211 ) and 216/217 , during the reigns of emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla . They were in operation until the 530s and then fell into disuse and ruin . However , they have served as an inspiration for many other notable buildings , including the Baths of Diocletian , Basilica of Maxentius , the original Pennsylvania Station ( New York ) and Chicago Union Station . Art works recovered from the ruins include famous sculptures such as the Farnese Bull and the Farnese Hercules . Today the Baths of Caracalla are a tourist attraction .",
  "/wiki/Caldarium": "A caldarium ( also called a calidarium , cella caldaria or cella coctilium ) was a room with a hot plunge bath , used in a Roman bath complex . This was a very hot and steamy room heated by a hypocaust , an underfloor heating system using tunnels with hot air , heated by a furnace tended by slaves . This was the hottest room in the regular sequence of bathing rooms ; after the caldarium , bathers would progress back through the warm bathroom to the cold water room . In the caldarium , there would be a bath ( alveus , piscina calida or solium ) of hot water sunk into the floor and there was sometimes even a laconicum - a hot , dry area for inducing sweating . The bath 's patrons would use olive oil to cleanse themselves by applying it to their bodies and using a strigil to remove the excess . This was sometimes left on the floor for the slaves to pick up or put back in the pot for the women to use for their hair . The temperature of the caldarium is not known exactly : however , since the Romans used sandals with a wooden sole , it could not be higher than 50-55 \u00b0C ( 122-131 \u00b0F ) . The bather would wait long enough for the perspiration to start , in order to guard against the danger of passing too suddenly into the high temperature of the next room .

  "/wiki/Baiae": "Baiae ( Italian : Baia ; Neapolitan : Baia ) was an ancient Roman town situated on the northwest shore of the Gulf of Naples and now in the comune of Bacoli . It was a fashionable resort for centuries in antiquity , particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic , when it was reckoned as superior to Capri , Pompeii , and Herculaneum by the super-rich , who built luxurious villas here from 100 BC to 500 AD . It was notorious for its hedonistic offerings and the attendant rumours of corruption and scandal . The lower part of the town later became submerged in the sea due to local volcanic , bradyseismic activity which raised or lowered the land , and recent underwater archaeology has revealed many of the fine buildings now protected in the submerged archaeological park . Many impressive buildings from the upper town can be seen in the Parco Archeologico delle Terme di Baia .",
  "/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Maxentius": "The Mausoleum of Maxentius was part of a large complex on the Appian Way in Rome that included a palace and a chariot racing circus , constructed by the Emperor Maxentius . The large circular tomb was built by Maxentius in the early 4th century , probably with himself in mind and as a family tomb , but when his young son Valerius Romulus died he was buried there . After extensive renovation the mausoleum was reopened to the public in 2014 . Maxentius may have decided to build the mausoleum on the Appian Way because , according to Roman custom , all bodies had to be buried outside the city . The complex is very close to several catacombs . The mausoleum is believed to have been a two-story , cylindrical rotunda with a diameter of around 35 metres , but only its semi-underground floor survives . There is a central octagonal pillar with a diameter of more than nine meters and this is circled by a seven-meter-wide , vaulted corridor with open niches for the sarcophagi . There is no trace of floor or wall decoration , suggesting that the building was never completed . An 18th century home largely obscures the mausoleum from the Appian Way and stands where a columnar porch once framed the tombs principal entrance . This was originally a farmhouse and was later converted into a home by the Torlonia family , who owned it until it was taken over by the Fascist government in 1943 .",

Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes , while balneae were smaller-scale facilities , public or private , that existed in great numbers throughout Rome . Most Roman cities had at least one - if not many - such buildings , which were centres not only for bathing , but socializing and reading as well . Bath-houses were also provided for wealthy private villas , town houses , and for forts . They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream , or within cities by aqueduct . The water would be heated by fire then channelled into the caldarium ( hot bathing room ) . The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in De architectura ( V.10 ) .",

However , the building of the current choir gallery , apse , and transepts occurred later , beginning under Archbishop Arnold II von Wied in 1151 and ending in 1227 . It is one of twelve great churches in Cologne that were built in the Romanesque style . St. Gereon has a highly irregular plan , the nave being covered by a decagonal oval dome , 21.0 m long and 16.9 m wide , completed in 1227 on the remains of Roman walls , which are still visible . It is the largest dome built in the West between the erection of the Hagia Sophia in the 6th century and the Duomo of Florence in the 15th century . Ernst Seifert built an organ there in 1898 . In the 20th century , the architect Andreas Dilthey worked on its interior . Archaeological excavation has revealed the presence of an earlier structure from the fourth century , possibly a funerary building that was converted into a church by the sixth century .

  "/wiki/Western_world": "The Western world , also known as the West , refers to various regions , nations and states , depending on the context , most often including at least parts of Europe , Australasia , and the Americas . There are many accepted definitions , all closely interrelated . The Western world is also known as the Occident ( from the Latin word occidens , sunset , West ) , in contrast to the Orient ( from the Latin word oriens , rise , East ) , or Eastern world . It might mean the Northern half of the North-South divide . Ancient Greece [ a ] and Ancient Rome [ b ] are generally considered to be the birthplaces of Western civilization - Greece having heavily influenced Rome - the former due to its impact on philosophy , democracy , science , aesthetics and art , building designs and proportions , architecture ; the latter due to its influence on law , warfare , governance , republicanism , engineering and religion . Western civilization is also strongly associated with Christianity , which is in turn shaped by Hellenistic philosophy , Judaism and Roman culture . In the modern era , Western culture has been heavily influenced by the Renaissance , the Ages of Discovery and Enlightenment and the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions . Through extensive imperialism , colonialism and Christianization by Western powers in the 15th to 20th centuries , and later exportation of mass culture , much of the rest of the world has been extensively influenced by Western culture , in a phenomenon often called Westernization . The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the theological , methodological and emphatical division between the Western Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches . West was originally literal , opposing Catholic Europe with the cultures and civilizations of Orthodox Europe , the Middle East and North Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , Southeast Asia and the remote Far East , which early-modern Europeans saw as the East . By the mid-20th century , Western culture was exported worldwide through the emergent mass media : film , radio , television and recorded music ; and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication ( such as transatlantic cable and the radiotelephone ) played a decisive role in modern globalization . In modern usage , Western world sometimes refers to Europe and to areas whose populations have had a large European ethnical presence since the 15th century Age of Discovery .",

Built in AD 537 in the Middle Ages , it was famous in particular for its massive dome . It was the world 's largest building and an engineering marvel of its time . It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have changed the history of architecture . The Hagia Sophia construction consists of mostly masonry . The structure is composed of brick and mortar joints that are 1.5 times the width of the bricks . The mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces displaced very evenly throughout the mortar joints . This combination of sand and ceramic pieces could be considered to be the equivalent of modern concrete at the time .

  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",
  "/wiki/Polygon": "In elementary geometry , a polygon ( /\u02c8p\u0252l\u026a\u0261\u0252n/ ) is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain or polygonal circuit . The solid plane region , the bounding circuit , or the two together , may be called a polygon . The segments of a polygonal circuit are called its edges or sides , and the points where two edges meet are the polygon 's vertices ( singular : vertex ) or corners . The interior of a solid polygon is sometimes called its body . An n-gon is a polygon with n sides ; for example , a triangle is a 3-gon . A simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself . Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly . A polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself , creating star polygons and other self-intersecting polygons . A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions . There are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes .",

  "/wiki/Pendentive": "In architecture , a pendentive is a constructional device permitting the placing of a circular dome over a square room or of an elliptical dome over a rectangular room . The pendentives , which are triangular segments of a sphere , taper to points at the bottom and spread at the top to establish the continuous circular or elliptical base needed for a dome . In masonry the pendentives thus receive the weight of the dome , concentrating it at the four corners where it can be received by the piers beneath . Prior to the pendentive 's development , builders used the device of corbelling or squinches in the corners of a room . Pendentives commonly occurred in Orthodox , Renaissance , and Baroque churches , with a drum with windows often inserted between the pendentives and the dome . The first experimentation with pendentives began with Roman dome construction in the 2nd-3rd century AD , while full development of the form came in the 6th-century Eastern Roman Hagia Sophia at Constantinople .",

  "/wiki/Tepidarium": "The tepidarium was the warm ( tepidus ) bathroom of the Roman baths heated by a hypocaust or underfloor heating system . The speciality of a tepidarium is the pleasant feeling of constant radiant heat which directly affects the human body from the walls and floor . There is an interesting example at Pompeii ; this was covered with a semicircular barrel vault , decorated with reliefs in stucco , and round the room a series of square recesses or niches divided from one another by Telamones . The tepidarium in the Roman thermae was the great central hall around which all the other halls were grouped , and which gave the key to the plans of the thermal . It was probably the hall where the bathers first assembled prior to passing through the various hot baths ( Caldaria ) or taking the cold bath ( Frigidarium ) . The tepidarium was decorated with the richest marbles and mosaics : it received its light through clerestory windows , on the sides , the front and the rear , and would seem to have been the hall in which the finest treasures of art were placed ; thus in the thermae of Caracalla , the Farnese Hercules , and the Toro Farnese , the two gladiators , the sarcophagi of green basalt now in the Vatican , and numerous other treasures , were found during the excavations by Paul III and transported to the Vatican and the museum at Naples ."
