  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

  "/wiki/Dicket_Mead": "The Welwyn Roman Baths are a Roman ruin preserved under the A1 ( M ) just north of modern-day Welwyn Garden City , Hertfordshire , England . The baths were a small part of the Dicket Mead villa , which was originally built in the 3rd century AD . The village of Welwyn has been described as being the site of a Romano-British settlement , where a Roman road crossed the river Mimram . There was another Roman villa near Welwyn on the Lockleys estate . The full extent of the Dicket Mead villa was never fully excavated prior to the construction of the motorway , but the baths were only one of at least four buildings in total . The complex was probably part of a farm . It has been speculated that it might have been at least in part the equivalent of a hotel , lying as it does near Roman roads . The ruins were uncovered in 1960 by local archaeologist Tony Rook , and the baths were gradually uncovered over the following 10 years by excavation . Shortly after the excavation was completed , the Ministry of Transport announced the route of a new motorway , straight over the top of the excavation . Eventually arrangements were made whereby a steel vault would be built over the top of the baths with an access tunnel for the public . Once the vault was completed the motorway was built over the top of it , and the remains of the baths sit 9 metres below junction 6 . Only about half of the original extent of the baths is now on display .",
