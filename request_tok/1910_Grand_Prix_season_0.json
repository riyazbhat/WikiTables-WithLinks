  "/wiki/Formula_Libre": "Formula Libre ( also known as Formule Libre ) is a form of automobile racing allowing a wide variety of types , ages and makes of purpose-built racing cars to compete head to head . This can make for some interesting matchups , and provides the opportunity for some compelling driving performances against superior machinery . The name translates to Free Formula - in Formula Libre races the only regulations typically govern basics such as safety equipment . In 1932 , Louis Chiron won the Nice Grand Prix aboard a Bugatti T51 , closely followed just 3.4 seconds behind by Raymond Sommer in an Alfa Romeo Monza with third place going to Ren\u00e9 Dreyfus , also in a Bugatti T51 . In 1933 , the race was won by Tazio Nuvolari in a Maserati 8C , followed by Ren\u00e9 Dreyfus in his Bugatti and Guy Moll in an Alfa Romeo Monza . In 1934 , the race was again won by an Italian in an Alfa Romeo Tipo B , none other than the best driver of the season , Achille Varzi . The last season to feature a Grand Prix at Nice was in 1935 , when the Alfa Romeo Tipo Bs dominated the circuit in the hands of Tazio Nuvolari and Louis Chiron , who placed second , and Ren\u00e9 Dreyfus , who took third . Most recently , the British Open Single Seaters ( BOSS ) Formula has spawned EuroBOSS and USBOSS equivalents , signalling the re-emergence of Formula Libre events . Racing purists have come to embrace Formula Libre as an alternative to the increasing preponderance of spec racing series , and a number of competitors ' vehicles are cars orphaned by discontinued spec series . Formula Libre has provided some ambitious young drivers with an alternative to series with higher competitive costs and lower performance . Most recently , the UK 's British Racing Drivers ' Club ( BRDC ) awarded their Rising Star award to 2004 EuroBOSS Champion Scott Mansell . The concept is arguably the oldest in motor racing :",
