Set against a backdrop of serial murders from 1974 to 1983 , including the Yorkshire Ripper killings , the books and films follow several recurring fictional characters through a bleak and violent world of multi-layered police corruption and organised crime . Although there are allusions to real-life crimes , the plot is fictional rather than a documentary or factual account of events . Both the books and films mix elements of fact , fiction , and conspiracy theory - a confection dubbed Yorkshire Noir by some critics - and are notable for a chronologically fractured narrative and for defying neat or trite endings and resolutions . The name of the series is a reference to the murders and to their location , the historic county of Yorkshire being traditionally divided into three areas known as ridings",
  "/wiki/Macbeth": "Macbeth ( /m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8/ ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare ; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606 . [ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play",
