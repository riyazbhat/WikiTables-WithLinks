It is the seat of \u00d6stersund Municipality and the capital of J\u00e4mtland County . \u00d6stersund is located at the shores of Sweden 's fifth largest lake , Storsj\u00f6n , opposite the island Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n , and is the only city in J\u00e4mtland . \u00d6stersund is the region 's cultural and economical centre and by tradition a city of trade and commerce . \u00d6stersund had one of the most extensive garrisons in Sweden prior to its closure in the early-21st century . The city is the Mid Sweden University 's largest campus site with approximately 7,000 students . With a total population of 50,960 ( 2017 ) \u00d6stersund is the 22nd most populous city in Sweden , the 46th most populous city in Scandinavia , and by far the largest inland city in Northern Sweden . The city was the only Swedish city founded and chartered in the 18th century . \u00d6stersund was founded in order to create a trade monopoly over J\u00e4mtland whose inhabitants ' lucrative trade annoyed the Swedish crown . The intention was to persuade the local farmers to deliver merchandise to middlemen in \u00d6stersund , but the population opposed this economic philosophy , and \u00d6stersund long remained small . It took until the end of the 19th century for \u00d6stersund to truly become a city , after the arrival of the railroad and the economic liberalization of that time . \u00d6stersund is situated in inland Scandinavia and connected to Sundsvall in the east on the Swedish coast , and Trondheim in the west at the shores of the Norwegian sea",
