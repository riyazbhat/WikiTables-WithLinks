  "/wiki/CMLL_World_Heavyweight_Championship": "The CMLL World Heavyweight Championship ( Spanish : Campeonato Mundial de Peso Completo del CMLL ) is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship established in 1991 and promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) . CMLL introduced the championship to signal their independence from the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) , whose titles they had continued to promote after leaving the alliance in the late 1980s . As part of the move away from the NWA , CMLL established championships designated as CMLL World Championships for several weight divisions . The Heavyweight Championship was the first CMLL title to be created , and the inaugural champion was Konnan el B\u00e1rbaro , who won the title on June 9 , 1991 . The current champion is \u00daltimo Guerrero , who is in his second reign . He defeated Diamante Azul in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant title on October 16 , 2018 . Sixteen different wrestlers have held the championship , split over twenty separate championship reigns . In most professional wrestling promotions around the world , the world heavyweight designation is used to indicate the highest-ranking championship instead of an actual weight division . Traditionally , however , lucha libre has used multiple weight divisions , often with the lower weight classes receiving more attention from the promoters . CMLL carries on this tradition . As it is a professional wrestling championship , it is won not by actual competition , but by a scripted ending to a match . [ b ]",

The title is awarded to the chosen team after they win a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport . The first champions were Los Infernales ( The Infernal Ones ; MS-1 , Pirata Morgan and El Sat\u00e1nico ) who won a tournament on November 22 , 1991 . Since then a total of 26 different trios have held the championship . The current champions are Los Guerreros Laguneros ( Euforia , Gran Guerrero and \u00daltimo Guerrero ) after having defeated the previous champions The Cl4n ( Ciber the Main Man , The Chris and Sharlie Rockstar ) on September 14 , 2018 . The championship has been vacated on four different occasions , each time leading to CMLL holding a tournament to determine new champions . Only two teams have held the title on more than one occasion , Los Infernales and the trio of H\u00e9ctor Garza , Hijo del Fantasma and La M\u00e1scara .",
