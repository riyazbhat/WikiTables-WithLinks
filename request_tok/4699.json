  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina": "Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record , tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 , causing $ 125 billion in damage , particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas , and over 1,200 deaths . The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States , behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . Katrina originated on August 23 , 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80 % of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 .

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops .

They are believed to be descended from the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures , who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries . About 1,700 years ago , the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya , a great earthwork mound in what is present-day central Mississippi . It is still considered sacred by the Choctaw , who regained control of the site in 2008 . The anthropologist John Reed Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader . Henry Halbert , a historian , suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase Hacha hatak ( river people ) . The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century in the Southeast encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs . The Choctaw coalesced as a people in the 17th century , and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions : eastern , western and southern . These groups sometimes formed distinct , independent alliances with European powers , including the French , based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana Territory ; the English of the Southeast ; and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era . During the American Revolution , most Choctaw supported the Thirteen Colonies ' bid for independence from the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Grand_Village_of_the_Natchez": "Grand Village of the Natchez , ( 22 AD 501 ) also known as the Fatherland Site , is a 128.1-acre ( 0.518 km2 ) site encompassing a prehistoric indigenous village and earthwork mounds in present-day south Natchez , Mississippi . The village complex was constructed starting about 1200 CE by members of the prehistoric Plaquemine culture . They built the three platform mounds in stages . Another phase of significant construction work by these prehistoric people has been dated to the mid-15th century . It was named for the historic Natchez people , who used the site in the 17th and 18th centuries . In the early 18th century , when the historic Natchez people occupied the site , they added to the mounds . The village was the Natchez tribe 's main political and religious ceremonial center in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , according to historical and archaeological evidence . It replaced the Emerald Mound Site in this role . After suffering a 1730 military defeat by French settlers , the Natchez abandoned the site and moved away . In the early 19th century , the land was privately owned and cultivated as part of the Fatherland Plantation . Archaeological excavations started in 1930 , and three mounds were found . ( They had been partially buried by loess soils , with some erosion due to St. Catherine 's Creek . )",
  "/wiki/Natchez_people": "The Natchez ( /\u02c8n\u00e6t\u0283\u0259z/ ; Natchez pronunciation [ na\u02d0\u0283t\u0361seh ] ) are a Native American people who originally lived in the Natchez Bluffs area in the Lower Mississippi Valley , near the present-day city of Natchez , Mississippi in the United States . They spoke a language with no known close relatives , although it may be very distantly related to the Muskogean languages of the Creek Confederacy . The Natchez are noted for being the only Mississippian culture with complex chiefdom characteristics to have survived long into the period after the European colonization of America began . Others had generally declined a century or two before European encounter . The Natchez are also noted for having had an unusual social system of nobility classes and exogamous marriage practices . It was a strongly matrilineal kinship society , with descent reckoned along female lines . The paramount chief named the Great Sun was always the son of the Female Sun , whose daughter would be the mother of the next Great Sun . This ensured that the chiefdom stayed under the control of the single Sun lineage . Ethnologists have not reached consensus on how the Natchez social system originally functioned , and the topic is somewhat controversial . Around 1730 , after several wars with the French , the Natchez were defeated and dispersed . Most survivors were sold by the French into slavery in the West Indies ; others took refuge with other tribes , such as the Muskogean Chickasaw and Creek , and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee . Today , most Natchez families and communities are found in Oklahoma , where Natchez members are enrolled in the federally recognized Cherokee and Muscogee ( Creek ) nations in Oklahoma .",

  "/wiki/Paleo-Indian": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",

The Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies supported through the exploitation of nuts , seeds , and shellfish . As its ending is defined by the adoption of sedentary farming , this date can vary significantly across the Americas . The rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period .",
