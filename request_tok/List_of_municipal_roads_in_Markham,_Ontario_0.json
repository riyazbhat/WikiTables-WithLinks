  "/wiki/John_Street_(Markham)": "John Street is an east-west collector and arterial road in the city of Markham , Ontario , Canada . It is one of the oldest roads in the city of Markham and forms the backbone of the 200-year-old community of Thornhill . The street originally ran east from Yonge Street across a tributary of the Don River , at which point it branched north to what is now Leslie Street and south on German Mills Road . This was a travelled road which did not match the alignment of any concession road or lot line and was constructed along the most convenient route to farms and mills to serve the needs of the inhabitants at that time . In the late 20th century an extension was made across Highway 404 and through an industrial area to connect to Woodbine Avenue , east of which it joins with Esna Park Drive . John Street has had a major impact in shaping the community ; the parallel Green Lane/14th Avenue east-west road allowance has never been fully opened and Leslie Street still diverts from the route laid out by the township survey to join Don Mills Road near the former easterly end of John Street .",

  "/wiki/Highway_7_(Ontario)": "King 's Highway 7 , commonly referred to as Highway 7 and The 7 historically as the Northern Highway , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . At its peak , Highway 7 measured 716 km ( 445 mi ) in length , stretching from Highway 40 east of Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario to Highway 17 west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario . However , due in part to the construction of Highways 402 and 407 , the province transferred the sections of Highway 7 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction . The highway is now 535.7 km ( 332.9 mi ) long ; the western segment begins at Highway 4 north of London and extends 154.1 km ( 95.8 mi ) to Georgetown , while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends 381.6 km ( 237.1 mi ) to Highway 417 in Ottawa . Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year . Between 1927 and 1932 , the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth , where Highway 15 continued to Ottawa . In the early 1960s , that section of Highway 15 was renumbered as Highway 7 . In that same decade , the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed . During the 1970s and 1980s , many sections of Highway 7 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes . Within York Region , the route was upgraded to a limited-access expressway in preparation for the construction of Highway 407 . Soon thereafter , that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway 7 through the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) to regional governments . In the west , the construction of Highway 402 between Sarnia and London provided an uninterrupted alternative to Highway 7 , resulting in the transfer of the section west of Highway 4 .",

The route is generally rural and straight , passing near several communities within the Regional Municipality of York . The route is 65.2 kilometres ( 40.5 mi ) long . Most part of the road has a speed limit of 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) , except within town limits , where the speed limit is reduced to 60 km/h ( 37 mph ) or 50 km/h ( 31 mph ) . Highway 48 was first designated in 1937 to connect Port Bolster with Highway 12 in Beaverton . It was extended south to meet with Highway 401 in the 1950s in anticipation of a planned freeway connection around the eastern shore of Lake Simcoe that ultimately became Highway 404 . In the mid-1970s , Highway 48 assumed a portion of the route of Highway 46 in Victoria Country , now the city of Kawartha Lakes , extending the route to Highway 35 in Coboconk . Between then and 1998 , the route was 128 km ( 80 mi ) .

A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line . In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham , the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to the north and east are part of the protected Rouge National Urban Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport . Construction of the route began in 2002 north of 16th Avenue . In 2004 , an interchange with Highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to Highway 7 . Both segments and the interchange were opened by December of that year . The following year , construction began to connect these two segments as well as on the Box Grove Bypass along Ninth Line ; the former opened in October 2006 and the latter in the spring of 2007 . Construction of the most recently opened segment , connecting the Box Grove Bypass to the interchange with Highway 407 , began in 2009 . It opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue .
