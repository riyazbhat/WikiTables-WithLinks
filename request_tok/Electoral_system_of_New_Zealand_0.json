  "/wiki/New_Zealand_National_Party": "The New Zealand National Party ( M\u0101ori : R\u014dp\u016b N\u0101hinara o Aotearoa ) , shortened to National ( N\u0101hinara ) or the Nats , is a centre-right political party in New Zealand . It is one of two major parties that dominate contemporary New Zealand politics , alongside its traditional rival , the New Zealand Labour Party . National was formed in 1936 through amalgamation of conservative and liberal parties , Reform and United respectively , and is New Zealand 's second-oldest extant political party . National 's predecessors had previously formed a coalition against the growing labour movement . National governed for five periods during the 20th and 21st centuries , and has spent more time in government than any other party . After the 1949 general election , Sidney Holland became the first prime minister from the National Party , and remained in office until 1957 . He was succeeded by Keith Holyoake , who was soon defeated at a general election by the Labour Party in 1957 . Holyoake was in office for a second period from 1960 to 1972 . The party 's platform shifted from moderate economic liberalism to increased emphasis on state interventionism during Robert Muldoon 's National government from 1975 to 1984 . In 1990 , Jim Bolger formed another National government , which continued the radical free-market reforms initiated by the preceding Labour government . The party has since advocated free enterprise , reduction of taxes and limited state regulation . Following the first MMP election in 1996 , the National Party governed in a coalition with the populist New Zealand First .",
