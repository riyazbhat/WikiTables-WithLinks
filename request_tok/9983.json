However , the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it , and by the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the TBD was already outdated . The Devastator performed well in some early battles , but earned notoriety for its catastrophically poor performance in the Battle of Midway , in which the 41 Devastators launched during the battle produced zero torpedo hits and only six survived to return to their carriers . Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the Mitsubishi Zero fighters they faced , most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the much more capable ( and survivable ) SBD Dauntless dive bombers that eventually sank four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser . Although a sizeable portion of the Devastator 's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US Mark 13 torpedo , the aircraft was immediately withdrawn from frontline service after Midway , being replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Midway": "The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4-7 June 1942 , six months after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea . The United States Navy under Admirals Chester W. Nimitz , Frank J. Fletcher , and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto , Ch\u016bichi Nagumo , and Nobutake Kond\u014d near Midway Atoll , inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable . Military historian John Keegan called it the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare , while naval historian Craig Symonds called it one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history , ranking alongside Salamis , Trafalgar , and Tsushima Strait , as both tactically decisive and strategically influential . The Japanese operation , like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor , sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific , thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific . Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall barrier strategy to extend Japan 's defensive perimeter , in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo . This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji , Samoa , and Hawaii itself . The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly , American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack , enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush . Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle . The four Japanese fleet carriers - Akagi , Kaga , S\u014dry\u016b and Hiry\u016b , part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier - were sunk , as was the heavy cruiser Mikuma .

  "/wiki/Professor_Emeritus": "Emeritus ( male ) /Emerita ( female ) ( /\u0259\u02c8m\u025br\u026at\u0259s/ ) , [ Note 1 ] in its current usage , is an adjective used to designate a retired chairperson , professor , pastor , bishop , pope , director , president , prime minister , rabbi , emperor , or other person who has been permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last office held . Like the Romance languages derived from it , Latin contains many words that are gender-specific ; emeritus is used for a male , emerita for a female . In some cases , the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank , but in others , it remains a mark of distinguished service , awarded only to a few on retirement . It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position , enabling their former rank to be retained in their title , e.g. , professor emeritus . The term emeritus does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position , and they may continue to exercise some of them .",
  "/wiki/History_of_post-Soviet_Russia": "The history of Russia from 1991 to the present began with the dissolution of the Soviet Union ( USSR ) on 26 December 1991 . The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) was the largest republic within the USSR , but until 1990 it had no significant independence . The Russian Federation was the largest of the fifteen republics that made up the USSR , accounting for over 60 % of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) and over 50 % of the Soviet population . Russians also dominated the Soviet military and the Communist Party ( CPSU ) . As such , the Russian Federation was widely accepted as the USSR 's successor state in diplomatic affairs and it assumed the USSR 's permanent membership and veto in the UN Security Council ( see Russia and the United Nations ) . Prior to the dissolution of the USSR , Boris Yeltsin had been elected President of Russia in June 1991 in the first direct presidential election in Russian history . This ensured that Yeltsin would be the political leader of the Russian successor state following dissolution . This situation resulted in political turmoil as the Soviet and Russian leadership wrestled for control , which culminated in the 1991 August coup , where the Soviet military attempted to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev . Although the coup was ultimately averted , this situation contributed to rising instability in the Soviet Union . As the USSR was on the verge of collapse by October 1991 , Yeltsin announced that Russia would proceed with radical reforms , including market-oriented reform along the lines of Poland 's big bang , also known as shock therapy . For the most part , the Russian armed forces were in near complete disarray by 1992 , one year after dissolution . This degraded military effectiveness would become all too clear during the 1994 Chechen War , but in the interim this posed some significant practical challenges for global security and arms control .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Europe": "Eastern Europe is the eastern part of the European continent . There is no consistent definition of the precise area it covers , partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical , geographical , cultural , and socioeconomic connotations . There are almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region . A related United Nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct . One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural entity : the region lying in Europe with the main characteristics consisting of Greek , Byzantine , Eastern Orthodox , Russian , and some Ottoman cultural influences . Another definition was created during the Cold War and used more or less synonymously with the term Eastern Bloc . A similar definition names the formerly communist European states outside the Soviet Union as Eastern Europe . Most historians and social scientists view such definitions as outdated or relegated , but they are still sometimes used for statistical purposes .",

At the time there were multiple media reports suggesting the rationale for the forced retirements of both the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff was actually disagreements between the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense on the path of Air Force budgets , modernization and recapitalization . Specifically , that General Moseley continued to aggressively support the full procurement of the F-22 , larger numbers of the F-35 , Next-Generation Bomber , enhanced unmanned aerial vehicles , a new tanker aircraft , a new combat search and rescue helicopter , an upgrade of Department of Defense space systems , an operational focus on cyberwarfare capability and the beginning of nuclear systems modernization .
