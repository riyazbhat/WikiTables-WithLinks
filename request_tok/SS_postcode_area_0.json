  "/wiki/PO_Box": "A post office box ( commonly abbreviated as P.O . box , or also known as a postal box ) is a uniquely addressable lockable box located on the premises of a post office station . In some regions , particularly in Africa , there is no door to door delivery of mail ; for example , in Kenya . Consequently , renting a PO box has traditionally been the only way to receive mail in such countries . However , some countries , like Egypt , have introduced mail home delivery . Generally , post office boxes are rented from the post office either by individuals or by businesses on a basis ranging from monthly to annual , and the cost of rent varies depending on the box size . Central business district ( CBD ) PO boxes are usually more expensive than rural PO boxes . In the United States , the rental rate used to be [ when ? ] uniform across the country . Now , however , a postal facility can be in any of seven fee groups by location ; in addition , certain customers qualify for free box rental , usually because the Postal Service does not offer carrier-route delivery to their physical addresses . In the United Kingdom , Royal Mail PO boxes are often little more than pigeon-holes in the secure section of a sorting office and are accessible only by staff . In such cases , the renter of the PO box will be issued with a card showing the PO box number and delivery office name and must produce this to the desk staff when collecting mail .",

A full postcode is known as a postcode unit and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point . The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes , the first having between two and four characters and the second , three characters . First , one or two letters indicate the postcode area , followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area . This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district , and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street . Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city ( such as B for Birmingham ) but may also be geographic in nature ( such as HS for Outer Hebrides ) . Each postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one ( or more ) postcode districts .

It is administered and collected by HM Revenue and Customs , primarily through the Value Added Tax Act 1994 . VAT is levied on most goods and services provided by registered businesses in the UK and some goods and services imported from outside the European Union . There are complex regulations for goods and services imported from within the EU . The default VAT rate is the standard rate , 20% since 4 January 2011 . Some goods and services are subject to VAT at a reduced rate of 5% ( such as domestic fuel ) or 0% ( such as most food and children 's clothing ) . Others are exempt from VAT or outside the system altogether . Under EU law , the standard rate of VAT in any EU state can not be lower than 15% . Each state may have up to two reduced rates of at least 5% for a restricted list of goods and services . The European Council must approve any temporary reduction of VAT in the public interest . VAT is an indirect tax because the tax is paid to the government by the seller ( the business ) rather than the person who ultimately bears the economic burden of the tax ( the consumer ) . Opponents of VAT claim it is a regressive tax because the poorest people spend a higher proportion of their disposable income on VAT than the richest people .",
