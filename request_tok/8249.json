  "/wiki/I_Dreamed_a_Dream": "I Dreamed a Dream is a song from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables . It is a solo that is sung by the character Fantine during the first act . The music is by Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg , with orchestrations by John Cameron . The English lyrics are by Herbert Kretzmer , based on the original French libretto by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel from the original French production . The song is a lament , sung by the anguished Fantine , who has just been fired from her job at the factory and thrown onto the streets . She thinks back to happier days and wonders at all that has gone wrong in her life . The song is typically played in the key of E-flat major with the final chorus in F major , though the pitch is shifted up a bit for high-toned TVs , and it has also become a jazz standard . In the 1985 musical , the song occurs after Fantine has been fired , and before Lovely Ladies . In the original French production and the 2012 film adaptation , these two musical numbers are swapped around , to place dramatic emphasis on Fantine 's depressing descent into prostitution . The original French song was very extensively rewritten for the English production by Herbert Kretzmer , adding the prologue ( There was a time ... ) and cutting the last few lines which became the ending to Lovely Ladies ( 'Do n't they know they 're making love to one already dead ' ) . For the French revival in 1991 , the song was loosely translated back from the English version ; there are thus two very different French versions of the song .",

  "/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby": "The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval and excess , creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary [ a ] tale regarding the American Dream . Fitzgerald - inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's North Shore - began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue . First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly . In its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World War II , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel .",
