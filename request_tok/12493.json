The city , located in northern China , is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the central government with 16 urban , suburban , and rural districts . Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast ; together , the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China . Beijing is an important world capital and global power city , and one of the world 's leading centers for culture , diplomacy and politics , business and economy , education , language , and science and technology . A megacity , Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation 's cultural , educational , and political center . It is home to the headquarters of most of China 's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world , as well as the world 's four biggest financial institutions . It is also a major hub for the national highway , expressway , railway , and high-speed rail networks . The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010 , and , as of 2016 [ update ] , the city 's subway network is the busiest and longest in the world . Combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world , with a rich history dating back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries , and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium AD . Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica notes that few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural center of an area as immense as China . With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital .",

Yang Yang ( A ) crossed the line together with Chun in what was ruled and reviewed as a photo finish , but was then disqualified for cross tracking Chun at the very end as Chun tried to pass on the inside ( although the photo finish seemed to show Chun having defeated her for the gold regardless ) .

The town has a population of about 80,000 and is the seat of the wider Borough of Guildford which had an estimated 146,100 inhabitants in 2015 .

[ n 1 ] By AD 978 it was home to an early English Royal Mint . The building of the Wey Navigation and the Basingstoke Canal in the 17th and 18th centuries , respectively , connected Guildford to a network of waterways that aided its prosperity .

  "/wiki/Wang_Chunlu": "Wang Chunlu ( born 27 September 1978 in Changchun , China ) is a Chinese short track speed skater . She won medals in the 500 m and 3000 m relay at the 2002 Winter Olympics . She had also already won a relay silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics , at the age of 19 . Her strongest event by far was always the 500 metres , where she won 3 world titles- 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 . In addition to her Olympic bronze in 2002 , she was also leading the final and on her way to a likely gold medal in 1998 before a dangerous and poorly executed passing attempt by Isabelle Charest unfortunately led to Charest and Wang both falling . Distraught Wang , despite not being injured , refused to complete her 5 laps , and ceded the bronze medal to Chun Lee Kyung , the winner of the B final . Her strong start and strength on high speed corners are what made the 500 metres Wang 's strongest event . Surprisingly her best major meet performance was at the 1995 World Championships at only 16 , where as a relative newcomer she won gold in the 500 meters and 1000 metres , and a bronze in the 1500 metres . Despite this she was narrowly defeated for the Overall points title by Chun Lee Kyung , taking silver overall . She also won silver overall at the 2001 World Championships , and a bronze overall at the 1998 World Championships . She competed in what is perhaps still to this day the strongest era ever in Chinese short track speed skating from 94-2002 due to its depth of established stars such as Wang , both Yang Yang 's ( the one born in 1976 and the one born in 1977 ) , Zhang Yanmei , and Li Yan .",
