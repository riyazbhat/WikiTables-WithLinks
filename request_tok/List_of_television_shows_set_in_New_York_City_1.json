  "/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tracy": "The Trouble with Tracy is a Canadian television series produced by CTV for the 1970-1971 television season , with intended distribution by the U.S.-based National General Pictures . It is considered by some to be one of the worst situation comedies ever produced . The series was produced as a daily show , and aired weekday afternoons at 3:30 pm from September 14 , 1970 .

Even flubbed lines and bloopers sometimes ended up airing , because the show could not afford retakes",
