  "/wiki/Physicist": "A physicist is a scientist who specializes in the field of physics , which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe . Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena , and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms . Physicists work across a wide range of research fields , spanning all length scales : from sub-atomic and particle physics , through biological physics , to cosmological length scales encompassing the universe as a whole . The field generally includes two types of physicists : experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of physical phenomena and the analysis of experiments , and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize , explain and predict natural phenomena . Physicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies ( also known as applied physics or engineering physics ) .",

The will of the Swedish chemist , engineer and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895 . The prizes in Chemistry , Literature , Peace , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901 . The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields . In 1968 , Sveriges Riksbank , Sweden 's central bank , established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel . The award is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the bank 's 300th anniversary . The first Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen in 1969 . The Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , Stockholm , Sweden , according to the same principles as for the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded since 1901 .

  "/wiki/Speed_of_light": "The speed of light in vacuum , commonly denoted c , is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics . Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second ( approximately 300000 km/s ( 186000 mi/s ) [ Note 3 ] ) . It is exact because by international agreement a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of \u200b1\u2044299792458 second . [ Note 4 ] According to special relativity , c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter and information can travel . Though this speed is most commonly associated with light , it is also the speed at which all massless particles and field perturbations travel in vacuum , including electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves . Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer . Particles with nonzero rest mass can approach c , but can never actually reach it . In the special and general theories of relativity , c interrelates space and time , and also appears in the famous equation of mass-energy equivalence E = mc2 . The speed at which light propagates through transparent materials , such as glass or air , is less than c ; similarly , the speed of electromagnetic waves in wire cables is slower than c. The ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material ( n = c / v ) . For example , for visible light the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5 , meaning that light in glass travels at c / 1.5 \u2248 200000 km/s ( 124000 mi/s ) ; the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1.0003 , so the speed of light in air is about 299700 km/s ( 186220 mi/s ) , which is about 90 km/s ( 56 mi/s ) slower than c. For many practical purposes , light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously , but for long distances and very sensitive measurements , their finite speed has noticeable effects . In communicating with distant space probes , it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft , or vice versa . The light seen from stars left them many years ago , allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects .",
  "/wiki/Michelson\u2013Morley_experiment": "The Michelson-Morley experiment was an attempt to detect the existence of aether , a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves . The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and published in November of the same year . It compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions , in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether ( aether wind ) . The result was negative , in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether , and the speed at right angles . This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory , and initiated a line of research that eventually led to special relativity , which rules out a stationary aether . [ A 1 ] Of this experiment , Einstein wrote , If the Michelson-Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment , no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a ( halfway ) redemption . [ A 2 ] :219 Michelson-Morley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity . These include experiments from 1902 to 1905 , and a series of experiments in the 1920s . More recent optical resonator experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10\u221217 level . Together with the Ives-Stilwell and Kennedy-Thorndike experiments , Michelson-Morley type experiments form one of the fundamental tests of special relativity theory . [ A 3 ]",

He became known as the Father of Electric Traction .",
  "/wiki/Electric_traction": "A railway electrification system supplies electric power to railway trains and trams without an on-board prime mover or local fuel supply . Electric railways use either electric locomotives ( hauling passengers or freight in separate cars ) or electric multiple units ( passenger cars with their own motors ) . Electricity is typically generated in large and relatively efficient generating stations , transmitted to the railway network and distributed to the trains . Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and transmission lines , but most purchase power from an electric utility . The railway usually provides its own distribution lines , switches , and transformers . Power is supplied to moving trains with a ( nearly ) continuous conductor running along the track that usually takes one of two forms : an overhead line , suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings , or a third rail mounted at track level and contacted by a sliding pickup shoe . Both overhead wire and third-rail systems usually use the running rails as the return conductor , but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose . In comparison to the principal alternative , the diesel engine , electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency , lower emissions , and lower operating costs . Electric locomotives are also usually quieter , more powerful , and more responsive and reliable than diesels . They have no local emissions , an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas . Some electric traction systems provide regenerative braking that turns the train 's kinetic energy back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid . While diesel locomotives burn petroleum , electricity can be generated from diverse sources , including renewable energy .",

  "/wiki/Nitrocellulose": "Nitrocellulose ( also known as cellulose nitrate , flash paper , flash cotton , guncotton , and flash string ) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to nitric acid or another powerful nitrating agent . When used as a propellant or low-order explosive , it was originally known as guncotton . Partially nitrated cellulose has found uses as a plastic film and in inks and wood coatings . In 1855 , the first man-made plastic , nitrocellulose ( branded Parkesine , patented in 1862 ) , was created by Alexander Parkes from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent . In 1868 , American inventor John Wesley Hyatt developed a plastic material he named Celluloid , improving on Parkes ' invention by plasticizing the nitrocellulose with camphor so it could be processed into finished form and used as a photographic film . Celluloid was used by Kodak , and other suppliers , from the late 1880s as a film base in photography , X-ray films , and motion-picture films , and was commonly known as nitrate film . After numerous fires caused by unstable nitrate films , safety film ( cellulose acetate film ) started to be used from the 1930s in the case of X-ray stock and from 1948 for motion-picture film .",

  "/wiki/Maser": "A maser ( /\u02c8me\u026az\u0259r/ , an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification by stimulated emission . The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes , James P. Gordon , and Herbert J. Zeiger at Columbia University in 1953 . Townes , Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser . Masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks , and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations . Modern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies . For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing microwave with the word molecular as the first word in the acronym maser . The laser works by the same principle as the maser , but produces higher frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths . The maser was the forerunner of the laser , inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman . When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957 , it was originally called the optical maser . This was ultimately changed to laser for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation . Gordon Gould is credited with creating this acronym in 1957 .",
  "/wiki/Laser": "A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation . The term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories , based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow . A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent . Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot , enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography . Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ( collimation ) , enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar . Lasers can also have high temporal coherence , which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum , i.e. , they can emit a single color of light . Alternatively , temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond ( ultrashort pulses ) . Lasers are used in optical disk drives , laser printers , barcode scanners , DNA sequencing instruments , fiber-optic , semiconducting chip manufacturing ( photolithography ) , and free-space optical communication , laser surgery and skin treatments , cutting and welding materials , military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed , and in laser lighting displays for entertainment .

  "/wiki/Gravitational_wave": "Gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime , generated by accelerated masses , that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light . They were proposed by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1905 and subsequently predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein on the basis of his general theory of relativity . Gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation , a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation . Newton 's law of universal gravitation , part of classical mechanics , does not provide for their existence , since that law is predicated on the assumption that physical interactions propagate instantaneously ( at infinite speed ) - showing one of the ways the methods of classical physics are unable to explain phenomena associated with relativity . Gravitational-wave astronomy is a branch of observational astronomy that uses gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as binary star systems composed of white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes ; and events such as supernovae , and the formation of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang . In 1993 , Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor , Jr. received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and observation of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar , which offered the first indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational waves . On 11 February 2016 , the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaboration announced they had made the first direct observation of gravitational waves . The observation was made five months earlier , on 14 September 2015 , using the Advanced LIGO detectors . The gravitational waves originated from the merging of a binary black hole system . After the initial announcement the LIGO instruments detected two more confirmed , and one potential , gravitational wave events . In August 2017 , the two LIGO instruments and the Virgo instrument observed a fourth gravitational wave from merging black holes , and a fifth gravitational wave from a binary neutron star merger . Several other gravitational wave detectors are planned or under construction .",

  "/wiki/Bathyscaphe": "A bathyscaphe ( /\u02c8b\u00e6\u03b8\u026aske\u026af/ or /\u02c8b\u00e6\u03b8\u026ask\u00e6f/ ) is a free-diving self-propelled deep-sea submersible , consisting of a crew cabin similar to a bathysphere , but suspended below a float rather than from a surface cable , as in the classic bathysphere design . The float is filled with gasoline because it is readily available , buoyant , and , for all practical purposes , incompressible . The incompressibility of the gasoline means the tanks can be very lightly constructed , since the pressure inside and outside the tanks equalises , eliminating any differential . By contrast , the crew cabin must withstand a huge pressure differential and is massively built . Buoyancy at the surface can be trimmed easily by replacing gasoline with water , which is denser . Auguste Piccard , inventor of the first bathyscaphe , composed the name bathyscaphe using the Ancient Greek words \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2 bathys ( deep ) and \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 skaphos ( vessel/ship ) .",
  "/wiki/Bathyscaphe_Trieste": "Trieste is a Swiss-designed , Italian-built deep-diving research bathyscaphe which reached a record depth of about 10,911 metres ( 35,797 ft ) in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench near Guam in the Pacific . On 23 January 1960 , Jacques Piccard ( son of the boat 's designer Auguste Piccard ) and US Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh achieved the goal of Project Nekton . It was the first manned vessel to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep .",
  "/wiki/Alan_Hale_(astronomer)": "Alan Hale ( born 1958 ) is an American professional astronomer , who co-discovered Comet Hale-Bopp along with amateur astronomer Thomas Bopp . Hale specializes in the study of sun-like stars and the search for extra-solar planetary systems , and has side interests in the fields of comets and near-Earth asteroids . He has been an active astronomer most of his life and currently serves as the president of the Earthrise Institute , which he founded , and which has as its mission the use of astronomy as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) has named an asteroid in Hale 's honor , 4151 Alanhale , in recognition of his numerous comet observations .",
  "/wiki/Comet_Hale\u2013Bopp": "Comet Hale-Bopp ( formally designated C/1995 O1 ) is a comet that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century and one of the brightest seen for many decades . Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp discovered Comet Hale-Bopp separately on July 23 , 1995 before it became visible to the naked eye . It is difficult to predict the maximum brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty , but Hale-Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1 , 1997 . It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months , twice as long as the Great Comet of 1811 , the previous record holder . Accordingly , Hale-Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997 ."
