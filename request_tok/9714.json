The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/British_Museum": "The British Museum , in the Bloomsbury area of London , United Kingdom , is a public institution dedicated to human history , art and culture . Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",

  "/wiki/Commius": "Commius ( Commios , Comius , Comnios ) was a king of the Belgic nation of the Atrebates , initially in Gaul , then in Britain , in the 1st century BC .",
  "/wiki/Tincomarus": "Tincomarus ( a dithematic name form typical of insular and continental Celtic onomastics , analysable as tinco- , perhaps a sort of fish [ cf Latin tinca , English tench ] + maro- , big ) was a king of the Iron Age Belgic tribe of the Atrebates who lived in southern central Britain shortly before the Roman invasion . His name was previously reconstructed as Tincommius , based on abbreviated coin legends and a damaged mention in Augustus 's Res Gestae , but since 1996 coins have been discovered which give his full name . He was the son and heir of Commius and succeeded his father around 25-20 BC . Based on coin distribution it is possible that Tincomarus ruled in collaboration with his father for the last few years of Commius 's life . Little is known of his reign although numismatic evidence suggests that he was more sympathetic to Rome than his father was in later years : the coins he issued much more closely resemble Roman types , and are so much better made that they must have come from professional Roman die-cutters . GC Boon has suggested that this technical advance was not limited to coinage and represents wider industrial assistance from the Roman Empire . Tincomarus 's successors used the term rex on their coins and this indicates that Tincomarus had begun the process of achieving client kingdom status with Rome ( see Roman client kingdoms in Britain ) . John Creighton argues , based on the imagery used on his coins , that Tincomarus may have been brought up as an obses ( diplomatic hostage ) in Rome in the early years of Augustus 's reign . He compares Tincomarus 's coins to those of Juba II of Numidia , who is known to have been an obses , and identifies a coin found in Numidia which may bear the name of Tincomarus 's younger brother Verica . By 16 BC Roman pottery and other imports appear in considerable quantities at Tincomarus 's capital of Calleva Atrebatum , today known as Silchester , and it is likely that the Atrebatic king had established trading and diplomatic links with Augustus . Tincomarus was expelled by his subjects for unknown reasons around AD 8 and fled to Rome as a refugee and supplicant . He was replaced by his brother Eppillus whom Augustus chose to recognise as rex rather than depose and reinstate Tincomarus .",
  "/wiki/Eppillus": "Eppillus ( Celtic : little horse ) was the name of a Roman client king of the Atrebates tribe of the British Iron Age . He appears to have ruled part of the territory that had previously been held by Commius , the Gaulish former ally of Julius Caesar who fled to Britain following the uprising of Vercingetorix , or possibly of his son . Eppillus is n't mentioned in any historical sources . Coins bearing his name also bear the inscription COMMI.FILI which is generally read as Commios filius indicating at least a claim to be Commius 's son . After Commius 's death in about 20 BC , based on numismatic evidence , Eppillus seems to have ruled jointly with another ruler named Tincomarus . The COMMI.FILI inscription also appears on Tincomarus 's coins suggesting they could have been brothers . Eppillus 's capital was Noviomagus ( Chichester ) in the south of the kingdom , while Tincomarus ruled from Calleva Atrebatum ( Silchester ) in the north . Eppillus became ruler of the whole territory a little before AD 7 , and Tincomarus appears as a supplicant to the emperor Augustus in his Res Gestae , so he would seem to have been driven out in some sort of domestic intrigue . After this , Eppillus 's coins are marked Rex , indicating that he was recognised as king by Rome . A single stater has been found in Dover bearing the name of Eppillus and an otherwise unknown Anarevito . The relationship between the two is unclear although it has been suggested that they were allied rulers . In about AD 15 , Eppillus was succeeded as king of the Atrebates by another man named , Verica .",
  "/wiki/Verica": "Verica ( early 1st century AD ) was a British client king of the Roman Empire in the years preceding the Claudian invasion of 43 AD . From his coinage , he appears to have been king of the , probably Belgic , Atrebates tribe and a son of Commius . He succeeded his elder brother Eppillus as king in about 15 AD , reigning at Calleva Atrebatum , today called Silchester . He was recognised as rex by Rome and appears to have had friendly trade and diplomatic links with the empire . His territory was pressed from the east by the Catuvellauni , led by Epaticcus , brother of Cunobelinus , who conquered Calleva in about 25 AD . After Epaticcus 's death ca . 35 AD Verica regained some territory , but Cunobelinus 's son Caratacus took over and conquered the entire kingdom some time after 40 AD . Dio Cassius records that Bericus ( almost certainly Verica ) was expelled from Britain around this time during a revolt . Suetonius refers to demands by the Britons that Rome return certain deserters . As rex , Verica was nominally an ally of Rome , so his exile gave Claudius an excuse to begin his invasion . Verica 's relationship with Rome has been used to argue for the site of the Roman invasion of Britain as being along the south coast to assist him , rather than being at the traditional spot at Richborough in Kent . After the invasion , Verica may have been restored as king , but this is not attested in the historical or archaeological record .",

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points .

The town was originally known as Inderawuda and was founded around 700 AD by Saint John of Beverley during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria . After a period of Viking control , it passed to the Cerdic dynasty , a period during which it gained prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain . It continued to grow especially under the Normans when its trading industry was first established . A place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages due to its founder , it eventually became a significant wool-trading town . Beverley was once the tenth-largest town in England , as well as one of the richest , because of its wool and the pilgrims who came to venerate its founding saint , John of Beverley . After the Reformation , the stature of Beverley was much reduced . In the 20th century , Beverley was the administrative centre of the local government district of the Borough of Beverley ( 1974-1996 ) .

Julius Caesar does not mention the Iceni in his account of his invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 BC , though they may be related to the Cenimagni , whom Caesar notes as living north of the River Thames at that time . The Iceni were a significant power in eastern Britain during Claudius ' conquest of Britain in AD 43 , in which they allied with Rome . Increasing Roman influence on their affairs led to revolt in AD 47 , though they remained nominally independent under king Prasutagus until his death around AD 60 . Roman encroachment after Prasutagus ' death led his wife Boudica to launch a major revolt from 60-61 . Boudica 's uprising seriously endangered Roman rule in Britain and resulted in the burning of Londinium and other cities . The Romans finally crushed the rebellion , and the Iceni were increasingly incorporated into the Roman province .",

  "/wiki/Hallaton_Treasure": "The Hallaton Treasure , the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins , was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton in southeast Leicestershire , England , by volunteers from the Hallaton Fieldwork Group . The initial find was made by Ken Wallace on 19 November 2000 , when he found about 130 coins with a metal detector . Along with local community archaeologists , the University of Leicester Archaeological Services ( ULAS ) excavated what turned out to be one of the most important Iron Age excavations and community archaeology projects in Britain . The hoard includes over 5,000 silver and gold coins , a silver-gilt Roman parade helmet , jewellery , and other objects . Most of the items date to around the time of the Roman Conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD . Of the coins from the site , 4,835 can be attributed to the local tribe , the Corieltauvi . This find more than doubled the total number of Corieltauvian coins previously recorded . A silver Roman coin from the hoard has been dated by local museums to 211 BC , and is the oldest Roman coin found in Britain . Some archaeologists have however speculated that it found its way into Britain before the Roman conquest in 43 AD and is evidence of exchange through trade or diplomacy . The site of the treasure proved to be an internationally important ritual site dating mostly to the generations before and after the Roman Conquest . Archaeologists believe that the site is a type of open air shrine that is the first of its kind to have been discovered in the UK . It was located on a hilltop in the Welland valley and was probably enclosed by a ditch and palisade .",

  "/wiki/Hallaton_Helmet": "The Hallaton Helmet is a decorated iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally covered in a sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf . It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton , Leicestershire after Ken Wallace , a member of the Hallaton Fieldwork Group , found coins in the area . Further investigation by professional archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine . Nine years of conservation and restoration have been undertaken by experts from the British Museum , supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of \u00a3650,000 . The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard . Although it was found shattered into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded , the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design . It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes . It would have been used by a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle . The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site , buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins . It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the Roman conquest of Britain .",
