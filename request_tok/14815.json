It has 32 kilobytes of RAM , and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system . The Electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets . It was capable of basic graphics , and could display onto either a television set , a colour ( RGB ) monitor or a green screen monitor . For a short period , the Electron was reportedly the best selling micro in the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Amstrad_CPC": "The Amstrad CPC ( short for Colour Personal Computer ) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990 . It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",

  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992 .",

The initial catalog of twelve games included Nintendo 's Donkey Kong as the pack-in cartridge , Sega 's Zaxxon , and some lesser known arcade titles that found a larger audience on the console , such as Lady Bug , Cosmic Avenger , and Venture . Approximately 145 titles in total were published as ROM cartridges for the system between 1982 and 1984 . Coleco released a series of hardware add-ons and special controllers to expand the capabilities of the console . The ColecoVision was discontinued in 1985 when Coleco withdrew from the video game market .",

  "/wiki/MSX": "MSX is a standardized home computer architecture , announced by Microsoft and ASCII on June 16 , 1983 . It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi , then vice-president at Microsoft and director at ASCII Corporation . Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period , in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines . MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries . It is difficult to determine how many MSX computers were sold worldwide , but eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone . Despite Microsoft 's involvement , few MSX-based machines were released in the United States . Before the great success of Nintendo 's Family Computer , MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft produced video games . The Metal Gear series , for example , was first written for MSX hardware .",

It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III , the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles , which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors . The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil .",

To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/PlayStation_Portable": "The PlayStation Portable [ a ] ( PSP ) is a handheld game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 12 , 2004 , in North America on March 24 , 2005 , and in PAL regions on September 1 , 2005 , and is the first handheld installment in the PlayStation line of consoles . As a seventh generation console , the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS . Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed . The PSP 's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device , which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles , computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software , other PSP systems , and the Internet . The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format - Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) - as its primary storage medium . The PSP was received positively by critics , and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime . Several models of the console were released , before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita , released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later . The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store , which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31 , 2016 . Hardware shipments of the PSP ended worldwide in 2014 ; production of UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016 .",
  "/wiki/Java_Platform": "Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems , which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation , that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment . Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers . Java applets , which are less common than standalone Java applications , were commonly run in secure , sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages . Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages , including Ada , JavaScript , Python , and Ruby . In addition , several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM , including Clojure , Groovy , and Scala . Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++ , but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap ( while some implementations e.g . all currently supported by Oracle , may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead ) and all variables of object types are references . Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM . On November 13 , 2006 , Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in October 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version ( Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support ) , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java , because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 ( Java 12 is also an non-LTS option ) .",
  "/wiki/Web_browser": "A web browser ( commonly referred to as a browser ) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web . When a user requests a particular website , the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the resulting web page on the user 's device . A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine , though the two are often confused . For a user , a search engine is just a website , such as Google Search , Bing , or DuckDuckGo , that stores searchable data about other websites . However , to connect to a website 's server and display its web pages , a user must have a web browser installed . In 2019 , an estimated 4.3 billion people used a browser . Google Chrome is the most used browser , with a 64 % market share on all platforms , followed by Safari with 17 % .",
  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",
  "/wiki/IOS": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually ."
