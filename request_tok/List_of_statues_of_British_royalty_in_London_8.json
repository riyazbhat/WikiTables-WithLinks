He was the first monarch of the House of Tudor . Henry attained the throne when his forces defeated King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field , the culmination of the Wars of the Roses . He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle . He cemented his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York , daughter of Richard 's brother Edward IV . Henry was successful in restoring the power and stability of the English monarchy after the civil war . Henry is credited with a number of administrative , economic and diplomatic initiatives . His supportive policy toward England 's wool industry and his standoff with the Low Countries had long-lasting benefit to the whole English economy . He paid very close attention to detail , and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising new revenues . New taxes stabilised the government 's finances , although a commission after his death found widespread abuses in the tax collection process . After a reign of nearly 24 years , he was peacefully succeeded by his son , Henry VIII",
  "/wiki/Westminster_Abbey": "Westminster Abbey , formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster , is a large , mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster , London , England , just to the west of the Palace of Westminster .

The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539 . Between 1540 and 1556 , the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England Royal Peculiar - a church responsible directly to the sovereign . According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the seventh century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III . Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066 , all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey . There have been 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 .

During his reign , the realm was governed by a regency council because he never reached maturity .

Edward 's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion . An expensive war with Scotland , at first successful , ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace . The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward , who took great interest in religious matters . Although his father , Henry VIII , had severed the link between the Church and Rome , Henry VIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony . It was during Edward 's reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass , and the imposition of compulsory services in English . In February 1553 , at age 15 , Edward fell ill . When his sickness was discovered to be terminal , he and his Council drew up a Devise for the Succession , to prevent the country 's return to Catholicism",
