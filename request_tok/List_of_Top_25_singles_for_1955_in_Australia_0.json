It was a number one single on both the United States and United Kingdom charts and also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s .

Haley 's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that , more than any other , brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world . The song is ranked No . 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine 's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . Although it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20 , 1954 , Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but , for various reasons , Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12 , 1954 . The original full title of the song was We 're Gon na Rock Around the Clock Tonight ! . This was later shortened to ( We 're Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock , though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording ; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others ( including Sonny Dae ) shorten this title further to Rock Around the Clock .
