  "/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism": "The schools of Buddhism are the various institutional and doctrinal divisions of Buddhism that have existed from ancient times up to the present . The classification and nature of various doctrinal , philosophical or cultural facets of the schools of Buddhism is vague and has been interpreted in many different ways , often due to the sheer number ( perhaps thousands ) of different sects , subsects , movements , etc . that have made up or currently make up the whole of Buddhist traditions . The sectarian and conceptual divisions of Buddhist thought are part of the modern framework of Buddhist studies , as well as comparative religion in Asia . From a largely English-language standpoint , and to some extent in most of Western academia , Buddhism is separated into two groups at its foundation : Therav\u0101da , literally the Teaching of the Elders or the Ancient Teaching , and Mah\u0101y\u0101na , literally the Great Vehicle . The most common classification among scholars is threefold , with Mah\u0101y\u0101na itself split between the traditional Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings , and the Vajray\u0101na teachings which emphasize esotericism .",
  "/wiki/Mahayana": "Mah\u0101y\u0101na ( English : /\u02ccm\u0251\u02d0h\u0259\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/ ; Devanagari : \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0928 /\u02ccm\u0259h\u0251\u02d0\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/ for Great Vehicle ) is one of two main existing branches of Buddhism ( the other being Theravada ) and a term for classification of Buddhist philosophies and practice . This movement added a further set of discourses , and although it was initially small in India , it had long-term historical significance . The Buddhist tradition of Vajrayana is sometimes classified as a part of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism , but some scholars consider it to be a different branch altogether . Mah\u0101y\u0101na also refers to the path of the Bodhisattva seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings , also called Bodhisattvay\u0101na , or the Bodhisattva Vehicle . [ note 1 ] A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksa\u1e43buddha ( \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 ) , or fully enlightened Buddha . A samyaksa\u1e43buddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment . Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists teach that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime , and this can be accomplished even by a layperson . The Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today , with 53% of practitioners , compared to 36% for Theravada and 6% for Vajrayana in 2010 . In the course of its history , Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism spread from India to various other South , East and Southeast Asian countries such as Bangladesh , Nepal , Bhutan , China , Taiwan , Mongolia , Korea , Japan , Vietnam , Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore . Mahayana Buddhism also spread to other South and Southeast Asian countries , such as Afghanistan , Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , the Maldives , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Burma , Iran and other Central Asian countries before being replaced by Theravada Buddhism , Islam , or other religions . Large Mah\u0101y\u0101na scholastic centers such as Nalanda thrived during the latter period of Buddhism in India , between the seventh and twelfth centuries . Major traditions of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism today include Chan Buddhism , Korean Seon , Japanese Zen , Pure Land Buddhism , Nichiren Buddhism and Vietnamese Buddhism .",

The term Pure Land Buddhism is used to describe both the Pure Land soteriology of Mahayana Buddhism , which may be better understood as Pure Land traditions or Pure Land teachings , and the separate Pure Land sects that developed in Japan from the work of H\u014dnen . Pure Land Buddhism is built on the belief that we will never have a world which is not corrupt , so we must strive for re-birth in another plane , referred to as the Pure Land .",

  "/wiki/Zen": "Zen ( Chinese : \u79aa ; pinyin : Ch\u00e1n ; Japanese : \u7985 , romanized : zen ; Korean : \uc120 , romanized : Seon ; Vietnamese : Thi\u1ec1n ) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty , there known as the Chan School ( Ch\u00e1nzong \u79aa\u5b97 ) and later developed into various schools . It was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy , especially Neo-Daoist thought , and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism . From China , Ch\u00e1n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n , northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism , and east to Japan , becoming Japanese Zen . The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa ( Ch\u00e1n ) , which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhy\u0101na ( meditation ) . [ note 1 ] Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint , meditation-practice , insight into the nature of mind ( Ch . jianxing , Jp . kensho , perceiving the true nature ) and nature of things , and the personal expression of this insight in daily life , especially for the benefit of others . As such , it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher . The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought , especially Yogachara , the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras , the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra , and the Huayan school , with their emphasis on Buddha-nature , totality , and the Bodhisattva-ideal . The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature as well as Madhyamaka thought have also been influential in the shaping of the apophatic and sometimes iconoclastic nature of Zen rhetoric .",

School of the Elders ) is the most commonly accepted name of Buddhism 's oldest extant school . The school 's adherents , termed Therav\u0101dins , have preserved their version of Gautama Buddha 's teaching in the P\u0101li Canon . The P\u0101li Canon is the only complete Buddhist canon surviving in a classical Indian language , P\u0101li , which serves as the school 's sacred language and lingua franca . For over a millennium , therav\u0101dins have endeavored to preserve the dhamma as recorded in their school 's texts . [ web 1 ] In contrast to Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na , Therav\u0101da tends to be conservative in matters of doctrine and monastic discipline . Modern Therav\u0101da derives from the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra sect , a Sri Lankan branch of the Vibhajjav\u0101dins , a sub-sect of the Indian Sthavira Nikaya , which began to establish itself on the island from the 3rd century BCE onwards . It was in Sri Lanka that the P\u0101li Canon was written down and the school 's commentary literature developed . From Sri Lanka , the Therav\u0101da Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition subsequently spread to the rest of Southeast Asia . It is the dominant religion in Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar , Sri Lanka , and Thailand and is practiced by minorities in India , Bangladesh , China , Nepal , and Vietnam . The diaspora of all of these groups , as well as converts around the world , also practice Therav\u0101da . During the modern era , new developments have included Buddhist modernism , the Vipassana movement which reinvigorated Therav\u0101da meditation practice [ web 1 ] and the Thai Forest Tradition which reemphasized forest monasticism .",
  "/wiki/Thai_Forest_Tradition": "The Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na Forest Tradition of Thailand ( Pali : kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na ; [ k\u0259m\u02d0\u0259\u0288\u02d0\u02b0a\u02d0na ] meaning place of work ) , commonly known in the West as the Thai Forest Tradition , is a lineage of Theravada Buddhist monasticism . The Thai Forest Tradition started around 1900 with Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto , who wanted to practice Buddhist monasticism , and its meditative practices , according to the normative standards of pre-sectarian Buddhism . After studying with Ajahn Sao Kantas\u012blo , and wandering through the north-east of Thailand , Ajahn Mun reportedly became a non-returner , and started to teach in North-East Thailand . He strived for a revival of the oldest Buddhism , insisting on a strict observance of the Buddhist monastic code , known as the Vinaya , and teaching the actual practice of jh\u0101na and the realisation of Nibb\u0101na . Initially Ajaan Mun 's teachings were met with fierce opposition , but in the 1930s his group was acknowledged as a formal faction of Thai Buddhism , and in the 1950s the relationship with the royal and religious establishment improved . In the 1960s western students started to be attracted , and in the 1970s Thai-oriented meditation groups spread in the west . The purpose of practice is to attain the Deathless ( Pali : amata-dhamma ) , c.q . Nibb\u0101na . Forest teachers directly challenge the notion of dry insight , and teach that Nibb\u0101na must be arrived at through mental training which includes deep states of meditative concentration ( Pali : jh\u0101na ) , and exertion and striving to cut or clear the path through the tangle of defilements , in order to set awareness free . Some representatives of the tradition regard the pure Original or Radiant Mind [ note 1 ] that remains when all mental productions are stopped as an undying essence . [ note 2 ]",
