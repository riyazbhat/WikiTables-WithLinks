Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in Shaumian 's twenty-three villages were expelled from the region . In December 1991 , with the Soviet Union imploding , Shaumian was claimed by the Nagorno-Karabakh and became the flashpoint of considerable fighting . This reached a climax in summer 1992 when most of the area was taken by the Azerbaijani army . Damage was severe and the Armenian population fled . Shaumian was renamed to A\u015fa\u011f\u0131 A\u011fcak\u0259nd in 1992 , and the town has since been partly re-populated by Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons .",
