Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , producers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches .

  "/wiki/Nick_Joaquin": "Nicomedes Nick M\u00e1rquez Joaqu\u00edn ( May 4 , 1917 - April 29 , 2004 ) was a Filipino writer and journalist best known for his short stories and novels in the English language .

He has been considered one of the most important Filipino writers , along with Jos\u00e9 Rizal and Claro M. Recto . Unlike Rizal and Recto , whose works were written in Spanish , Joaquin 's major works were written in English despite being a native Spanish speaker . Before becoming one of the leading practitioners of Philippine literature in English , he was a seminarian in Hong Kong - who later realized that he could better serve God and humanity by being a writer . This is reflected in the content and style of his works , as he emphasizes the need to restore national consciousness through important elements in Catholic Spanish Heritage . In his self-confessed mission as a writer , he is a sort of cultural apostle , whose purpose is to revive interest in Philippine national life through literature - and provide the necessary drive and inspiration for a fuller comprehension of their cultural background . His awareness of the significance of the past to the present is part of a concerted effort to preserve the spiritual tradition and the orthodox faith of the Catholic past - which he perceives as the only solution to our modern ills .",

  "/wiki/Painting": "Painting is the practice of applying paint , pigment , color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the matrix or support ) . The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush , but other implements , such as knives , sponges , and airbrushes , can be used . The final work is also called a painting . Painting is an important form in the visual arts , bringing in elements such as drawing , gesture ( as in gestural painting ) , composition , narration ( as in narrative art ) , or abstraction ( as in abstract art ) . Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in a still life or landscape painting ) , photographic , abstract , narrative , symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) , emotive ( as in Expressionism ) , or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) . A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin . In art , the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action . The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls , paper , canvas , wood , glass , lacquer , pottery , leaf , copper and concrete , and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand , clay , paper , plaster , gold leaf , as well as objects .",
  "/wiki/Visual_artist": "The visual arts are art forms such as painting , drawing , printmaking , sculpture , ceramics , photography , video , filmmaking , design , crafts , and architecture . Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts , conceptual art , textile arts also involve aspects of visual arts as well as arts of other types . Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design , graphic design , fashion design , interior design and decorative art . Current usage of the term visual arts includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts and crafts , but this was not always the case . Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century , the term 'artist ' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts ( such as painting , sculpture , or printmaking ) and not the decorative arts , craft , or applied art media . The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement , who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms . Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts , maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts . The increasing tendency to privilege painting , and to a lesser degree sculpture , above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art . In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist , and the furthest removed from manual labour - in Chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of scholar-painting , at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs . The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes .",
