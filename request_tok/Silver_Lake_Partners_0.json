  "/wiki/Initial_public_offering": "Initial public offering ( IPO ) or stock market launch is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors and usually also retail ( individual ) investors . An IPO is underwritten by one or more investment banks , who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchanges . Through this process , colloquially known as floating , or going public , a privately held company is transformed into a public company . Initial public offerings can be used to raise new equity capital for companies , to monetize the investments of private shareholders such as company founders or private equity investors , and to enable easy trading of existing holdings or future capital raising by becoming publicly traded . After the IPO , shares are traded freely in the open market at what is known as the free float . Stock exchanges stipulate a minimum free float both in absolute terms ( the total value as determined by the share price multiplied by the number of shares sold to the public ) and as a proportion of the total share capital ( i.e. , the number of shares sold to the public divided by the total shares outstanding ) . Although IPO offers many benefits , there are also significant costs involved , chiefly those associated with the process such as banking and legal fees , and the ongoing requirement to disclose important and sometimes sensitive information . Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus . Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter . Underwriters provide several services , including help with correctly assessing the value of shares ( share price ) and establishing a public market for shares ( initial sale ) .
