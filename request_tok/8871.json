  "/wiki/Thin_Lizzy": "Thin Lizzy are a hard rock band formed in Dublin , Ireland , in 1969 . Two of the founding members , drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and lead vocalist Phil Lynott , met while still in school . Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums , writing most of the material . The singles Whiskey in the Jar ( a traditional Irish ballad ) , The Boys Are Back in Town and Waiting for an Alibi were international hits . After Lynott 's death in 1986 , various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes , though Sykes left the band in 2009 . Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey . Lynott , Thin Lizzy 's de facto leader , was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band 's songs , and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music . Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history , with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section , on the drums and bass guitar . As well as being multiracial , the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles . Their music reflects a wide range of influences , including blues , soul music , psychedelic rock , and traditional Irish folk music , but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal . Rolling Stone magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock , far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack . AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that As the band 's creative force , Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk , preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan , Van Morrison , Bruce Springsteen , and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition .",

  "/wiki/Nirvana_(band)": "Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen , Washington in 1987 . It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic . Nirvana went through a succession of drummers , the longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl , who joined in 1990 . Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain , their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture . In the late 1980s , Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene , releasing its first album , Bleach , for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989 . They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts , often between quiet verses and loud , heavy choruses . After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991 , Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with Smells Like Teen Spirit , the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind ( 1991 ) . A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s , the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Nirvana 's sudden success popularized alternative rock , and Cobain found himself described as the spokesman of a generation and Nirvana the flagship band of Generation X . Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning , Nirvana released their third studio album , In Utero ( 1993 ) , to critical acclaim and further chart success . Its abrasive , less mainstream sound challenged the band 's audience , and though less successful than Nevermind , it was a commercial success . Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994 .",
