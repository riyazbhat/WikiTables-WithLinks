  "/wiki/BBC_Micro": "The British Broadcasting Corporation Microcomputer System , or BBC Micro , is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company in the 1980s for the BBC Computer Literacy Project , operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation . Designed with an emphasis on education , it was notable for its ruggedness , expandability , and the quality of its operating system . An accompanying 1982 television series , The Computer Programme , featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine , was broadcast on BBC2 . After the Literacy Project 's call for bids for a computer to accompany the TV programmes and literature , Acorn won the contract with the Proton , a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice . Renamed the BBC Micro , the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom , changing Acorn 's fortunes . It was also successful as a home computer in the UK , despite its high cost . Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which , many years later , has become hugely successful for embedded systems , including tablets and cellphones . In 2013 ARM was the most widely used 32-bit instruction set architecture . While nine models were eventually produced with the BBC brand , the phrase BBC Micro is usually used colloquially to refer to the first six ( Model A , B , B+64 , B+128 , Master 128 , and Master Compact ) , excluding the Acorn Electron ; subsequent BBC models are considered part of Acorn 's Archimedes series .",
  "/wiki/BBC_Master": "The BBC Master is a home computer released by Acorn Computers in early 1986 . It was designed and built for the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) and was the successor to the BBC Micro Model B . The Master 128 remained in production until 1993 .",
  "/wiki/Acorn_Electron": "The Acorn Electron was a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd . It has 32 kilobytes of RAM , and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system . The Electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets . It was capable of basic graphics , and could display onto either a television set , a colour ( RGB ) monitor or a green screen monitor . For a short period , the Electron was reportedly the best selling micro in the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/RISC_OS": "RISC OS /r\u026asko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ is a computer operating system originally designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge , England . First released in 1987 , it was designed to run on the ARM chipset , which Acorn had designed concurrently for use in its new line of Archimedes personal computers . RISC OS takes its name from the reduced instruction set computer ( RISC ) architecture it supports . Between 1987 and 1998 , RISC OS was included in every ARM-based Acorn computer model , including the Acorn Archimedes line , Acorn 's R line ( with RISC iX as a dual boot option ) , RiscPC , A7000 , and prototype models such as the Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer . A version of the OS , named NCOS , was used in Oracle Corporation 's Network Computer and compatible systems . After the break-up of Acorn in 1998 , development of the OS was forked and continued separately by several companies , including RISCOS Ltd , Pace Micro Technology , and Castle Technology . Since then , it has been bundled with several ARM-based desktop computers such as the Iyonix PC and A9home . As of March 2017 [ update ] , the OS remains forked and is independently developed by RISCOS Ltd and the RISC OS Open community . Most recent stable versions run on the ARMv3/ARMv4 RiscPC , the ARMv5 Iyonix , ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processors ( such as that used in the BeagleBoard and Touch Book ) and Cortex-A9 processors ( such as that used in the PandaBoard ) . There is a development version for the Raspberry Pi . SD card images have been released for downloading free of charge to Raspberry Pi 1 , 2 , & 3 users with a full graphical user interface ( GUI ) version and a command-line interface only version ( RISC OS Pico , at 3.8 MB ) . In October 2018 , RISC OS 5 was relicensed under the Apache 2.0 license .",
  "/wiki/DOS": "DOS ( /d\u0252s/ , /d\u0254\u02d0s/ ) is a platform-independent acronym for Disk Operating System which later became a common shorthand for disk-based operating systems on IBM PC compatibles . DOS primarily consists of Microsoft 's MS-DOS and a rebranded IBM version under the name PC DOS , both of which were introduced in 1981 . Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include DR DOS ( 1988 ) , ROM-DOS ( 1989 ) , PTS-DOS ( 1993 ) , and FreeDOS ( 1998 ) . MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995 . Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym DOS , beginning with the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966 . Others include Apple DOS , Apple ProDOS , Atari DOS , Commodore DOS , TRSDOS , and AmigaDOS .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",

  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",

  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",

  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/Web_browser": "A web browser ( commonly referred to as a browser ) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web . When a user requests a particular website , the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the resulting web page on the user 's device . A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine , though the two are often confused . For a user , a search engine is just a website , such as Google Search , Bing , or DuckDuckGo , that stores searchable data about other websites . However , to connect to a website 's server and display its web pages , a user must have a web browser installed . In 2019 , an estimated 4.3 billion people used a browser .

  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",
  "/wiki/Java_Applet": "A Java applet was a small application written in the Java programming language , or another programming language that compiles to Java bytecode , and delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode . The user launched the Java applet from a web page , and the applet was then executed within a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) in a process separate from the web browser itself . A Java applet could appear in a frame of the web page , a new application window , Sun 's AppletViewer , or a stand-alone tool for testing applets . Java applets were introduced in the first version of the Java language , which was released in 1995 . Beginning in 2013 , major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology applets used to run , with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015-2017 . Java applets were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 ( 18.9 ) , released in September 2018 . Java applets were usually written in Java , but other languages such as Jython , JRuby , Pascal , Scala , or Eiffel ( via SmartEiffel ) may be used as well . Java applets run at very fast speeds and until 2011 , they were many times faster than JavaScript . Unlike JavaScript , Java applets had access to 3D hardware acceleration , making them well-suited for non-trivial , computation-intensive visualizations . As browsers have gained support for hardware-accelerated graphics thanks to the canvas technology ( or specifically WebGL in the case of 3D graphics ) , as well as just-in-time compiled JavaScript , the speed difference has become less noticeable . [ citation needed ] Since Java bytecode is cross-platform ( or platform independent ) , Java applets can be executed by browsers ( or other clients ) for many platforms , including Microsoft Windows , FreeBSD , Unix , macOS and Linux . They can not be run on modern mobile devices , which do not support Java .",
  "/wiki/MAME": "MAME ( originally an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator ) is a free and open-source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms . The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten . The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines ; the ability to actually play the games is considered a nice side effect . Joystiq has listed MAME as an application that every Windows and Mac gamer should have . The first public MAME release was by Nicola Salmoria on February 5 , 1997 . The emulator now supports over 7,000 unique games and 10,000 actual ROM image sets , though not all of the supported games are playable . MESS , an emulator for many video game consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core , was integrated upstream into MAME in 2015 .",

As of April 2015 MESS supported 994 unique systems with 2,106 total system variations . However , not all of the systems in MESS are functional ; some are marked as non-working or are in development . MESS was first released in 1998 and has been under constant development since . MAME and MESS were once separate applications , but were later developed and released together from a single source repository . MAMEDEV member David Haywood maintained and distributed UME ( Universal Machine Emulator ) which combined much of the functionality of MAME and MESS in a single application . On May 27 , 2015 , MESS was formally integrated with MAME and became a part of MAME .",

  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms ."
