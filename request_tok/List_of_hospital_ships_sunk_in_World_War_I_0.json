Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships , they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ( commerce raiding ) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping . The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire , and from the United States to the United Kingdom and ( during the Second World War ) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean . German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II , causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 .

UB-10 was credited with sinking 37 ships , about two-thirds of them British fishing vessels . The first ship sunk , the neutral Dutch steamer Katwijk , provoked outrage in the Netherlands and helped turn Dutch public opinion against Germany . That sinking was also the impetus behind a renewed effort to avoid attacking neutral ships by U-boats .

The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

Rossiya , IPA : [ r\u0250\u02c8s\u02b2ij\u0259 ] ) , or the Russian Federation , [ e ] is a European country located in Eastern Europe with a vast expanse of territory that stretches across Northern Asia . At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations .

  "/wiki/Black_Sea": "The Black Sea is a body of water and marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean between Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , and Western Asia . It is supplied by a number of major rivers , such as the Danube , Dnieper , Southern Bug , Dniester , Don , and the Rioni . The watersheds of many countries drain into the Black Sea beyond the six that immediately border it . The Black Sea has an area of 436,400 km2 ( 168,500 sq mi ) ( not including the Sea of Azov ) , a maximum depth of 2,212 m ( 7,257 ft ) , and a volume of 547,000 km3 ( 131,000 cu mi ) . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south , Caucasus Mountains to the east , Crimean Mountains to the north , Strandzha to the southwest , Balkan Mountains to the west , Dobrogea Plateau to the northwest , and features a wide shelf to the northwest . The longest east-west extent is about 1,175 km ( 730 mi ) . Important cities along the coast include Odessa , Sevastopol , Samsun , and Istanbul . The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , Georgia , and Russia . It has a positive water balance ; that is , a net outflow of water 300 km3 ( 72 cu mi ) per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea . There is a two-way hydrological exchange : the more saline and therefore denser , but warmer , Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow . This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters . The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea , via the Aegean Sea and various straits , and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean .",

Its East Cliff is home to the ruins of Whitby Abbey , where C\u00e6dmon , the earliest recognised English poet , lived . The fishing port emerged during the Middle Ages , supporting important herring and whaling fleets , and was where Captain Cook learned seamanship . Tourism started in Whitby during the Georgian period and developed with the arrival of the railway in 1839 . Its attraction as a tourist destination is enhanced by the proximity of the high ground of the North York Moors national park and the heritage coastline and by association with the horror novel Dracula . Jet and alum were mined locally , and Whitby Jet , which was mined by the Romans and Victorians , became fashionable during the 19th century . The earliest record of a permanent settlement is in 656 , when as Strean\u00e6shealh it was the place where Oswy , the Christian king of Northumbria , founded the first abbey , under the abbess Hilda . The Synod of Whitby was held there in 664 . In 867 , the monastery was destroyed by Viking raiders . Another monastery was founded in 1078 . It was in this period that the town gained its current name , Whitby ( from white settlement in Old Norse ) ."
