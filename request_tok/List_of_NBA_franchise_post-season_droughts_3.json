In the early years of the NBA the team reached the NBA Finals twice in consecutive years before falling to the Lakers and then to the St. Louis Hawks . Following an extended era of mediocrity the Pistons , led by the Hall of Fame backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and nicknamed the Bad Boys for their intimidating defence , posted winning records every seasons from 1983-84 to 1991-92 , and after narrowly losing in 1988 , ended the Lakers dynasty of the 1980s the following season and repeated the following year . The Pistons third period of success , with former on-court star Dumars serving as general manager and building a top team from other franchises discards , occurred between 2001-02 and 2007-08 when the team won fifty games or more during every season , including a third NBA title in 2003-04 and a franchise record total of wins two seasons later . The Pistons have experienced two major periods of failure . Between 1956-57 and 1982-83 , the Pistons had just three winning seasons and overall had a winning percentage of .417 , culminating in a combined record of 37-127 ( win percent .226 ) in the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons , after which the drafting of Isiah Thomas completely revitalized the franchise .

In the six seasons starting in 2009-10 the franchise had an overall record of 172 wins from 476 games or a winning percentage of .361",
