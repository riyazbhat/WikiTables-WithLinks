Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the commonwealth . CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world . From its headquarters in Canberra , CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France , Chile and the United States , employing about 5,500 people . Federally funded scientific research began in Australia 103 years ago . The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance . In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) , which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding . CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes . [ citation needed ] In 1949 further legislated changes included renaming the organisation as CSIRO . [ citation needed ] Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy , essential components of Wi-Fi technology , development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote , the invention of the insect repellent in Aerogard and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia , such as the introduction of myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus for the control of rabbit populations .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
