  "/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1951)": "The Treaty of Paris ( formally the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community ) was signed on 18 April 1951 between France , West Germany , Italy and the three Benelux countries ( Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands ) , establishing the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) , which subsequently became part of the European Union . The treaty came into force on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002 , exactly fifty years after it came into effect . The treaty was seen as producing diplomatic and economic stability in western Europe after the Second World War . Some of the main enemies during the war were now sharing production of coal and steel , the key resources which previously had been central to the war effort . The Europe Declaration was signed by all the leaders present . It declared that the Treaty had given birth to Europe . It emphasised that the supranational principle was the foundation of the new democratic organisation of Europe . The supranational concept was opposed by Charles de Gaulle .",
  "/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community": "The European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) was an organisation of six European countries created after World War II to regulate their industrial production under a centralised authority . It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris , signed by Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany . The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on the principles of supranationalism , and started the process of formal integration which ultimately led to the European Union . The ECSC was first proposed by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany . He declared his aim was to make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible which was to be achieved by regional integration , of which the ECSC was the first step . The Treaty would create a common market for coal and steel among its member states which served to neutralise competition between European nations over natural resources , particularly in the Ruhr . The ECSC was overseen by four institutions : a High Authority composed of independent appointees , a Common Assembly composed of national parliamentarians , a Special Council composed of national ministers , and a Court of Justice . These would ultimately form the blueprint for today 's European Commission , European Parliament , the Council of the European Union and the European Court of Justice . The ECSC stood as a model for the communities set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 , the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community , with whom it shared its membership and some institutions . The 1967 Merger ( Brussels ) Treaty led all of ECSC 's institutions to merge into the European Economic Community , but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality . In 2002 , the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form , its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of the Amsterdam and Nice treaties .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome": "The Treaty of Rome , officially the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community ( or EEC Treaty in short ) brought about the creation of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , the best-known of the European Communities ( EC ) . It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany and came into force on 1 January 1958 . Under the name Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , it remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day European Union ( EU ) . The TEEC proposed the progressive reduction of customs duties and the establishment of a customs union . It proposed to create a single market for goods , labour , services , and capital across the EEC 's member states . It also proposed the creation of a Common Agriculture Policy , a Common Transport Policy and a European Social Fund , and established the European Commission . The treaty has been amended on several occasions since 1957 . The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 removed the word economic from the Treaty of Rome 's official title and , in 2009 , the Treaty of Lisbon renamed it the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .",
  "/wiki/European_Economic_Community": "The European Economic Community ( EEC ) was a regional organisation that aimed to bring about economic integration among its member states . It was created by the Treaty of Rome of 1957 . [ note 1 ] Upon the formation of the European Union ( EU ) in 1993 , the EEC was incorporated and renamed the European Community ( EC ) . In 2009 , the EC 's institutions were absorbed into the EU 's wider framework and the community ceased to exist . The Community 's initial aim was to bring about economic integration , including a common market and customs union , among its six founding members : Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany . It gained a common set of institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty ( Treaty of Brussels ) . In 1993 a complete single market was achieved , known as the internal market , which allowed for the free movement of goods , capital , services , and people within the EEC . In 1994 the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement . This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association , forming the European Economic Area , which encompasses 15 countries . Upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 , the EEC was renamed the European Community to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy . This was also when the three European Communities , including the EC , were collectively made to constitute the first of the three pillars of the European Union , which the treaty also founded . The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon , which incorporated the EC 's institutions into the EU 's wider framework and provided that the EU would replace and succeed the European Community .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
  "/wiki/Euratom_Treaty": "The Euratom Treaty , officially the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community , established the European Atomic Energy Community . It was signed on 25 March 1957 , at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community ( EEC Treaty ) . The Euratom treaty is less well-known due to the lower profile of the organisation it founded . While the EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union , Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 , albeit governed by the institutions of the European Union . It was established with its own independent institutions , but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged the institutions of Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community with those of the EEC . The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment , due to the later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power amongst European public opinion . Owing to this , some argue that it has become too out-dated , particularly in the areas of democratic oversight . It was not included as part of the ( not ratified ) Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , which sought to combine all previous treaties , over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it . Nevertheless , it forms part of the active treaties of the European Union .",

However , over the years its scope has been considerably increased to cover a large variety of areas associated with nuclear power and ionising radiation as diverse as safeguarding of nuclear materials , radiation protection and construction of the International Fusion Reactor ITER . It is legally distinct from the European Union ( EU ) although it has the same membership , and is governed by many of the EU 's institutions ; but it is the only remaining community organisation that is independent of the EU and therefore outside the regulatory control of the European Parliament .

The Outermost Regions were recognised at the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007 . The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that both primary and secondary European Union law applies automatically to the outermost regions , with possible derogations due to the particularities of these territories . The Overseas Countries and Territories are recognised by the Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which allows them to opt into EU provisions on the freedom of movement for workers and freedom of establishment , and invites them to join the Overseas Countries and Territories Association ( OCTA ) in order to improve cooperation with the European Union .

  "/wiki/European_Political_Cooperation": "The European Political Cooperation ( EPC ) was introduced in 1970 and was the synonym for European Union foreign policy coordination until it was superseded by the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the Maastricht Treaty of November 1993 . In the 1950s and 1960s , the EC member states tried twice to give the internal market a foreign policy dimension but failed on both attempts . The idea of the supranational European Defence Community came about following a summit in The Hague ( 1969 ) in which the EC heads of state and government instructed their foreign ministers to study the best way of achieving progress in the matter of political unification , within the context of enlargement . The foreign ministers subsequently drafted the Luxembourg/Davignon report ( 1970 ) , which created an informal intergovernmental consultation mechanism where member states could achieve politics of scale ( Ginsberg , 1989 ) . While EPC adopted the intergovernmental nature of the Fouchet Plans , it disregarded the 'French grandeur ' of the Charles de Gaulle era . The involvement of the United Kingdom guaranteed its Atlanticist nature . The European Commission would furthermore be able to express its opinion if matters within its competencies were concerned . Finally , the EPC did not have the strong Paris-based Secretariat of the Fouchet proposals . The Netherlands had always been anxious about this idea , as they thought that it might turn into a competitor for the European Commission . The EPC was amended and strengthened in the Copenhagen report ( 1973 ) and London report ( 1981 ) . It was codified ( formalized ) with the Single European Act ( 1986 ) .

Thucydides also reports that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers of fifth century BC Greece , along with Athens and Corinth . Ruins of ancient Greek temples and other archaeological sites of the ancient city of Korkyra are found in Palaiopolis . Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the island are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans .",

  "/wiki/Schengen_Agreement": "The Schengen Agreement ( English : /\u02c8\u0283\u025b\u014b\u0259n/ ) is a treaty which led to the creation of Europe 's Schengen Area , in which internal border checks have largely been abolished . It was signed on 14 June 1985 , near the town of Schengen , Luxembourg , by five of the ten member states of the then European Economic Community . It proposed measures intended to gradually abolish border checks at the signatories ' common borders , including reduced speed vehicle checks which allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping , allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints , and the harmonisation of visa policies . In 1990 , the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the complete abolition of systematic internal border controls and a common visa policy . The Schengen Area operates very much like a single state for international travel purposes with external border controls for travellers entering and exiting the area , and common visas , but with no internal border controls . It currently consists of 26 European countries covering a population of over 400 million people and an area of 4,312,099 square kilometres ( 1,664,911 sq mi ) . Originally , the Schengen treaties and the rules adopted under them operated independently from the European Union . However , in 1999 they were incorporated into European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty , while providing opt-outs for the only two EU member states that had remained outside the Area : Ireland and the United Kingdom . Schengen is now a core part of EU law , and all EU member states without an opt-out which have not already joined the Schengen Area are legally obliged to do so when technical requirements have been met . Several non-EU countries are included in the area .",
  "/wiki/Amsterdam": "Amsterdam ( /\u02c8\u00e6mst\u0259rd\u00e6m/ , UK also /\u02cc\u00e6mst\u0259r\u02c8d\u00e6m/ ; Dutch : [ \u0251mst\u0259r\u02c8d\u0251m ] ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands with a population of 872,680 within the city proper , 1,380,872 in the urban area and 2,410,960 in the metropolitan area . Found within the province of North Holland , Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the Venice of the North , attributed by the large number of canals which form a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Amsterdam 's name derives from Amstelredamme , indicative of the city 's origin around a dam in the river Amstel . Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century , Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world in the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the city expanded , and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built . The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19-20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List . Sloten , annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam , is the oldest part of the city , dating to the 9th century . As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe , Amsterdam is considered an alpha-world city by the Globalization and World Cities ( GaWC ) study group . The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands . Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there , including Philips , AkzoNobel , TomTom and ING . Also , many of the world 's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city , such as leading technology companies Uber , Netflix and Tesla . In 2012 , Amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer .",
  "/wiki/Treaty_of_Nice": "The Treaty of Nice was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003 . It amended the Maastricht Treaty ( or the Treaty on European Union ) and the Treaty of Rome ( or the Treaty establishing the European Community which , before the Maastricht Treaty , was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community ) . The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion , a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty , but failed to be addressed at the time . The entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time , after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001 . This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later .",

The metropolitan area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits , with a population of about 1 million on an area of 721 km2 ( 278 sq mi ) . Located in the French Riviera , on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea , at the foot of the Alps , Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region after Marseille . Nice is approximately 13 kilometres ( 8.1 mi ) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from the French-Italian border . Nice 's airport serves as a gateway to the region . The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle ( Nissa La Bella in Ni\u00e7ard ) , which means Nice the Beautiful , which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice , written by Menica Rondelly in 1912 . The area of today 's Nice contains Terra Amata , an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago . Around 350 BC , Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia , after Nike , the goddess of victory . Through the ages , the town has changed hands many times . Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength . For centuries it was a dominion of Savoy , and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815 , when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia until its re-annexation by France in 1860 . The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century , when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there ."
