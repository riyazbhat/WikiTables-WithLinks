  "/wiki/Chicago_Sanitary_and_Ship_Canal": "The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , historically known as the Chicago Drainage Canal , is a 28-mile-long ( 45 km ) canal system that connects the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River . It reverses the direction of the Main Stem and the South Branch of the Chicago River , which now flows out of Lake Michigan rather than into it . The related Calumet-Saganashkee Channel does the same for the Calumet River a short distance to the south , joining the Chicago canal about halfway along its route to the Des Plaines . The two provide the only navigation for ships between the Great Lakes Waterway and the Mississippi River system . The canal was primarily built as a sewage treatment scheme . Prior to its opening in 1900 , sewage from the city of Chicago was dumped into the Chicago River and flowed into Lake Michigan . The city 's drinking water supply was located offshore , and there were fears that the sewage could reach the intake and cause serious disease outbreaks . Since the sewer systems were already flowing into the river , the decision was made to dam the river and reverse its flow , thereby sending all the sewage inland where it could be treated before emptying it into the Des Plaines . A secondary goal was to replace the shallow and narrow Illinois and Michigan Canal ( I & M ) , which had originally connected Lake Michigan with the Mississippi starting in 1848 . As part of the construction of the new canal , the entire route was built to allow much larger ships to navigate it . It is 202 feet ( 62 m ) wide and 24 feet ( 7.3 m ) deep , over three times the size of the I & M . The I & M became a secondary route with the new canal 's opening and was shut down entirely with the creation of the Illinois Waterway network in 1933 .",

US 66 was established on November 11 , 1926 , with road signs erected the following year . The highway , which became one of the most famous roads in the United States , originally ran from Chicago , Illinois , through Missouri , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona before ending in Santa Monica in Los Angeles County , California , covering a total of 2,448 miles ( 3,940 km ) . It was recognized in popular culture by both the hit song ( Get Your Kicks on ) Route 66 and the Route 66 television series , which aired on CBS from 1960 to 1964 . In John Steinbeck 's classic American novel , The Grapes of Wrath ( 1939 ) , the road Highway 66 symbolized escape and loss . US 66 served as a primary route for those who migrated west , especially during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s , and the road supported the economies of the communities through which it passed . People doing business along the route became prosperous due to the growing popularity of the highway , and those same people later fought to keep the highway alive in the face of the growing threat of being bypassed by the new Interstate Highway System . US 66 underwent many improvements and realignments over its lifetime , but was officially removed from the United States Highway System in 1985 after it had been replaced in its entirety by segments of the Interstate Highway System . Portions of the road that passed through Illinois , Missouri , New Mexico , and Arizona have been communally designated a National Scenic Byway by the name Historic Route 66 , returning the name to some maps . Several states have adopted significant bypassed sections of the former US 66 into their state road networks as State Route 66 . The corridor is also being redeveloped into U.S .

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_6": "U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) , also called the Grand Army of the Republic Highway , honoring the American Civil War veterans association , is a main route of the U.S. Highway system . While it currently runs east-northeast from Bishop , California to Provincetown , Massachusetts , the route has been modified several times . The highway 's longest-lasting routing , from 1936 to 1964 , had its western terminus at Long Beach , California . During this time , US 6 was the longest highway in the country . In 1964 , the state of California renumbered its highways , and most of the route within California was transferred to other highways . This dropped the highway 's length below that of US 20 . US 6 is a diagonal route , whose number is out of sequence with the rest of the U.S. Highway grid in the western US . When it was designated in 1926 , US 6 only ran east of Erie , Pennsylvania . Subsequent extensions , largely replacing the former U.S. Route 32 ( US 32 ) and US 38 , have taken it south of US 30 at Joliet , Illinois , US 40 near Denver , Colorado ( past the end of US 38 ) , US 50 at Ely , Nevada , and even US 70 near Los Angeles , California , due to its north-south alignment in that state . US 6 does not serve a major transcontinental corridor , unlike other highways . George R. Stewart , author of U.S. 40 : Cross Section of the United States of America , initially considered US 6 , but realized that Route 6 runs uncertainly from nowhere to nowhere , scarcely to be followed from one end to the other , except by some devoted eccentric . In the famous beat novel On the Road by Jack Kerouac , protagonist Sal Paradise actually considers hitchhiking on US 6 to Nevada , but is told by a driver that there 's no traffic passes through 6 and that he 'd be better off going via Pittsburgh ( the Pennsylvania Turnpike ) .",
