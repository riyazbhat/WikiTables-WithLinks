  "/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(91)": "HMS Ark Royal ( pennant number 91 ) was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that served during the Second World War . Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty , Ark Royal was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead , England , and completed in November 1938 . Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers . Ark Royal was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull , instead of an add-on or part of the superstructure . Designed to carry a large number of aircraft , she had two hangar deck levels . She served during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power ; several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard Ark Royal . Ark Royal served in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War . She was involved in the first aerial and U-boat kills of the war , operations off Norway , the search for the German battleship Bismarck , and the Malta Convoys . Ark Royal survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a 'lucky ship ' . She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the German submarine U-81 and sank the following day ; one of her 1,488 crew members was killed . Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries ; investigators were keen to know how the carrier was lost , in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at Gibraltar . They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss , which were rectified in new British carriers",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt": "The Kingdom of Egypt ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629 , romanized : Al-Mamlaka Al-Mi\u1e63reyya ) was the Egyptian state established under the Muhammad Ali dynasty in 1922 following the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence by the United Kingdom . Until the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 , the Kingdom was only nominally independent , since the British retained control of foreign relations , communications , the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . Between 1936 and 1952 , the British continued to maintain military presence and political advisers , at a reduced level . The legal status of Egypt had been highly convoluted , due to its de facto breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in 1805 , its occupation by Britain in 1882 , and its transformation into a sultanate and British protectorate in 1914 . In line with the change in status from sultanate to kingdom , the Sultan of Egypt , Fuad I , saw his title changed to King . The kingdom 's sovereignty was subject to severe limitations imposed by the British , who retained enormous control over Egyptian affairs , and whose military continued to occupy the country . Throughout the kingdom 's existence , the Sudan was formally united with Egypt . However , actual Egyptian authority in the Sudan was largely nominal due to Britain 's role as the dominant power in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . During the reign of King Fuad , the monarchy struggled with the Wafd Party , a broadly based nationalist political organization strongly opposed to British domination , and with the British themselves , who were determined to maintain control over the Suez Canal . Other political forces emerging in this period included the Communist Party ( 1925 ) , and the Muslim Brotherhood ( 1928 ) , which eventually became a potent political and religious force . King Fuad died in 1936 and Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen . Alarmed by the Kingdom of Italy 's recent invasion of Abyssinia , he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty , requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt , except in the Suez Canal Zone ( agreed to be evacuated by 1949 )",

  "/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine": "Mandatory Palestine [ a ] P\u0101l\u0113\u015bt\u012bn\u0101 ( EY ) , where EY indicates Eretz Yisrael Land of Israel ) was a geopolitical entity established between 1920 and 1948 in the region of Palestine under the terms of the Mandate for Palestine . During the First World War ( 1914-18 ) , an Arab uprising and the British Empire 's Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby drove the Turks out of the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . The United Kingdom had agreed in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence that it would honour Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans , but the two sides had different interpretations of this agreement , and in the end , the UK and France divided up the area under the Sykes-Picot Agreement - an act of betrayal in the eyes of the Arabs . Further complicating the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , promising British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine . At the war 's end the British and French set up a joint Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in what had been Ottoman Syria . The British achieved legitimacy for their continued control by obtaining a mandate from the League of Nations in June 1922 . The formal objective of the League of Nations mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire , which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century , until such time as they are able to stand alone . During the British Mandate period the area experienced the ascent of two major nationalist movements , one among the Jews and the other among the Palestinian Arabs . The competing national interests of the two populations against each other and against the governing British authorities matured into the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939 and the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine , before culminating in the 1947-1949 Palestine war . This led to the establishment of the 1949 cease-fire agreement , with partition of the former Mandatory Palestine between the newborn state of Israel with a Jewish majority , the Arab West Bank annexed by the Jordanian Kingdom and the Arab All-Palestine Protectorate in the Gaza Strip under Egypt",

The state was declared on 1 September 1920 , following Decree 318 of 31 August 1920 , as a League of Nations Mandate under the proposed terms of the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon which was to be ratified in 1923 . When the Ottoman Empire was formally split up by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres in 1920 , it was decided that four of its territories in the Middle East should be League of Nations mandates temporarily governed by the United Kingdom and France on behalf of the League . The British were given Palestine and Iraq , while the French were given a mandate over Syria and Lebanon . General Gouraud proclaimed the establishment of the state with its present boundaries after splitting a few Syrian villages on the southern and western borders with Lebanon and adding them to Lebanon and with Beirut as its capital . The new territory was granted a flag , merging the French flag with the Lebanese cedar",

In 1963 , the Syrian Ba'athist Party came to power in a bloody military coup , which laid foundations for the political structure in Syria for the next decades"
