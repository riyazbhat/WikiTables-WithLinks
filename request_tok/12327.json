  "/wiki/Buckton_Castle": "Buckton Castle was a medieval enclosure castle near Carrbrook in Stalybridge , Greater Manchester , England . It was surrounded by a 2.8-metre-wide ( 9 ft ) stone curtain wall and a ditch 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide by 6 metres ( 20 ft ) deep . Buckton is one of the earliest stone castles in North West England and only survives as buried remains overgrown with heather and peat . It was most likely built and demolished in the 12th century . The earliest surviving record of the site dates from 1360 , by which time it was lying derelict . The few finds retrieved during archaeological investigations indicate that Buckton Castle may not have been completed . In the 16th century , the site may have been used as a beacon for the Pilgrimage of Grace . During the 18th century , the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton . The site was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site during the Second World War . Between 1996 and 2010 , Buckton Castle was investigated by archaeologists as part of the Tameside Archaeology Survey , first by the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford 's Centre for Applied Archaeology . The project involved community archaeology , and more than 60 volunteers took part . The castle , close to the Buckton Vale Quarry , is a Scheduled Ancient Monument .",
  "/wiki/Carrbrook": "Carrbrook is an area in the east of Stalybridge , in Greater Manchester , England . The area still has many seventeenth and eighteenth century buildings . Much of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century village was built during the industrial boom brought by the printworks . Modern Housing estates were built next to the old village on the lower flank of Harridge Pike from the 1970s . The view to the east of Carrbrook is dominated by the steep-sided Buckton Hill , on the summit of which is located Buckton Castle . Neighbouring communities include Millbrook , Heyheads and Micklehurst . Many properties in Carrbrook were threatened by a large wildfire burning on Saddleworth Moor in late June 2018 . On 26 June , 50 properties in Carrbrook were evacuated as the fire advanced towards the settlement .",

  "/wiki/River_Irwell": "The River Irwell ( /\u02c8\u025c\u02d0rw\u025bl/ UR-wel ) is a 39-mile ( 63 km ) long river which flows through the Irwell Valley in North West England . Its source is at Irwell Springs on Deerplay Moor , approximately 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) north of Bacup . It forms the boundary between Manchester and Salford and empties into the River Mersey near Irlam . In the 17th and 18th centuries , the Irwell 's lower reaches were a trading route that became part of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation . In the 19th century , the river 's course downstream of Manchester was permanently altered by the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896 . The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and led to the development of Trafford Park which became the largest industrial estate in Europe . Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford , such as the Anaconda Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014 . The river became severely polluted by industrial waste in the Industrial Revolution , but in the second half of the 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve water quality , restock it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife . Stretches of the river flowing through Manchester and Salford have attracted large-scale investment in business and residential developments , such as Salford Quays , and other parts have become important wildlife havens . The Irwell is used for recreational activities , such as pleasure cruising , rowing , racing , swimming and fishing .",
  "/wiki/Moat": "A moat is a deep , broad ditch , either dry or filled with water , that is dug and surrounds a castle , fortification , building or town , historically to provide it with a preliminary line of defence . In some places moats evolved into more extensive water defences , including natural or artificial lakes , dams and sluices . In older fortifications , such as hillforts , they are usually referred to simply as ditches , although the function is similar . In later periods , moats or water defences may be largely ornamental . They could also act as a sewer .",
  "/wiki/Keep": "A keep ( from the Middle English kype ) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility . Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep , but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences , used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary . The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the Motte-and-Bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century ; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066 , and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s . The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries ; these included Norman keeps , with a square or rectangular design , and circular shell keeps . Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build . During the 12th century , new designs began to be introduced - in France , quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced , while in England polygonal towers were built . By the end of the century , French and English keep designs began to diverge : Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories , while in England castles were built without keeps . In Spain , keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles , although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion . In the second half of the 14th century , there was a resurgence in the building of keeps . In France , the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall , heavily machicolated designs , a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design . Meanwhile , tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles : these large keeps , each uniquely designed , formed part of the grandest castles built during the period . In the 15th century , the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery .",
  "/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses": "The Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars for control of the throne of England fought between supporters of two rival cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet : the House of Lancaster , represented by a red rose , and the House of York , represented by a white rose . Eventually , the wars eliminated the male lines of both families . The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487 , but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties . The power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the Hundred Years ' War , unfolding the structural problems of bastard feudalism , combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King Henry VI which revived interest in the House of York 's claim to the throne by Richard of York . Historians disagree on which of these factors was the main reason for the wars . With the Duke of York 's death in 1460 , the claim transferred to his heir , Edward . After a series of Yorkist victories from January-February 1461 , Edward claimed the throne on 4 March 1461 , and the last serious Lancastrian resistance ended at the decisive Battle of Towton . Edward was thus unopposed as the first Yorkist king of England , as Edward IV . Resistance smouldered in the North of England until 1464 , but the early part of his reign remained relatively peaceful . A new phase of the wars broke out in 1469 after the Earl of Warwick , the most powerful noble in the country , withdrew his support for Edward and threw it behind the Lancastrian cause . Fortunes changed many times as the Yorkist and Lancastrian forces exchanged victories throughout 1469-70 ( and Edward was even captured for a time in 1469 ) . When Edward fled to Flanders in 1470 , Henry VI was re-installed as king on 3 October 1470 , but his resumption of rule was short-lived , and he was deposed again following the defeat of his forces at the Battle of Tewkesbury , and on 21 May 1471 , Edward entered London unopposed , resumed the throne , and probably had Henry killed that same day .",

It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

In the United Kingdom , the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural , historical or cultural significance ; Grade I structures are those considered to be buildings of exceptional interest . In England , the authority for listing under the Planning ( Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas ) Act 1990 rests with Historic England , a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport . The metropolitan county of Greater Manchester is made up of 10 metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Manchester , Oldham , Rochdale , Salford , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford and Wigan . The Grade I buildings in each borough are listed separately . Manchester , the world 's first industrialised city , has 15 of Greater Manchester 's 45 Grade I listed buildings , the highest number of any borough . Oldham is the only borough to have no listed buildings with a Grade I rating . The River Irwell forms the boundary between Manchester and Salford , so one listed structure , the railway bridge over the Irwell , has been listed under both Manchester and Salford . Most of Greater Manchester 's listed buildings date from the Victorian and Edwardian periods . According to an Association for Industrial Archaeology publication , Greater Manchester is one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain , the result of a combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries : a phenomenal rise in population , the appearance of the specialist industrial town , a transport revolution , and weak local lordship . Much of the region , historically a part of Lancashire , was at the forefront of textile manufacturing from the early 19th century until the early 20th century , and the county includes several former mill towns .

Historically part of Lancashire , Rochdale 's recorded history begins with an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 under Recedham Manor . The ancient parish of Rochdale was a division of the hundred of Salford and one of the largest ecclesiastical parishes in England , comprising several townships . By 1251 , Rochdale had become important enough to have been granted a Royal charter . Rochdale flourished into a centre of northern England 's woollen trade , and by the early 18th century was described as being remarkable for many wealthy merchants . Rochdale rose to prominence in the 19th century as a mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the first industrialised towns . The Rochdale Canal - one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom - was a highway of commerce during this time used for the haulage of cotton , wool and coal to and from the area . The socioeconomic change brought by the success of Rochdale 's textile industry in the 19th century led to its rise to borough status and it remained a dominant settlement in its region .

  "/wiki/Norman_Conquest": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",
  "/wiki/Defensive_wall": "A defensive wall is a fortification usually used to protect a city , town or other settlement from potential aggressors . The walls can be simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers , bastions and gates to access to the city . In ancient to modern times , they were used to enclose settlements . Generally , these are referred to as city walls or town walls , although there were also walls , such as the Great Wall of China , Walls of Benin , Hadrian 's Wall , Anastasian Wall , the Cyclopean Wall Rajgir and the metaphorical Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries . In mountainous terrain , defensive walls such as letzis were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack . Beyond their defensive utility , many walls also had important symbolic functions - representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced . Existing ancient walls are almost always masonry structures , although brick and timber-built variants are also known . Depending on the topography of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect , elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective . Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate city gate and are often supplemented with towers . The practice of building these massive walls , though having its origins in prehistory , was refined during the rise of city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe . Simpler defensive walls of earth or stone , thrown up around hillforts , ringworks , early castles and the like , tend to be referred to as ramparts or banks .",

The start of the Mersey is at the confluence of the River Tame and River Goyt in Stockport . It flows westwards through the suburban areas of south Manchester , then into the Manchester Ship Canal at Irlam , becoming a part of the canal and maintaining the canal 's water levels . After 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) the river exits the canal , flowing towards Warrington where the river widens . It then narrows as it passes between the towns of Runcorn and Widnes . From Runcorn the river widens into a large estuary , which is 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) across at its widest point near Ellesmere Port . The course of the river then turns north as the estuary narrows between Liverpool and Birkenhead on the Wirral Peninsula to the west , and empties into Liverpool Bay . In total the river flows 70.33 miles ( 113 km ) . A railway tunnel between Birkenhead and Liverpool as part of the Mersey Railway opened in 1886 .
