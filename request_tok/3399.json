  "/wiki/Margaret_Beckett": "Dame Margaret Mary Beckett DBE PC MP ( n\u00e9e Jackson ; born 15 January 1943 ) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Derby South since 1983 . She was the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party under John Smith from 1992 to 1994 , and briefly served as interim Leader of the Labour Party after Smith died suddenly . She later served in the Cabinet under Prime Minister Tony Blair in a number of roles , becoming Britain 's first female Foreign Secretary in 2006 . Beckett was first elected to Parliament in October 1974 for Lincoln and held junior positions in the governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan . She lost her seat in 1979 , but returned to the House of Commons in 1983 , this time representing Derby South . She was appointed to Neil Kinnock 's Shadow Cabinet shortly afterwards , being elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1992 , becoming the first woman to hold that role . When John Smith died in 1994 , she became the first woman to lead the Labour Party , although Tony Blair won the election to replace Smith shortly afterwards to assume the substantive leadership . After Labour returned to power in 1997 , Beckett became a member of Tony Blair 's Cabinet initially as President of the Board of Trade . She was later the Leader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , before becoming Foreign Secretary in 2006 , the first woman to hold that position , and - after Margaret Thatcher - the second woman to hold one of the Great Offices of State . Following Blair 's resignation as Prime Minister in 2007 , Beckett was not initially given a position by new Prime Minister Gordon Brown . After some time , Brown appointed her Minister of State for Housing and Planning in 2008 , before she left the government for the last time in 2009 . Beckett holds the record for the female MP with the longest service overall ( Harriet Harman has longer continuous service ) and is one of the few sitting MPs who served in the Labour governments of the 1970s .",
