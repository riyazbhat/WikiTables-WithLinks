The docks were formerly part of the Port of London , at one time the world 's largest port . After the docks closed , the area had become derelict and poverty-ridden by the 1980s .

The name London Docklands was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971 and has since been almost universally adopted . The redevelopment created wealth , but also led to some conflict between the new and old communities in the area .",
