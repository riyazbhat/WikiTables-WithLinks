Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3 % of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves",
  "/wiki/Outer_space": "Outer space , or simply space , is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between celestial bodies . Outer space is not completely empty - it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles , predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium , as well as electromagnetic radiation , magnetic fields , neutrinos , dust , and cosmic rays . The baseline temperature of outer space , as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang , is 2.7 kelvins ( \u2212270.45 \u00b0C ; \u2212454.81 \u00b0F ) . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic ( ordinary ) matter in the universe ; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins . Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies . Studies indicate that 90 % of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form , called dark matter , which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces . Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy , a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood . Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe , but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space . Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth 's surface . However , the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , an altitude of 100 km ( 62 mi ) above sea level , is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping . The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty , which entered into force on 10 October 1967 . This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space",

  "/wiki/De_Beers": "De Beers Group is an international corporation that specialises in diamond exploration , diamond mining , diamond retail , diamond trading and industrial diamond manufacturing sectors . The company is currently active in open-pit , large-scale alluvial , coastal and deep sea mining . It operates in 35 countries and mining takes place in Botswana , Namibia , South Africa , Canada and Australia . From its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century , De Beers controlled 80 % to 85 % of rough diamond distribution and was accused of being a monopoly . Competition has since dismantled the complete monopoly , though the De Beers Group still sells approximately 35 % of the world 's rough diamond production through its global sightholder and auction sales businesses . The company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes , who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild & Sons bank . In 1926 , Ernest Oppenheimer , an immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American plc with American financier J.P. Morgan , was elected to the board of De Beers . He built and consolidated the company 's global monopoly over the diamond industry until his death in 1957 . During this time , he was involved in a number of controversies , including price fixing and trust behaviour , and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the U.S. war effort during World War II . In 2011 , Anglo American took control of De Beers after buying the Oppenheimer 's family stake of 40 percent for US $ 5.1 billion ( \u00a33.2 billion ) and increasing its stake to 85 percent , ending the 80-year Oppenheimer control of the company . In 2018 , De Beers became the first diamond company to announce that it would track its diamonds using blockchain technology , though this technology has not yet been rolled out",
