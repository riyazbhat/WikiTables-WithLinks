  "/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union": "The European Union ( EU ) consists of 27 member states . Each member state is party to the founding treaties of the union and thereby shares in the privileges and obligations of membership . Unlike members of most international organisations , the member states of the EU have agreed by treaty to shared sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some ( but by no means all ) aspects of government . Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt some policies ; for others , collective decision making is by qualified majority voting . Subsidiarity , meaning that decisions are taking collectively if and only if they can not realistically be taken individually , is a founding principle of the EU . In 1957 , six core states founded the EU 's predecessor , the European Economic Community ( Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany ) . The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements . To accede , a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria , which require a candidate to have a democratic , free-market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions , and respect for the rule of law . Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate 's adoption of the existing body of EU law , known as the acquis communautaire . Until 2020 , no member state had withdrawn or been suspended from the EU , though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas had previously left . The UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 2017 to formally initiate the Brexit process . Completion occurred on 31 January 2020 ( London time ) , with all other arrangements remaining in place during a transition period while a free trade agreement is negotiated",
