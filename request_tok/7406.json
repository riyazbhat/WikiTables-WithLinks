In 1845 , the first football laws were written by pupils at Rugby School ; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C . to leave the Football Association in 1863 and , in 1895 , the acrimonious split between the then amateur rugby union and the professional rugby league .

Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century .

  "/wiki/First-class_cricket": "First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket . A first-class match is of three or more days ' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams . Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although , in practice , a team might play only one innings or none at all . First-class cricket ( which for this purpose includes all important matches played before 1895 ) , along with historical single-wicket and the modern limited-overs forms of List A and Twenty20 , is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket . The origin of the term first-class cricket is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status , effective in 1895 , following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894 . Subsequently , at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) in May 1947 , it was formally defined on a global basis . A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively . This has left historians , and especially statisticians , with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches , especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain . The solution put forward by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ( ACS ) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches . Test cricket , the highest standard of cricket , is statistically a form of first-class cricket , though the term first-class is mainly used to refer to domestic competition . A player 's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches .",

The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
