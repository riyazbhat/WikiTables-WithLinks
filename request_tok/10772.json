  "/wiki/Plagiarism": "Plagiarism is the wrongful appropriation and stealing and publication of another author 's language , thoughts , ideas , or expressions [ citation needed ] and the representation of them as one 's own original work . Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics . It is subject to sanctions such as penalties , suspension , expulsion from school or work , substantial fines and even incarceration . Recently , cases of extreme plagiarism have been identified in academia . The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century , particularly with the Romantic movement . Plagiarism is not in itself a crime , but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement , violation of moral rights , or torts . In academia and industry , it is a serious ethical offense . Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent , but they are not equivalent concepts , and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement , which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts . Plagiarism might not be the same in all countries . Some countries like India and Poland consider plagiarism to be a crime , and there have been cases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing . In other instances plagiarism might be the complete opposite of academic dishonesty , in fact some counties find the act of plagiarizing a professional 's work flattering . Students who move to the United States from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon often find the transition difficult .",

He was a United States Senator for 13 years . In national politics , he was a Democrat . Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment , which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office . However , his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen 's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War .

He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial . The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston , yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee ; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party , however , proved decisive . Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill , a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South , which figured in the Compromise of 1877 .
