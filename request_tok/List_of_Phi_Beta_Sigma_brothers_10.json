The first game was played on January 15 , 1967 after both leagues had completed their respective 1966 seasons . After the merger , each league was re-designated as a conference , and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL 's league champion .

  "/wiki/All-Pro": "All-Pro is an honor bestowed upon professional American football players that designates the best player at each position during a given season . All-Pro players are typically selected by press organizations , who select an All-Pro team , a list that consists of at least 22 players , one for each offensive and defensive position , plus various special teams players depending on the press organization that compiles the list . All-Pro lists are exclusively limited to the major leagues , usually only the National Football League ; in the past , other leagues recognized as major , such as the American Football League of the 1960s or the All-America Football Conference of the 1940s , have been included in All-Pro lists . Beginning in the early 1920s , All-Pro teams have traditionally been assembled from press polls of individually voting sportswriters . After polling the writers , the votes are tallied to determine the selected players and the results have historically been published through various news syndicates . Today , the teams are mostly published online or announced on various televised sports programs . Some organizations publish two All-Pro lists , a First Team and a Second Team , with the first consisting of more prominent players than the second . The Associated Press ( AP ) and its All-Pro selections are the most widely recognized today . Other polls include the United Press International All-Pro poll , which began in the 1940s and continued in various forms until 1997 , the Newspaper Enterprise Association All-Pro team , which ran from 1954 until 1996 , and the Pro Football Writers Association All-Pro teams , which were inaugurated in 1966 and continue to be released annually . The NFL itself compiled official All-Pro lists beginning in 1931 but abandoned the practice in 1942 . The All-Pro designation , while not officially sanctioned by the NFL , is generally considered a more prestigious honor than the NFL 's official all-star designation , a Pro Bowl recognition : a minimum of twice as many Pro Bowlers are selected as first and second team All-Pro slots combined , and Pro Bowl selections often drop out , allowing a lesser player to also receive the honor by default , which does not occur with the All-Pro list .",
  "/wiki/Pro_Bowl": "The Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League ( NFL ) . From the merger with the rival American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 up through 2013 and since 2017 , it is officially called the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl , matching the top players in the American Football Conference ( AFC ) against those in the National Football Conference ( NFC ) . From 2014 through 2016 , the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format , where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains ( who are each in the Hall of Fame ) , instead of selecting players from each conference . The players were picked in a televised schoolyard pick prior to the game . Unlike most major sports leagues , which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their regular seasons , the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season . The first official Pro Bowl was played in January 1951 , three weeks after the 1950 NFL Championship Game ( between 1939 and 1942 , the NFL experimented with all-star games pitting the league 's champion against a team of all-stars ) . Between 1970 and 2009 , the Pro Bowl was usually held the weekend after the Super Bowl . Since 2010 , it has been played the weekend before the Super Bowl . Players from the two teams competing in the Super Bowl do not participate . For years , the game has suffered from lack of interest due to perceived low quality , with observers and commentators expressing their disfavor with it in its current state . It draws lower TV ratings than regular season NFL games , although the game draws similar ratings to other major all-star games , such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game .
