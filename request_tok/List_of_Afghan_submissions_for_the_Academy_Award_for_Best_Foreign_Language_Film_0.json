Dari is the term officially recognized and promoted since 1964 by the Afghan government for the Persian language , hence , it is also known as Afghan Persian in many Western sources . This has resulted in a naming dispute . Many Persian speakers in Afghanistan prefer and use the name Farsi and say the term Dari has been forced on them by the dominant Pashtun ethnic group as an attempt to distance Afghans from their cultural , linguistic and historical ties to the Persian-speaking nations , which includes Iran and Tajikistan . As defined in the Constitution of Afghanistan , it is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan ; the other is Pashto . Dari is the most widely spoken language in Afghanistan and the native language of approximately 27-50 % of the population . However Dari Persian serves as the lingua franca of the country and is understood by up to 80 % of the population . Iranian Persian and Dari Persian are mutually intelligible , with differences found primarily in the vocabulary and phonology . By way of Early New Persian , Dari Persian , like Iranian Persian and Tajik , is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sassanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , the language of the Achaemenids ( 550-330 BC ) . In historical usage , Dari refers to the Middle Persian court language of the Sassanids",
  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states",

Several challenges were faced by the filmmakers , with regards to the poppy field , before filming was completed .

  "/wiki/Persian_language": "Persian ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r\u0292\u0259n , -\u0283\u0259n/ ) , also known by its endonym Farsi ( \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc , f\u0101rsi , [ f\u0252\u02d0\u027e\u02c8si\u02d0 ] ( listen ) ) , is a Western Iranian language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian subdivision of the Indo-European languages . It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi",
