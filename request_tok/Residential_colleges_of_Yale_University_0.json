  "/wiki/Berkeley_College_(Yale_University)": "Berkeley College is a residential college at Yale University , opened in 1934 . The eighth of Yale 's 14 residential colleges , it was named in honor of Reverend George Berkeley ( 1685-1753 ) , dean of Derry and later bishop of Cloyne , in recognition of the assistance in land and books that he gave to Yale in the 18th century . Built on the site of a group of buildings known from the 1890s until 1933 as the Berkeley Oval , the college was renovated in 1998",
  "/wiki/George_Berkeley": "George Berkeley ( /\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0rkli/ ; 12 March 1685 - 14 January 1753 ) - known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ) - was an Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called immaterialism ( later referred to as subjective idealism by others ) . This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers and , as a result , can not exist without being perceived . Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism . In 1709 , Berkeley published his first major work , An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects , but light and colour . This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work , A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge , in 1710 , which , after its poor reception , he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713 . In this book , Berkeley 's views were represented by Philonous ( Greek : lover of mind ) , while Hylas ( Greek : matter ) embodies the Irish thinker 's opponents , in particular John Locke . Berkeley argued against Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu ( On Motion ) , published 1721 . His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein . In 1732 , he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734 , he published The Analyst , a critique of the foundations of calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics . Interest in Berkeley 's work increased after World War II because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century , such as the problems of perception , the difference between primary and secondary qualities , and the importance of language",
  "/wiki/Collegiate_Gothic": "Collegiate Gothic is an architectural style subgenre of Gothic Revival architecture , popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for college and high school buildings in the United States and Canada , and to a certain extent Europe . A form of historicist architecture , it took its inspiration from English Tudor and Gothic buildings . It has returned in the 21st century in the form of prominent new buildings at schools and universities including Princeton and Yale . Ralph Adams Cram , arguably the leading Gothic Revival architect and theoretician in the early 20th century , wrote about the appeal of the Gothic for educational facilities in his book Gothic Quest : Through architecture and its allied arts we have the power to bend men and sway them as few have who depended on the spoken word .

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece",

  "/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)": "Jonathan Edwards ( October 5 , 1703 - March 22 , 1758 ) was a North American revivalist preacher , philosopher , and Congregationalist Protestant theologian . Edwards is widely regarded as one of the America 's most important and original philosophical theologians . Edwards ' theological work is broad in scope , but he was rooted in Reformed theology , the metaphysics of theological determinism , and the Puritan heritage . Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life 's work on conceptions of beauty , harmony , and ethical fittingness , and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset . Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening , and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733-35 at his church in Northampton , Massachusetts . His theological work gave rise to a distinct school of theology known as the New England theology . Edwards delivered the sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God , a classic of early American literature , during another revival in 1741 , following George Whitefield 's tour of the Thirteen Colonies . Edwards is well known for his many books , The End For Which God Created the World , The Life of David Brainerd , which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century , and Religious Affections , which many Reformed Evangelicals still read today .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958",
