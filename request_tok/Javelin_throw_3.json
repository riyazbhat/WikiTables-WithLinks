He is the only athlete to throw a javelin 100 metres or more , with his world record of 104.80 m ( 343 ft 9 3\u20444 in ) . A new javelin design was implemented in 1986 and the records had to be restarted , thus Hohn 's mark became an eternal world record . Born in Neuruppin , Hohn excelled at the javelin throw from a young age and won the 1981 European Junior Championship with a throw of 86.56 m , a junior record . He then won gold at the 1982 European Championships with a 91.34 m throw . He did not compete at the 1983 World Championships and missed out on the 1984 Summer Olympics as East Germany had boycotted the games . He did however win gold at the Friendship Games , throwing 94.44 m ( Arto H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen won the 1984 Olympics with a throw of 86.76 m ) . In 1985 , Hohn won the IAAF World Cup and European Cup but his career ended in 1986 after several setbacks due to a surgery .

Its 3,748,148 ( 2018 ) inhabitants make it the most populous city proper of the European Union . The city is one of Germany 's 16 federal states . It is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg , and contiguous with Potsdam , Brandenburg 's capital . The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region , which is , with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000 km\u00b2 , Germany 's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions . Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree , which flows into the River Havel ( a tributary of the River Elbe ) in the western borough of Spandau . Among the city 's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree , Havel , and Dahme rivers ( the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee ) . Due to its location in the European Plain , Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate . About one-third of the city 's area is composed of forests , parks , gardens , rivers , canals and lakes . The city lies in the Central German dialect area , the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects . First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes , Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg ( 1417-1701 ) , the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1701-1918 ) , the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) , the Weimar Republic ( 1919-1933 ) , and the Third Reich ( 1933-1945 ) .

  "/wiki/Ferenc_Paragi": "Ferenc Paragi ( 21 August 1953 - 21 April 2016 ) was a Hungarian athlete who , on 23 April 1980 established a world record of 96.72 meters in the javelin throw , eclipsing the global standard set by fellow countryman Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal . This effort added more than two meters to the previous world record , fueling discussion and speculation regarding the likelihood of alterations to the javelin 's design and flight characteristics . Proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986 , following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record ; the first coming in 1983 , when Tom Petranoff , then of the United States , added precisely three meters to Paragi 's mark , and the other in 1984 , when East German Uwe Hohn launched the 800 gram implement to 104.80 meters . Hohn 's mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed , and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change . Indeed , the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings , which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal , most famously in the high-profile case at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the eventual winner Dainis K\u016bla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw . Ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately , compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot . Paragi also competed at the Moscow Olympics . Even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 96.20 on 18 May 1980 , there could be no question he was among the leading favorites . However , he had problems in the qualifying round , languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a sub-standard mark of 72.60 , but saved himself by throwing 88.76 with his third and final attempt - the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters . Next day in the final however , he could do no better than 79.52 and finished in tenth place . His qualification performance would have been enough for a bronze . Paragi was the Hungarian champion for 5 years",

The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour .

A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz",

The javelin competition at the 1972 Games was the closest in Olympic history . Germany 's Klaus Wolfermann had taken the lead from L\u016bsis in the fifth round with an Olympic Record throw of 90.48 meters . Then , in the sixth and final round , L\u016bsis let fly with a very long effort that measured at 90.46 meters - Wolfermann 's two centimeter margin was , at the time , the smallest unit of measurement used in javelin competitions . As of 2003 [ update ] , he remains the only Latvian who has won a complete set of Olympic medals . L\u016bsis set two world records in javelin throw , of 91.68m in 1968 and of 93.80 m in 1972 . He is also a 4-times European champion . In 1987 IAAF nominated him as the all-time greatest javelin thrower in the world . After L\u016bsis finished competing , he became an athletics coach",

Kiev is an important industrial , scientific , educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe . It is home to many high-tech industries , higher education institutions , and historical landmarks . The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure , including the Kiev Metro . The city 's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi , one of its four legendary founders . During its history , Kiev , one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe , passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity . The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century . A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople , Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars , until its capture by the Varangians ( Vikings ) in the mid-9th century . Under Varangian rule , the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus ' , the first East Slavic state . Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240 , the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come"
