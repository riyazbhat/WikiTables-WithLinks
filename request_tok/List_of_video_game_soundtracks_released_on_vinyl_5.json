Sometimes , a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks , coordinates the production , manufacture , distribution , marketing , promotion , and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos , while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ( artists and repertoire or A & R ) , and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers .

After nearly a decade , EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013 , whereupon it became a bestseller . The fandom also spun-out other enterprises . When Nintendo did not release a localized version of Mother 3 , fans organized their own fan translation .
