  "/wiki/North_Atlantic_current": "The North Atlantic Current ( NAC ) , also known as North Atlantic Drift and North Atlantic Sea Movement , is a powerful warm western boundary current within the Atlantic Ocean that extends the Gulf Stream northeastward . The NAC originates from where the Gulf Stream turns north at the Southeast Newfoundland Rise , a submarine ridge that stretches southeast from the Grand Banks . The NAC flows northward east of the Grand Banks , from 40\u00b0N to 51\u00b0N , before turning sharply east to cross the Atlantic . It transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current ; more than 40 Sv in the south and 20 Sv as it crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge . It reaches speeds of 2 knots near the North American coast . Directed by topography , the NAC meanders heavily , but in contrast to the meanders of the Gulf Stream , the NAC meanders remain stable without breaking off into eddies . The colder parts of the Gulf Stream turn northward near the tail of the Grand Banks at 50\u00b0W where the Azores Current branches off to flow south of the Azores . From there the NAC flows northeastward , east of the Flemish Cap ( 47\u00b0N , 45\u00b0W ) . Approaching the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , it then turns eastward and becomes much broader and more diffuse . It then splits into a colder northeastern branch and a warmer eastern branch . As the warmer branch turns southward , most of the subtropical component of the Gulf Stream is diverted southward , and as a consequence , the North Atlantic is mostly supplied by subpolar waters , including a contribution from the Labrador Current recirculated into the NAC at 45\u00b0N . West of Continental Europe , it splits into two major branches .",
  "/wiki/Permafrost": "In geology , permafrost is ground , including rock or ( cryotic ) soil , with a temperature that remains at or below the freezing point of water 0 \u00b0C ( 32 \u00b0F ) for two or more years . Most permafrost is located in high latitudes ( in and around the Arctic and Antarctic regions ) , but at lower latitudes alpine permafrost occurs at higher elevations . Ground ice is not always present , as may be in the case of non-porous bedrock , but it frequently occurs , and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material . Permafrost accounts for 0.022% of total water on Earth , and the permafrost region covers 24% of exposed land in the Northern Hemisphere . It also occurs subsea on the continental shelves of the continents surrounding the Arctic Ocean , portions of which were exposed during the last glacial period . The thawing of permafrost has implications for the global climate . A global temperature rise of 1.5 \u00b0C ( 2.7 \u00b0F ) above current levels would be enough to start the thawing of permafrost in Siberia , according to one group of scientists .",

  "/wiki/Oyashio_Current": "Oyashio ( \u89aa\u6f6e , Parental Tide ) , also known as Oya Siwo , Okhostk or the Kurile current , is a cold subarctic ocean current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise in the western North Pacific Ocean . The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the Arctic Ocean and flow southward via the Bering Sea , passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk . It collides with the Kuroshio Current off the eastern shore of Japan to form the North Pacific Current ( or Drift ) . The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the parent ( \u89aa , oya ) that provides for and nurtures marine organisms . The current has an important impact on the climate of the Russian Far East , mainly in Kamchatka and Chukotka , where the northern limit of tree growth is moved south up to ten degrees compared with the latitude it can reach in inland Siberia . The waters of the Oyashio Current form probably the richest fishery in the world owing to the extremely high-nutrient content of the cold water and the very high tides ( up to ten metres ) in some areas - which further enhances the availability of nutrients . However , the Oyashio Current also causes Vladivostok to be the most equatorward port to seasonally freeze and require icebreaking ships to remain open in winter . Nonetheless , this has relatively little effect on the fish yield through the Sea of Okhotsk , because the large tides mean freezing does not occur so easily . During glacial periods , when lower sea level exposed the Bering land bridge , the current could not flow in the regions the Oyashio affects today . The level of cooling with the onset of glacial conditions ( after an interglacial ) was much less than in other areas of the Earth at similar latitudes . This allowed T\u014dhoku and Hokkaid\u014d - the only areas of East Asia with enough snowfall to potentially form glaciers - to remain unglaciated except at high elevations during periods when Europe and North America were largely glaciated . This lack of glaciation explains why , despite its present climate being much colder than most of Europe , East Asia has retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera , whereas Europe has retained only 27% .",
