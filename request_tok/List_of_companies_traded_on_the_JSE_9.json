  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) . This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device .",
  "/wiki/Telecommunication": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_cable": "An electrical cable is an assembly of one or more wires running side by side or bundled , which is used to carry electric current . A cable assembly is the composition of one or more electrical cables and their corresponding connectors . A cable assembly is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product ( e.g . to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with a connector mounted to the housing ) . Cable assemblies can also take the form of a cable tree or cable harness , used to connect many terminals together .",
  "/wiki/Security": "Security is freedom from , or resilience against , potential harm ( or other unwanted coercive change ) caused by others . Beneficiaries ( technically referents ) of security may be of persons and social groups , objects and institutions , ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change .",
  "/wiki/JCI_Limited": "JCI or Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co. Ltd. was founded in 1889 by the British entrepreneur Barney Barnato . JCI was a major force in South African mining for over 100 years . Using his investments in the Kimberley diamond fields , particularly his 25% share in De Beers , Barnato foresaw the value of and invested in the potential of the Witwatersrand gold mines . At first he bought small but rich mines near Germiston - the New Primrose , named after his daughter , and others in the same region . In 1913 JCI bought the Randfontein Estates Gold Mining Company , which was a fabulously rich mine , from Sir J.B. Robinson . At the peak of its production Randfontein was equipped with 600 stamp mills , the roar of which could be heard in Johannesburg . Randfontein Estates was an extraordinarily rich mining property , and in the 1950s was a pioneer of uranium production . During the 1930s Randfontein was the largest gold producer in South Africa , if not the world . JCI was also involved with numerous mining ventures - New State Mines at Brakpan , Modder Deep Mines at Benoni , Van Dyk Mines at Benoni . In the 1960s Randfontein was virtually closed down , and mining was developed at Western Areas on the other side of the shallow valley , but in the 1970s new deposits were discovered to the south of Randfontein and the Cooke Section was opened up in 1976 . Cooke produced gold and uranium , the uranium being destined for the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station fuel . In addition to the gold mines , 25% of De Beers and a controlling interest in Rustenburg Platinum Holdings , the world 's largest platinum producer , JCI owned large industrial and property holdings , including the Houghton Estate in northern Johannesburg , and substantial shareholdings in South African Breweries , Toyota South Africa , Lennings Industrial , etc. , and was long a target of developers who lusted after the property holdings .",

  "/wiki/Mass_market": "The term mass market refers to a market for goods produced on a large scale for a significant number of end consumers . The mass market differs from the niche market in that the former focuses on consumers with a wide variety of backgrounds with no identifiable preferences and expectations in a large market segment . Traditionally , businesses reach out to the mass market with advertising messages through a variety of media including radio , TV , newspapers and the Web .",
  "/wiki/High_tech": "High technology , or high tech ( sometimes also called frontier technology or frontier tech ) , is technology that is at the cutting edge : the most advanced technology available . The opposite of high tech is low technology , referring to simple , often traditional or mechanical technology ; for example , a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device . The phrase was used in a 1958 The New York Times story advocating atomic energy for Europe : . Western Europe , with its dense population and its high technology . Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969 : Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio ] controls a score of high technology patents in a variety of fields . and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form , high tech . A widely used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the OECD . It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD countries , resulting in four distinct categories . Startups working on high technologies ( or developing new high technologies ) are sometimes referred to as deep tech .",
  "/wiki/Biotechnology": "Biotechnology is the broad area of biology , involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products , or any technological application that uses biological systems , living organisms , or derivatives thereof , to make or modify products or processes for specific use ( UN Convention on Biological Diversity , Art . 2 ) . Depending on the tools and applications , it often overlaps with the ( related ) fields of molecular biology , bio-engineering , biomedical engineering , biomanufacturing , molecular engineering , etc . Biotechnology does not involve DNA editing as it is part of the new branch CRISPR which was recently found by Osaka University researcher Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues in 1987 . For thousands of years , humankind has used biotechnology in agriculture , food production , environment and medicine . The term is largely believed to have been coined in 1919 by Hungarian engineer K\u00e1roly Ereky . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences such as genomics , recombinant gene techniques , applied immunology , and development of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic tests .",
  "/wiki/Stem_cell": "Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into other types of cells , and can also divide in self-renewal to produce more of the same type of stem cells . Telomerase is active in normal stem cells . In mammals , there are two broad types of stem cells : embryonic stem cells , which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts in early embryonic development , and adult stem cells , which are found in various tissues of fully developed mammals . In adult organisms , stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body , replenishing adult tissues . In a developing embryo , stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells - ectoderm , endoderm and mesoderm ( see induced pluripotent stem cells ) - but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs , such as blood , skin , or intestinal tissues . There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans : bone marrow , adipose tissue , and blood . Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth . Of all stem cell therapy types , autologous harvesting involves the least risk . Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies ( e.g. , bone marrow transplantation ) . Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed ( differentiated ) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves . Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer or dedifferentiation have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies . Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport": "Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle , using multiple modes of transportation ( e.g. , rail , ship , and truck ) , without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes . The method reduces cargo handling , and so improves security , reduces damage and loss , and allows freight to be transported faster . Reduced costs over road trucking is the key benefit for inter-continental use . This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances .",
  "/wiki/Infrastructure": "Infrastructure is the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country , city , or other area , including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function . Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads , railways , bridges , tunnels , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , and telecommunications ( including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds ) . In general , it has also been defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions .",

  "/wiki/Avusa": "Tiso Blackstar Group is a media company in South Africa , formerly known as Johnnic Communications , Avusa and Times Media Group . Avusa means to rouse feelings , to revive and evoke action . The name was changed in 2007 in order to avoid confusion between Johnnic Communications and Johnnic Holdings . The name was changed again ( to Tiso Blackstar ) in 2017 . In 2012 , Avusa was acquired by a unit of Mvelaphanda Group and renamed Times Media Group , which was then relisted on the JSE . In 2013 , Times Media Group acquired the remaining 50% of BDFM from Pearson .",
  "/wiki/Newspaper": "A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background . Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics , business , sports and art , and often include materials such as opinion columns , weather forecasts , reviews of local services , obituaries , birth notices , crosswords , editorial cartoons , comic strips , and advice columns . Most newspapers are businesses , and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue , newsstand sales , and advertising revenue . The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers . Newspapers have traditionally been published in print ( usually on cheap , low-grade paper called newsprint ) . However , today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers , and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely . Newspapers developed in the 17th century , as information sheets for merchants . By the early 19th century , many cities in Europe , as well as North and South America , published newspapers . Some newspapers with high editorial independence , high journalism quality , and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record .",

  "/wiki/Mass_media": "Mass media refers to a diverse array of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication . The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets . Broadcast media transmit information electronically via media such as films , radio , recorded music , or television . Digital media comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication . Internet media comprise such services as email , social media sites , websites , and Internet-based radio and television . Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web , by such means as linking to or running TV ads online , or distributing QR Codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website . In this way , they can use the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords , as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently . Outdoor media transmit information via such media as AR advertising ; billboards ; blimps ; flying billboards ( signs in tow of airplanes ) ; placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses , commercial buildings , shops , sports stadiums , subway cars , or trains ; signs ; or skywriting . Print media transmit information via physical objects , such as books , comics , magazines , newspapers , or pamphlets . Event organizing and public speaking can also be considered forms of mass media . The organizations that control these technologies , such as movie studios , publishing companies , and radio and television stations , are also known as the mass media .

  "/wiki/Entertainment": "Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight . It can be an idea or a task , but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience 's attention . Although people 's attention is held by different things , because individuals have different preferences in entertainment , most forms are recognisable and familiar . Storytelling , music , drama , dance , and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures , were supported in royal courts , developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens . The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products . Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale , ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products ; to a banquet adapted for two ; to any size or type of party , with appropriate music and dance ; to performances intended for thousands ; and even for a global audience . The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement , so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter , although many entertainments have a serious purpose . This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony , celebration , religious festival , or satire for example . Hence , there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth . An important aspect of entertainment is the audience , which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment . The audience may have a passive role , as in the case of persons watching a play , opera , television show , or film ; or the audience role may be active , as in the case of games , where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed . Entertainment can be public or private , involving formal , scripted performance , as in the case of theatre or concerts ; or unscripted and spontaneous , as in the case of children 's games .",

  "/wiki/Platinum": "Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78 . It is a dense , malleable , ductile , highly unreactive , precious , silverish-white transition metal . Its name is derived from the Spanish term platino , meaning little silver . Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements . It has six naturally occurring isotopes . It is one of the rarer elements in Earth 's crust , with an average abundance of approximately 5 \u03bcg/kg . It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in South Africa , which accounts for 80% of the world production . Because of its scarcity in Earth 's crust , only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , and given its important uses , it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity . Platinum is one of the least reactive metals . It has remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and is therefore considered a noble metal . Consequently , platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum . Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers , it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts .",
  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2% nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite .",
  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) . Copper is sometimes used in decorative art , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments . Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents , fungicides , and wood preservatives .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products ."
