The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 . In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled , five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida . Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station . The Shuttle fleet 's total mission time was 1322 days , 19 hours , 21 minutes and 23 seconds . Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",

  "/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States": "Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States , currently used by 29 states , the federal government , and the military . Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies . The United States is the only developed Western nation that applies the death penalty regularly . It is one of 54 countries worldwide applying it , and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution , which has since been adopted by five other countries . The Philippines has since abolished executions , and Guatemala has done so for civil offenses , leaving the United States as one of four countries to still use this method ( along with China , Thailand , and Vietnam ) . There were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977 . In 1972 , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia , reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment . Subsequently , a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes , and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia . Since then , more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death ; of these , more than 1,500 have been executed . A total of 165 who were sentenced to death in the modern era were exonerated before their execution . As of December 17 , 2019 , 2,656 are still on death row .

  "/wiki/Rickets": "Rickets is a condition that results in weak or soft bones in children . Symptoms include bowed legs , stunted growth , bone pain , large forehead , and trouble sleeping . Complications may include bone fractures , muscle spasms , an abnormally curved spine , or intellectual disability . The most common cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency . This can result from eating a diet without enough vitamin D , dark skin , too little sun exposure , exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation , celiac disease , and certain genetic conditions . Other factors may include not enough calcium or phosphorus . The underlying mechanism involves insufficient calcification of the growth plate . Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding a low calcium , low phosphorus , and a high alkaline phosphatase together with X-rays . Prevention for exclusively breastfed babies is vitamin D supplements . Otherwise , treatment depends on the underlying cause . If due to a lack of vitamin D , treatment is usually with vitamin D and calcium . This generally results in improvements within a few weeks ."
