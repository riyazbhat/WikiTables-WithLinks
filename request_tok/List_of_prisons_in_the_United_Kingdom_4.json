  "/wiki/HM_Prison_Aberdeen": "HM Prison Aberdeen ( formerly known as Craiginches ) was a medium-security prison , located in the city of Aberdeen , Scotland . The prison was managed by the Scottish Prison Service . Known as one of the most overcrowded prisons in Scotland , it had a design capacity of 155 and was contracted to hold up to 230 prisoners . However , on the first day of an inspection in January 2009 it held 264 prisoners . In 2014 , it was closed in favour of the new HMP Grampian . In its latter years it saw an increase in inmates from outside the Grampian Sheriffdom , mainly from Wolverhampton and London . The diverse population led to many internal feuds and disputes . It ran exceptional drug rehabilitation programmes and was a pioneer for drug projects such as drug use kits etc . The management also wished to pilot a needle exchange programme . In August 2007 Aberdeen Prison was chosen to pilot a new initiative called the Substance Related Offending Behaviour Program ( SROBP ) piloted by Officers Graeme Robson and Allan Dewar which looked at prisoners finding the relationship between their substance use and their offending behaviour . This programme has been very successful in reducing rates of recidivism . Aberdeen Prison was also recognised for its investment in in-house Bereavement Counseling services facilitated by Graeme Robson and Wayne Lawson .",

During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 . In 2015 , Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain .",
