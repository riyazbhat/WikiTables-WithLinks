It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto )",

Its members have a combined area of 4,233,255.3 km2 ( 1,634,469.0 sq mi ) and an estimated total population of about 447 million . The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters , and only those matters , where members have agreed to act as one . EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people , goods , services and capital within the internal market , enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries and regional development . For travel within the Schengen Area , passport controls have been abolished . A monetary union was established in 1999 , coming into full force in 2002 , and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency . The EU and European citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993 . The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , established , respectively , by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome . The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six : Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany . The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit . The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU , the Treaty of Lisbon , came into force in 2009 . In January 2020 , the United Kingdom became the first member state ever to leave the EU",

The IEA was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of oil , as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international oil market and other energy sectors . The IEA acts as a policy adviser to its member states , but also works with non-member countries , especially China , India , and Russia . The Agency 's mandate has broadened to focus on the 3Es of effectual energy policy : energy security , economic development , and environmental protection . The latter has focused on mitigating climate change . The IEA has a broad role in promoting alternate energy sources ( including renewable energy ) , rational energy policies , and multinational energy technology co-operation . IEA member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year 's net imports . At the end of July 2009 , IEA member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion barrels ( 680,000,000 m3 ) of oil . On 1 September 2015 , Fatih Birol took office as the new Executive Director , succeeding in this position former Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs , Maria van der Hoeven . The IEA has been strongly criticised for having consistently highly inaccurate forecasts of both fossil fuel and renewable energy . Fossil fuel predictions have been criticised as being highly optimistic , and estimates of renewable energy deployment were consistently found to be extremely pessimistic . Some renewable predictions were reached more than fifteen years early , with estimates being off by almost five thousand percent over five years",

Although Iran is one of the world 's largest producers of petroleum , rapid increases in demand and limited refining capacity has forced the country to import about 40 % of its gasoline , at an annual cost of up to USD $ 7 billion . The fuel rationing originally triggered discontent in Iran , but , according to analysts quoted in the Western news media , the Iranian government is hoping that reducing gasoline imports will help insulate the country from international pressure related to its nuclear program . We will greatly suffer if they ( foreign countries ) suddenly decide not to sell us fuel , said Iranian political analyst Saeed Leylaz . Fuel rationing is a security-economic decision to reduce fuel consumption . In an interview Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said : They [ Americans ] had a plan and idea that is neutralized . They do n't know our nation . They think if they refuse to provide us with gasoline , our nation would say we do n't want nuclear energy",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council .

Based on data from BP , at the end of 2009 , proved gas reserves were dominated by three countries : Iran , Russia , and Qatar , which together held nearly half the world 's proven reserves . There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves . Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA ( 47.6 trillion cubic meters ) , the US Energy Information Administration ( 49 tcm ) , and OPEC ( 48.81 tcm ) . However , BP credits Russia with only 32.9 tcm , which would place it in second place , slightly behind Iran ( 33.1 to 33.8 tcm , depending on the source ) . Due to constant announcements of shale gas recoverable reserves , as well as drilling in Central Asia , South America and Africa , deepwater drilling , estimates are undergoing frequent updates , mostly increasing .

It has the world 's second largest reserves after Russia . As it takes approximately 5,850 cubic feet ( 166 m3 ) of gas to equal the energy content of 1-barrel ( 0.16 m3 ) of oil , Iran 's gas reserves represent the equivalent of about 205 billion barrels ( 3.26\u00d71010 m3 ) of oil . The US Energy Information Administration estimated Iran 's proved gas reserves as of 2016 to be 1,201 trillion cubic feet ( 34.0 trillion cubic metres ) , rendering it second in the world . Iran is one of the most hydrocarbon-rich areas in the world . Since the nation 's first oil well in 1908 , 145 hydrocarbon fields and 297 oil and gas reservoirs have been discovered in Iran , with many fields having multiple pay zones . A total of 102 fields are oil and the remaining 43 are gas , and there are 205 oil reservoirs and 92 natural gas reservoirs . According to Iran Energy Balance Sheet ( 2009 , in Persian ) , 78 of these fields are currently active , with 62 onshore and 16 offshore , leaving 67 fields inactive at present . Some 23 hydrocarbon fields lie in border areas and are shared between Iran and adjacent countries , including Kuwait , Iraq , Qatar , Bahrain , UAE , Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan . The Permo-Triassic successions ( the Dehram group in Iran and its lateral equivalent , the Khuff formation ) , are major gas-producing intervals in these basins . The supergiant North Dome/South Pars field alone is estimated to hold about 19 % of the world 's total gas reserves , producing gas and condensate from these intervals . Iran still has huge potential for new significant gas discoveries : areas such as Caspian Sea , North East , Central Kavir and especially areas starting from Aghar and Dalan gas fields in Fars province up to the Strait of Hormuz [ citation needed ] and Central Persian Gulf have considerable potential for undiscovered gas",
  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material",

Natural gas is a fossil fuel formed from plant matter over the course of millions of years . It is a finite resource and thus considered to be a non-renewable energy source . The concept of peak gas follows from Hubbert peak theory , which is most commonly associated with peak oil . Hubbert saw gas , coal and oil as natural resources , each of which would peak in production and eventually run out for a region , a country , or the world . Since Hubbert 's initial predictions in 1956 , the proper application of ever more powerful statistical techniques has reduced much of the uncertainty about the supply of oil and natural gas .

Proven reserves are those quantities of petroleum which , by analysis of geological and engineering data , can be estimated , with a high degree of confidence , to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions . Some statistics on this page are disputed and controversial . Different sources ( OPEC , CIA World Factbook , oil companies ) give different figures . Some of the differences reflect different types of oil included . Different estimates may or may not include oil shale , mined oil sands or natural gas liquids . Because proven reserves include oil recoverable under current economic conditions , nations may see large increases in proven reserves when known , but previously uneconomic deposits become economic to develop . In this way , Canada 's proven reserves increased suddenly in 2003 when the oil sands of Alberta were seen to be economically viable .

  "/wiki/Oil_reserves": "Oil reserves denote the amount of crude oil that can be technically recovered at a cost that is financially feasible at the present price of oil . Hence reserves will change with the price , unlike oil resources , which include all oil that can be technically recovered at any price . Reserves may be for a well , a reservoir , a field , a nation , or the world . Different classifications of reserves are related to their degree of certainty . The total estimated amount of oil in an oil reservoir , including both producible and non-producible oil , is called oil in place . However , because of reservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies , only a fraction of this oil can be brought to the surface , and it is only this producible fraction that is considered to be reserves . The ratio of reserves to the total amount of oil in a particular reservoir is called the recovery factor . Determining a recovery factor for a given field depends on several features of the operation , including method of oil recovery used and technological developments . Based on data from OPEC at the beginning of 2013 the highest proved oil reserves including non-conventional oil deposits are in Venezuela ( 20 % of global reserves ) , Saudi Arabia ( 18 % of global reserves ) , Canada ( 13 % of global reserves ) , and Iran ( 9 % ) . Because the geology of the subsurface can not be examined directly , indirect techniques must be used to estimate the size and recoverability of the resource . While new technologies have increased the accuracy of these techniques , significant uncertainties still remain . In general , most early estimates of the reserves of an oil field are conservative and tend to grow with time",

  "/wiki/Reserves-to-production_ratio": "The reserves-to-production ratio ( RPR or R/P ) is the remaining amount of a non-renewable resource , expressed in time . While applicable to all natural resources , the RPR is most commonly applied to fossil fuels , particularly petroleum and natural gas . The reserve portion ( numerator ) of the ratio is the amount of a resource known to exist in an area and to be economically recoverable ( proven reserves ) . The production portion ( denominator ) of the ratio is the amount of resource produced in one year at the current rate . RPR = ( amount of known resource ) / ( amount used per year ) This ratio is used by companies and government agencies in forecasting the future availability of a resource to determine project life , future income , employment , etc. , and to determine whether more exploration must be undertaken to ensure continued supply of the resource . Annual production of a resource can usually be calculated to quite an accurate number . However , reserve quantities can only be estimated to varying degrees of accuracy , depending on the availability of information and on the methods used to evaluate them . A simplistic interpretation of the ratio has led to many false predictions of imminent running out of oil since the early years of the oil industry in the 1800s . This has been especially true in the United States , where the ratio of proved reserves-to-production has been between 8 years and 17 years since 1920 .
