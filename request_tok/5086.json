From the fragments of unordered scenes left by B\u00fcchner , Berg selected 15 to form a compact structure of three acts with five scenes each . He adapted the libretto himself , retaining the essential character of the play , with its many short scenes , its abrupt and sometimes brutal language , and its stark , if haunted , realism ... The plot depicts the everyday lives of soldiers and the townspeople of a rural German-speaking town . Prominent themes of militarism , callousness , social exploitation , and casual sadism are brutally and uncompromisingly presented . Toward the end of act 1 , scene 2 , the title character ( Wozzeck ) murmurs , Still , all is still , as if the world died , with his fellow soldier Andres muttering , Night ! We must get back ! seemingly oblivious to Wozzeck 's words . A funeral march begins , only to transform into the upbeat song of the military marching band in the next scene .",
