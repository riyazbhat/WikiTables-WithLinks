  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person , place , or thing after whom or after which something is named , or believed to be named , or the thing so named . The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic .

As a pioneer of contemporary Indigenous Australian art , he was the most famous Indigenous Australian of his generation . Born and raised at the Hermannsburg Lutheran Mission outside Alice Springs , Namatjira showed interest in art from an early age , but it was not until 1934 ( aged 32 ) , under the tutelage of Rex Battarbee , that he began to paint seriously . Namatjira 's richly detailed , Western art-influenced watercolours of the outback departed significantly from the abstract designs and symbols of traditional Aboriginal art , and inspired the Hermannsburg School of painting . He became a household name in Australia and reproductions of his works hung in many homes throughout the nation . As the first prominent Aboriginal artist to work in a western idiom , at the time he was widely regarded as representative of successful assimilation policies . Namatjira was the first Northern Territory Aboriginal person to be freed from restrictions that made Aboriginal people wards of the State . In 1957 , he became the first Aboriginal person to be granted restricted Australian citizenship , which allowed him to vote , have limited land rights and buy alcohol . In 1956 his portrait , by William Dargie , became the first of an Aboriginal person to win the Archibald Prize . Namatjira was also awarded the Queen 's Coronation Medal in 1953 , and was honoured with an Australian postage stamp in 1968 .",

The Hopi Reservation covers a land area of 2,531.773 sq mi ( 6,557.26 km2 ) . The Hopi encountered Spaniards in the 16th century , and are historically referred to as Pueblo people , because they lived in villages ( pueblos in the Spanish language ) .

They lived along the Mogollon Rim , especially from the 12th-14th century , after which time their cultures seemed to have disappeared . The name Hopi is a shortened form of their autonym , Hopituh Shi-nu-mu ( The Peaceful People or Peaceful Little Ones ) . The Hopi Dictionary gives the primary meaning of the word Hopi as : behaving one , one who is mannered , civilized , peaceable , polite , who adheres to the Hopi Way .",

He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971 . Neruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a Senator for the Chilean Communist Party . When President Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla outlawed communism in Chile in 1948 , a warrant was issued for Neruda 's arrest . Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the port city of Valpara\u00edso ; Neruda escaped through a mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina . Years later , Neruda was a close advisor to Chile 's socialist President Salvador Allende . When Neruda returned to Chile after his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , Allende invited him to read at the Estadio Nacional before 70,000 people . Neruda was hospitalised with cancer in September 1973 , at the time of the coup d'\u00e9tat led by Augusto Pinochet that overthrew Allende 's government , but returned home after a few days when he suspected a doctor of injecting him with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him on Pinochet 's orders . Neruda died in his house in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973 , just hours after leaving the hospital . Although it was long reported that he died of heart failure , the Interior Ministry of the Chilean government issued a statement in 2015 acknowledging a Ministry document indicating the government 's official position that it was clearly possible and highly likely that Neruda was killed as a result of the intervention of third parties . Pinochet , backed by elements of the armed forces , denied permission for Neruda 's funeral to be made a public event , but thousands of grieving Chileans disobeyed the curfew and crowded the streets .",
