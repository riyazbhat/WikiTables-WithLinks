  "/wiki/The_Topper_(comics)": "The Topper was a UK comic published by D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd that ran from 7 February 1953 to 15 September 1990 , when it merged with The Beezer . A strip named Mickey the Monkey originally appeared on the front cover . In the early 1970s , it was replaced by Send for Kelly , by Danny 's Tranny in 1975 , and Tricky Dicky in 1979 . Beryl the Peril took over on 24 May 1986 , and remained there until the merger with The Beezer . Unlike most other comics at the time , which were half tabloid size , the Topper was for many years full tabloid . It changed to A4 in 1980 , one year before The Beezer . Two comics were merged into The Topper during its run : these were Buzz in 1975 and Sparky in issue 1276 ( 16 July 1977 ) . In issue 1260 on 26 March 1977 , Big News was announced on the front cover redirecting the reader to page 7 of the comic . The announcement was that starting from issue number 1261 the comic would include a Special Pull-out section that brought back classic Topper Characters such as Splodge and Big Uggy . These lasted until issue 1276 , when the pull out section was used for the Sparky comic , creating the Special Sparky Pull-Out . The Sparky Pull out section was continued until the change to the A4 format . The Topper also produced an annual collection , The Topper Book",
  "/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_(UK)": "Dennis and Gnasher ( previously titled Dennis the Menace and Gnasher , and originally titled Dennis the Menace ) is a long-running comic strip in the British children 's comic The Beano , published by DC Thomson , of Dundee , Scotland . The comic stars a boy named Dennis the Menace and his Abyssinian wire-haired tripe hound Gnasher . The strip first appeared in issue 452 , dated 17 March 1951 ( on sale 12 March 1951 ) , and is the longest-running strip in the comic . The idea and name of the character emerged when the comic 's editor heard a British music hall song with the chorus I 'm Dennis the Menace from Venice . The creation of Dennis in the 1950s saw sales of The Beano soar . From issue 1678 onwards ( dated 14 September 1974 ) Dennis the Menace replaced Biffo the Bear on the front cover , and has been there ever since . Coincidentally , on 12 March 1951 , another comic strip named Dennis the Menace debuted in the US . As a result of this , the US series has initially been retitled Dennis for UK audiences , while the British character 's appearances are often titled Dennis and Gnasher outside the UK . Dennis is the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy . The main recurring storyline throughout the years features his campaign of terror against a gang of 'softies ' ( effeminate , well-behaved boys ) , particularly Walter . Walter finds himself in unfavourable circumstances on many occasions , although he sometimes gets the last laugh . Author Michael Rosen states , In most children 's books a bad child gets made good - but the great thing about Dennis is he never gets better",
