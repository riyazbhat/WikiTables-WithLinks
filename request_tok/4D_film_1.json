  "/wiki/Anaglyph_3D": "Anaglyph 3D is the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye 's image using filters of different ( usually chromatically opposite ) colors , typically red and cyan . Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images , one for each eye . When viewed through the color-coded anaglyph glasses , each of the two images reaches the eye it 's intended for , revealing an integrated stereoscopic image . The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into the perception of a three-dimensional scene or composition . Anaglyph images have seen a recent resurgence due to the presentation of images and video on the Web , Blu-ray Discs , CDs , and even in print . Low cost paper frames or plastic-framed glasses hold accurate color filters that typically , after 2002 , make use of all 3 primary colors . The current norm is red and cyan , with red being used for the left channel . The cheaper filter material used in the monochromatic past dictated red and blue for convenience and cost . There is a material improvement of full color images , with the cyan filter , especially for accurate skin tones . Video games , theatrical films , and DVDs can be shown in the anaglyph 3D process . Practical images , for science or design , where depth perception is useful , include the presentation of full scale and microscopic stereographic images .
