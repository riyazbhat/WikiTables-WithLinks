Major general ranks above brigadier general and below lieutenant general . [ Note 1 ] A major general typically commands division-sized units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers . Major general is equivalent to the two-star rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard , and is the highest permanent peacetime rank in the uniformed services . Higher ranks are technically temporary and linked to specific positions , although virtually all officers promoted to those ranks are approved to retire at their highest earned rank .",
  "/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War": "The Spanish-American War ( Spanish : Guerra Hispano-Americana ; Filipino : Digmaang Espanyol-Amerikano ) was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898 . Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba , leading to U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence . The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region , and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain 's Pacific possessions . That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine-American War . The main issue was Cuban independence . Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule . The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish-American War . There had been war scares before , as in the Virginius Affair in 1873 , but in the late 1890s , American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities . The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains . It lobbied vigorously against going to war . President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated yellow press and sought a peaceful settlement . The United States Navy armored cruiser USS Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor ; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

Each year , a number of Army colonels and lieutenant colonels are considered by a board for admission . Approximately 800 students attend at any one time , half in a two-year-long distance learning program , and the other half in an on-campus , full-time resident program lasting ten months . Upon completion , the college grants its graduates a master 's degree in Strategic Studies . Army applicants must have already completed the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College , the required Professional Military Education for officers in the rank of major . While the Army handpicks most of the students who participate in the residential program , the student body always includes officers from the other military branches , civilians from agencies such as the Department of Defense , State Department , and National Security Agency , and officers from foreign countries who attend the program as International Fellows . For example , the residential Class of 2017 had 381 students : 218 active component officers and 61 reserve component officers from all five branches of the United States Armed Forces , 28 senior federal government civilians , and 74 International Fellows . Majors with the specialty of Function Area 59 , Strategist , formerly Strategic Plans and Policy , also attend their qualification course , the Basic Strategic Arts Program ( BSAP ) , at the college .

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

  "/wiki/John_J._Pershing": "General of the Armies John Joseph Black Jack Pershing ( September 13 , 1860 - July 15 , 1948 ) GCB was a senior United States Army officer . His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) on the Western Front in World War I , 1917-18 . Pershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies , and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command , although some American divisions fought under British command , and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the French army . Pershing 's soldiers first saw serious battle at Cantigny , Chateau-Thierry , Belleau Wood , and Soissons . To speed up the arrival of American troops , they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind , and used British and French tanks , artillery , airplanes and other munitions . In September 1918 at St. Mihiel , the First Army was directly under Pershing 's command ; it overwhelmed the salient - the encroachment into Allied territory - that the German Army had held for three years . For the Meuse-Argonne Offensive , Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne , keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days , alongside the French . The Allied Hundred Days Offensive , which the Argonne fighting was part of , contributed to Germany calling for an armistice . Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of Germany should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism . Pershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to General of the Armies rank , the highest possible rank in the United States Army . [ Notes 1 ] Allowed to select his own insignia , Pershing chose to use four gold stars to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of General , which was signified with four silver stars . After the creation of the five-star General of the Army rank during World War II , his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a six-star general , but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted on by Congress .",

While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution , the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection . The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain , ending the Spanish-American War . Fighting erupted between forces of the United States and those of the Philippine Republic on February 4 , 1899 , in what became known as the 1899 Battle of Manila . On June 2 , 1899 , the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States . The war officially ended on July 2 , 1902 , with a victory for the United States . However , some Philippine groups - led by veterans of the Katipunan , a Philippine revolutionary society - continued to battle the American forces for several more years . Among those leaders was General Macario Sakay , a veteran Katipunan member who assumed the presidency of the proclaimed Tagalog Republic , formed in 1902 after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo . Other groups , including the Moro , Bicol , and Pulahan peoples , continued hostilities in remote areas and islands , until their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15 , 1913 . The war resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 Filipino civilians , mostly due to famine and disease . Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million . The war , and especially the following occupation by the U.S. , changed the culture of the islands , leading to the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines as a state religion , and the introduction of English to the islands as the primary language of government , education , business , industry , and , in future decades , among upper-class families and educated individuals .",

The expedition was launched in retaliation for Villa 's attack on the town of Columbus , New Mexico , and was the most remembered event of the Mexican Border War . The declared objective of the expedition by the Wilson administration was the capture of Villa . Despite successfully locating and defeating the main body of Villa 's command , responsible for the raid on Columbus , U.S. forces were unable to achieve Wilson 's stated main objective of preventing Villa 's escape . The active search for Villa ended after a month in the field when troops sent by Venustiano Carranza , the head of the Constitutionalist faction of the revolution and now the head of the Mexican government , resisted the U.S. incursion . The Constitutionalist forces used arms at the town of Parral to resist passage of a U.S. Army column . The U.S. mission was changed to prevent further attacks on it by Mexican troops and to plan for war in the eventuality it broke out . When war was averted diplomatically , the expedition remained in Mexico until February 1917 to encourage Carranza 's government to pursue Villa and prevent further raids across the border .",

The goal of the administration was to eliminate cut throat competition by bringing industry , labor , and government together to create codes of fair practices and set prices . The NRA was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act ( NIRA ) and allowed industries to get together and write codes of fair competition . The codes intended both to reduce destructive competition and help workers to set minimum wages and maximum weekly hours , as well as minimum prices at which products could be sold . The NRA also had a two-year renewal charter and was set to expire in June 1935 if not renewed . The NRA , symbolized by the Blue Eagle , was popular with workers . Businesses that supported the NRA put the symbol in their shop windows and on their packages , though they did not always go along with the regulations entailed . Though membership to the NRA was voluntary , businesses that did not display the eagle were very often boycotted , making it seem mandatory for survival to many . In 1935 , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously declared that the NRA law was unconstitutional , ruling that it infringed the separation of powers under the United States Constitution .

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Mihiel": "The Battle of Saint-Mihiel was a major World War I battle fought from 12-15 September 1918 , involving the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) and 110,000 French troops under the command of General John J. Pershing of the United States against German positions . The U.S. Army Air Service played a significant role in this action . This battle marked the first use of the terms D-Day and H-Hour by the Americans . The attack at the Saint-Mihiel salient was part of a plan by Pershing in which he hoped that the Americans would break through the German lines and capture the fortified city of Metz . It was the first and only offensive launched mainly by the United States Army in World War I , and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating . This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack , coming up against disorganized German forces , proved more successful than expected . The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces , and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move . The U.S. attack faltered as artillery and food supplies were left behind on the muddy roads . The attack on Metz was not realized , as the Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch ordered the American troops to march towards Sedan and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res , which would lead to the Meuse-Argonne Offensive .",
  "/wiki/Meuse-Argonne_Offensive": "The Meuse-Argonne offensive ( also known as the Meuse River-Argonne Forest offensive , the Battles of the Meuse-Argonne , and the Meuse-Argonne campaign ) was a major part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front .

The Meuse-Argonne offensive was the largest in United States military history , involving 1.2 million American soldiers . It is the second deadliest battle in American history , resulting in over 350,000 casualties including 28,000 German lives , 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives . U.S. losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops , the tactics used during the early phases of the operation and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the Spanish Flu . Meuse-Argonne was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) during World War I . It was one of a series of Allied attacks known as the Hundred Days Offensive , which brought the war to an end . It was the largest and bloodiest operation of World War I for the AEF even if , given the scale of other battles on the Western Front , its size was limited and the operation itself secondary as it was far from the main offensive axis .",

For service not related to actual war , the term duty of a great responsibility applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war , and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement .

Awards may be made to persons other than members of the United States Armed Forces for wartime services only , and then only under exceptional circumstances , with the express approval of the president in each case ."
