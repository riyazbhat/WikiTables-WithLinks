Until 1972 , when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area , it extended ( by way of Stockton , the Altamont Pass , and the Bay Bridge ) to San Francisco , near the Pacific Ocean . The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route . It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40 . The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States , with the section through Nevada known as The Loneliest Road in America . In the Midwest , US 50 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Cincinnati , Ohio . The route continues into the eastern United States , where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington , D.C. From there , US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City . Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles ( 4,946 km ) , but the actual distance is slightly less , due to realignments since the former figure was measured . US 50 passes through a total of 12 states ; California , Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia , Virginia , and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia . US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system . The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth , Nevada , east to Annapolis , Maryland , along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway , Midland Trail , and the National Old Trails Road . The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento , California , east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to US 6 in the 1950s",
