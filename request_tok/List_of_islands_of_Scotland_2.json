  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",
  "/wiki/Ailsa_Craig": "Ailsa Craig ( /\u02c8e\u026als\u0259/ ; Scottish Gaelic : Creag Ealasaid ) is an island of 99 hectares ( 240 acres ) in the outer Firth of Clyde , 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) west of mainland Scotland , upon which blue hone granite has long been quarried to make curling stones . The now uninhabited island is formed from the volcanic plug of an extinct volcano . The island , colloquially known as Paddy 's milestone , was a haven for Catholics during the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century , but is today a bird sanctuary , providing a home for huge numbers of gannets and an increasing number of puffins .",
  "/wiki/Islands_of_the_Clyde": "The Islands of the Firth of Clyde are the fifth largest of the major Scottish island groups after the Inner and Outer Hebrides , Orkney and Shetland . They are situated in the Firth of Clyde between Ayrshire and Argyll and Bute . There are about forty islands and skerries , of which only four are inhabited and only nine larger than 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) . [ Note 1 ] The largest and most populous are Arran and Bute , and Great Cumbrae and Holy Island are also served by dedicated ferry routes . Unlike the four larger Scottish archipelagos , none of the isles in this group are connected to one another or to the mainland by bridges . The geology and geomorphology of the area is complex and the islands and the surrounding sea lochs each have distinctive features . The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Drift create a mild , damp oceanic climate . The larger islands have been continuously inhabited since Neolithic times , were influenced by the emergence of the kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata from 500 AD and then absorbed into the emerging Kingdom of Alba under Kenneth MacAlpin . They experienced Viking incursions during the Early Middle Ages and then became part of the Kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century . There is a diversity of wildlife , including three species of rare endemic tree .",
  "/wiki/Isle_of_Arran": "The Isle of Arran ( /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259n/ ; Scottish Gaelic : Eilean Arainn ) or simply Arran is an island off the coast of Scotland . It is the largest island in the Firth of Clyde and the seventh largest Scottish island , at 432 square kilometres ( 167 sq mi ) . Historically part of Buteshire , it is in the unitary council area of North Ayrshire . In the 2011 census it had a resident population of 4,629 . Though culturally and physically similar to the Hebrides , it is separated from them by the Kintyre peninsula . Often referred to as Scotland in Miniature , the island is divided into highland and lowland areas by the Highland Boundary Fault and has been described as a geologist 's paradise . Arran has been continuously inhabited since the early Neolithic period . Numerous prehistoric remains have been found . From the 6th century onwards , Goidelic-speaking peoples from Ireland colonised it and it became a centre of religious activity . In the troubled Viking Age , Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown , until formally absorbed by the kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century . The 19th-century clearances led to significant depopulation and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life . The economy and population have recovered in recent years , the main industry being tourism .",

  "/wiki/Orkney": "Orkney /\u02c8\u0254\u02d0rkni/ ( Old Norse : Orkneyjar ) , also known as the Orkney Islands , [ Notes 1 ] is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland , situated off the north coast of the island of Great Britain . Orkney is 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of the coast of Caithness and has about 70 islands , of which 20 are inhabited . The largest island , Mainland , is often referred to as the Mainland , and has an area of 523 square kilometres ( 202 sq mi ) , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles . The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall . Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , a constituency of the Scottish Parliament , a lieutenancy area , and a historic county . The local council is Orkney Islands Council , one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents . [ Notes 2 ] The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years , originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts . Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark . In addition to the Mainland , most of the remaining islands are in two groups , the North and South Isles , all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone . The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile , most of the land being farmed . Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy .",
  "/wiki/Baleshare": "Baleshare ( Scottish Gaelic : Baile Sear ) is a flat tidal island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . Baleshare lies to the south-west of North Uist . Its economics and community were boosted by the building of a causeway in 1962 . The 350 m ( 380 yd ) causeway was built by William Tawse Ltd . The island is extremely flat by Hebridean standards , rising to only 12 metres ( 39 feet ) above sea level and known for its long sandy beach . It has a population of 49 living in two settlements : Samhla and Teananachar . The name means 'east farm ' or 'east town ' . The 'west town ' may have been on land that was said to exist to the west of Baleshare , washed away in the sixteenth century , over which it was possible to walk to the Monach Islands at low tide . The Monachs are some 15 kilometres ( 9.3 miles ) to the west . Another story suggests there was once a land bridge to Kirkibost , 100 metres ( 330 feet ) to the north . The basis for this seems to be a reference in the Exchequer Rolls for 1542 that the valued rental had been decreased due to encroachment by the sea at some unspecified ( presumably recent ) date . Two prehistoric settlements have been uncovered , which contain the remains of a circular stone house and pieces of pottery , bone and metal .",

Three other islands ( D\u00f9n , Soay and Boreray ) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting . The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area . The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture . The islands ' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods , although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages . The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century , but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island 's evacuation in 1930 . The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations , including Michael Powell 's film The Edge of the World and an opera . Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia , the population probably never exceeding 180 ( and certainly no more than 100 after 1851 ) .
