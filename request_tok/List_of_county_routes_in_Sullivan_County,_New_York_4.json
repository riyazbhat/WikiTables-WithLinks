  "/wiki/NY_52": "New York State Route 52 ( NY 52 ) is a 108.72-mile-long ( 174.97 km ) state highway in the southeastern part of the state . It generally runs from west to east through five counties , beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg , crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge , and ending in Carmel . NY 52 and NY 55 , both major east-west routes of the Mid-Hudson Region , run parallel to each other , intersecting in downtown Liberty . With the exception of the section overlapping Interstate 84 ( I-84 ) , most of Route 52 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas . The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley , such as the villages of Jeffersonville , Ellenville and Walden . East of the Hudson , it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill . It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon , following a ferry between them , but since the bridge 's construction Route 52 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north . Much of what is today Route 52 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century . After their operating companies folded later in the century , the state took over the roads in the 1890s . While some portions of today 's Route 52 were included in New York 's first designations of state highways , it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route 52 took that number . At that time it followed most of its present alignment , but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22 . The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s , along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216",

  "/wiki/NY_42": "New York State Route 42 ( NY 42 ) is a north-south , discontinuous state highway in the Catskill Mountains region of New York in the United States . The southernmost of the highway 's two segments begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) and US 209 in Port Jervis and ends at a junction with NY 55 near the Rondout Reservoir in Neversink . NY 42 's northern segment runs from NY 28 in Shandaken to NY 23A in Lexington . The 41-mile ( 66 km ) southern segment is located in Orange County and Sullivan County , while the 11-mile ( 18 km ) northern segment is in Ulster County and Greene County . NY 42 is one of three state routes in New York that is split into two segments ; the others are NY 24 and NY 878 , both located on Long Island . Like NY 24 , NY 42 was a continuous route when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The portion of the route between Neversink and Shandaken was eliminated in the mid-1930s",

  "/wiki/NY_17": "New York State Route 17 ( NY 17 ) is a major state highway that extends for 397 miles ( 638.91 km ) through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway east through Corning to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury , where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern , where it connects to New Jersey Route 17 . From the Pennsylvania border to the village of Waverly and from Binghamton to Windsor , NY 17 is concurrent with Interstate 86 ( I-86 ) . Eventually , the entire east-west portion of NY 17 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed . At 397 miles , NY 17 is the longest state route in New York , and its second-longest highway of any kind besides the Thruway . It serves 11 counties ( Chautauqua , Cattaraugus , Allegany , Steuben , Chemung , Tioga , Broome , Delaware , Sullivan , Orange , and Rockland ) , passes through the cities of Salamanca , Olean , Corning , Elmira , and Binghamton , and enters the vicinity of several others , including Jamestown and Middletown . As it proceeds across the state , it intersects many of New York 's Interstate and U.S . Highways , including U.S. Route 219 ( US 219 ) in Salamanca , I-99 and US 15 near Corning , I-81 in Binghamton , and I-84 near Middletown . The portion of NY 17 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania ; however , it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . The route was assigned in 1924 , extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways . It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s . Two of NY 17 's suffixed routes , NY 17C and NY 17M , follow substantial portions of NY 17 's pre-freeway alignment",
