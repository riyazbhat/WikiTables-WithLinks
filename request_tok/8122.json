  "/wiki/New_Brunswick": "New Brunswick is one of four Atlantic provinces on the east coast of Canada . According to the Constitution of Canada , New Brunswick is the only bilingual province . About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones , and one third francophones . One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual . Atypically for Canada , only about half of the population lives in urban areas , mostly in Greater Moncton , Greater Saint John and the capital Fredericton . Unlike the other Maritime provinces , New Brunswick 's terrain is mostly forested uplands , with much of the land further from the coast , giving it a harsher climate . New Brunswick is 83 % forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city . The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly , reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century .",
