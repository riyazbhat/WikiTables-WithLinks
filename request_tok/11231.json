  "/wiki/Samhain": "Samhain ( /\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0w\u026an , \u02c8sa\u028a\u026an/ ; Irish : [ \u02c8s\u02e0\u0259u\u026an\u02b2 ] Scottish Gaelic : [ \u02c8s\u032a\u00e3\u0169.\u026a\u0272 ] ) is a Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the darker half of the year . Traditionally , it is celebrated from 31 October to 1 November , as the Celtic day began and ended at sunset . This is about halfway between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice . It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals , along with Imbolc , Bealtaine and Lughnasadh . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . Similar festivals are held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands , for example the Brittonic Calan Gaeaf ( in Wales ) , Kalan Gwav ( in Cornwall ) , and Kalan Goa\u00f1v ( in Brittany ) ; both Celtic branches are roughly as old as each other . Samhain is believed to have Celtic pagan origins and there is evidence it has been an important date since ancient times . Some Neolithic passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the time of Samhain . It is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain . It was the time when cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and when livestock were slaughtered for the winter . As at Bealtaine , special bonfires were lit , which were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers , and there were rituals involving them . Like Bealtaine , Samhain was seen as a liminal time , when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed .",
  "/wiki/Halloween": "Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of Hallows ' Even or Hallows ' Evening ) , also known as Allhalloween , All Hallows ' Eve , or All Saints ' Eve , is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ' Day . It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide , the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead , including saints ( hallows ) , martyrs , and all the faithful departed . It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals , particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain ; that such festivals may have had pagan roots ; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church . Some believe , however , that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday , separate from ancient festivals like Samhain . Halloween activities include trick-or-treating ( or the related guising and souling ) , attending Halloween costume parties , carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns , lighting bonfires , apple bobbing , divination games , playing pranks , visiting haunted attractions , telling scary stories , as well as watching horror films . In many parts of the world , the Christian religious observances of All Hallows ' Eve , including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead , remain popular , although elsewhere it is a more commercial and secular celebration . Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows ' Eve , a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day , including apples , potato pancakes , and soul cakes .",
  "/wiki/Celtic_polytheism": "Ancient Celtic religion , commonly known as Celtic paganism , comprises the religious beliefs and practices adhered to by the Iron Age people of Western Europe now known as the Celts , roughly between 500 BCE and 500 CE , spanning the La T\u00e8ne period and the Roman era , and in the case of the Insular Celts the British and Irish Iron Age . Very little is known with any certainty about the subject , and apart from documented names that are thought to be of deities , the only detailed contemporary accounts are by hostile and probably not-well-informed Roman writers .",
  "/wiki/Yule": "Yule or Yuletide ( Yule time or Yule season ) is a festival historically observed by the Germanic peoples . Scholars have connected the original celebrations of Yule to the Wild Hunt , the god Odin , and the pagan Anglo-Saxon M\u014ddraniht . Later departing from its pagan roots , Yule underwent Christianised reformulation , resulting in the term Christmastide . Many present-day Christmas customs and traditions such as the Yule log , Yule goat , Yule boar , Yule singing , and others stem from pagan Yule traditions . Terms with an etymological equivalent to Yule are still used in Nordic countries and Estonia to describe Christmas and other festivals occurring during the winter holiday season . Today , Yule is celebrated in Heathenry and other forms of Neopaganism , as well as in LaVeyan Satanism .",
  "/wiki/Germanic_paganism": "Germanic paganism refers to the ethnic religion practiced by the Germanic peoples from the Iron Age until Christianisation during the Middle Ages . It was an essential element of early Germanic culture . From both archaeological remains and literary sources , it is possible to trace a number of common or closely related beliefs amid the Germanic peoples into the Middle Ages , when the last areas in Scandinavia were Christianized . Rooted in Proto-Indo-European religion , Proto-Germanic religion expanded during the Migration Period , yielding extensions such as Old Norse religion among the North Germanic peoples , the paganism practiced amid the continental Germanic peoples , and Anglo-Saxon paganism among the Old English-speaking peoples . Germanic religion is best documented in several texts from the 10th and 11th centuries , where they have been best preserved in Scandinavia and Iceland .",
  "/wiki/Winter_solstice": "The winter solstice , hiemal solstice or hibernal solstice , also known as midwinter , occurs when one of the Earth 's poles has its maximum tilt away from the Sun . It happens twice yearly , once in each hemisphere ( Northern and Southern ) . For that hemisphere , the winter solstice is the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year , when the Sun is at its lowest daily maximum elevation in the sky . At the pole , there is continuous darkness or twilight around the winter solstice . Its opposite is the summer solstice . The winter solstice occurs during the hemisphere 's winter . In the Northern Hemisphere , this is the December solstice ( usually 21 or 22 December ) and in the Southern Hemisphere , this is the June solstice ( usually 20 or 21 June ) . Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment , the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs . Other names are midwinter , the extreme of winter ( Dongzhi ) , or the shortest day . Traditionally , in many temperate regions , the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter , but today in some countries and calendars , it is seen as the beginning of winter . In meteorology , winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice . Since prehistory , the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures , and has been marked by festivals and rituals .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86 % of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73 % ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25 % ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Imbolc": "Imbolc or Imbolg ( [ \u026a\u02c8m\u02e0\u0254l\u02e0\u0261 ] ) , also called ( Saint ) Brigid 's Day ( Irish : L\u00e1 Fh\u00e9ile Br\u00edde , Scottish Gaelic : L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde , Manx : Laa ' l Breeshey ) , is a Gaelic traditional festival marking the beginning of spring . It is held on 1 February , or about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals - along with Beltane , Lughnasadh and Samhain . For Christians , especially in Ireland , it is the feast day of Saint Brigid . Imbolc is mentioned in early Irish literature , and there is evidence suggesting it was also an important date in ancient times . It is believed that Imbolc was originally a pagan festival associated with the goddess Brigid , and that it was Christianized as a festival of Saint Brigid , who is thought to be a Christianization of the goddess . On Imbolc/St Brigid 's Day , Brigid 's crosses were made and a doll-like figure of Brigid ( a Br\u00edde\u00f3g ) would be paraded from house-to-house by girls , sometimes accompanied by 'strawboys ' . Brigid was said to visit one 's home at Imbolc . To receive her blessings , people would make a bed for Brigid and leave her food and drink , and items of clothing would be left outside for her to bless . Brigid was also invoked to protect homes and livestock . Special feasts were had , holy wells were visited , and it was a time for divination .",
  "/wiki/Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple": "The Presentation of Jesus at ( or in ) the Temple is an early episode in the life of Jesus , describing his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem in order to officially induct him into Judaism , that is celebrated by many Christian Churches on the holiday of Candlemas . It is described in the chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible . Within the account , Luke 's narration of the Presentation in the Temple combines the purification rite with the Jewish ceremony of the redemption of the firstborn ( Luke 2:23-24 ) . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Presentation of Jesus at the temple is celebrated as one of the twelve Great Feasts , and is sometimes called Hypapante ( \u1f59\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae , = Meeting in Greek ) . In Western Christianity , the additional name for the Service the day , Candlemas , is added . This Feast-day is also known as the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin or the Meeting of the Lord.In some liturgical churches , Vespers ( or Compline ) on the Feast of the Presentation marks the end of the Epiphany season , also ( since the 2018 lectionary ) in the Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland ( EKD ) . In the Church of England , the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion , the Presentation of Christ in the Temple is a Principal Feast celebrated either on 2 February or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February . In the Catholic Church , especially since the time of Pope Gelasius I ( 492-496 ) who in the fifth century contributed to its expansion , the Presentation is celebrated on 2 February and is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary . In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion , and the Lutheran Church , the episode was also reflected in the once-prevalent custom of churching new mothers forty days after the birth of a child .",
  "/wiki/Spring_(season)": "Spring , also known as springtime is one of the four temperate seasons , following winter and preceding summer . There are various technical definitions of spring , but local usage of the term varies according to local climate , cultures and customs . When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere , it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa . At the spring ( or vernal ) equinox , days and nights are approximately twelve hours long , with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses . Spring and springtime refer to the season , and also to ideas of rebirth , rejuvenation , renewal , resurrection and regrowth . Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons , e.g . dry or wet , monsoonal or cyclonic . Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe .",
  "/wiki/\u0112ostre": "\u0112ostre or Ostara ( Old English : \u0112astre [ \u00e6\u02d0\u0251str\u0259 ] or [ e\u02d0\u0251str\u0259 ] , Northumbrian dialect \u0112astro , Mercian dialect and West Saxon dialect ( Old English ) \u0112ostre [ e\u02d0ostr\u0259 ] ; Old High German : *\u00d4stara ) is a Germanic goddess who , by way of the Germanic month bearing her name ( Northumbrian : \u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe ; West Saxon : \u0112asterm\u014dna\u00fe ; Old High German : \u00d4starm\u00e2noth ) , is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages . \u0112ostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work The Reckoning of Time , where Bede states that during \u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe ( the equivalent of April ) , pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in \u0112ostre 's honour , but that this tradition had died out by his time , replaced by the Christian Paschal month , a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus . By way of linguistic reconstruction , the matter of a goddess called *Austr\u014d in the Proto-Germanic language has been examined in detail since the foundation of Germanic philology in the 19th century by scholar Jacob Grimm and others . As the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Indo-European ( PIE ) , historical linguists have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *H\u2082ews\u1e53s ( \u2192 *Aus\u1e53s ) , from which descends the Common Germanic divinity from whom \u0112ostre and Ostara are held to descend . Additionally , scholars have linked the goddess 's name to a variety of Germanic personal names , a series of location names ( toponyms ) in England , and , discovered in 1958 , over 150 inscriptions from the 2nd century CE referring to the matronae Austriahenae . Theories connecting \u0112ostre with records of Germanic Easter customs , including hares and eggs , have been proposed . Particularly prior to the discovery of the matronae Austriahenae and further developments in Indo-European studies , debate has occurred among some scholars about whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede . \u0112ostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of Germanic neopaganism .",
  "/wiki/Vernal_equinox": "The March equinox or Northward equinox is the equinox on the Earth when the subsolar point appears to leave the Southern Hemisphere and cross the celestial equator , heading northward as seen from Earth . The March equinox is known as the vernal equinox ( spring equinox ) in the Northern Hemisphere and as the autumnal equinox in the Southern . On the Gregorian calendar , the Northward equinox can occur as early as 19 March or as late as 21 March at Greenwich . For a common year the computed time slippage is about 5 hours 49 minutes later than the previous year , and for a leap year about 18 hours 11 minutes earlier than the previous year . Balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the March equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 March each year . The March equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of spring and the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere but marks the beginning of autumn and the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere . In astronomy , the March equinox is the zero point of sidereal time and , consequently , right ascension . It also serves as a reference for calendars and celebrations in many human cultures and religions .",

Rituals were performed to protect the cattle , crops and people , and to encourage growth . Special bonfires were kindled , and their flames , smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers . The people and their cattle would walk around or between bonfires , and sometimes leap over the flames or embers . All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire .

This feast commemorates the canonization of Saint Walpurga and the movement of her relics to Eichst\u00e4tt , both of which occurred on 1 May 870 . Saint Walpurga was hailed by the Christians of Germany for battling pest , rabies and whooping cough , as well as against witchcraft . Christians prayed to God through the intercession of Saint Walpurga in order to protect themselves from witchcraft , as Saint Walpurga was successful in converting the local populace to Christianity . In parts of Christendom , people continue to light bonfires on Saint Walpurga 's Eve in order to ward off evil spirits and witches . Others have historically made Christian pilgrimages to Saint Walburga 's tomb in Eichst\u00e4tt on the Feast of Saint Walburga , often obtaining vials of Saint Walburga 's oil . Local variants of Walpurgis Night are observed throughout Northern and Central Europe in the Netherlands , Germany , the Czech Republic , Slovenia , Sweden , Lithuania , Latvia , Finland , and Estonia .

  "/wiki/Fairy": "A fairy ( also fata , fay , fae , fair folk ; from faery , faerie , realm of the fays ) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature in European folklore ( and particularly Celtic , Slavic , German , English , and French folklore ) , a form of spirit , often described as metaphysical , supernatural , or preternatural . Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin , but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources . Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition , as minor deities in Pagan belief systems , as spirits of the dead , as prehistoric precursors to humans , or as elementals . The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance , small stature , magical powers , and a penchant for trickery . At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature , such as goblins and gnomes . Fairy has at times been used as an adjective , with a meaning equivalent to enchanted or magical . A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms . Common examples of such charms include church bells , wearing clothing inside out , four-leaf clover , and food . Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations , and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps . Before the advent of modern medicine , fairies were often blamed for sickness , particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities . In addition to their folkloric origins , fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art , and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras . The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage .",
  "/wiki/Midsummer": "Midsummer is the period of time centered upon the summer solstice , and more specifically the northern European celebrations that accompany the actual solstice or take place on a day between June 19 and June 25 and the preceding evening . The exact dates vary among different cultures . The celebration predates Christianity , and existed under different names and traditions around the world . The undivided Christian Church designated June 24 as the feast day of the early Christian martyr St John the Baptist , and the observance of St John 's Day begins the evening before , known as St John 's Eve . These are commemorated by many Christian denominations , such as the Roman Catholic Church , Lutheran Churches , and Anglican Communion , as well as by freemasonry . In Sweden , the Midsummer is such an important festivity that there have been proposals to make the Midsummer 's Eve into the National Day of Sweden , instead of June 6 . In Latvia Midsummer festival is National Day of Latvia . In Denmark and Norway , it may also be referred to as St. Hans Day .",
  "/wiki/Summer_solstice": "The summer solstice ( or estival solstice ) , also known as midsummer , occurs when one of the Earth 's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun . It happens twice yearly , once in each hemisphere ( Northern and Southern ) . For that hemisphere , the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky and is the day with the longest period of daylight . Within the Arctic circle ( for the northern hemisphere ) or Antarctic circle ( for the southern hemisphere ) , there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice . On the summer solstice , Earth 's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44\u00b0 . Likewise , the Sun 's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44\u00b0 . The summer solstice occurs during summer . This is the June solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the December solstice in the Southern Hemisphere . Depending on the shift of the calendar , the summer solstice occurs sometime between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and between December 20 and December 23 in the Southern Hemisphere . The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter solstice . Since prehistory , the summer solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures , and has been marked by festivals and rituals .

Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . In Modern Irish it is called L\u00fanasa , in Scottish Gaelic : L\u00f9nastal , and in Manx : Luanistyn . Traditionally it is held on 1 August , or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox . However , in recent centuries some of the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date . Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals , along with Samhain , Imbolc and Beltane . It corresponds to other European harvest festivals such as the Welsh G\u0175yl Awst and the English Lammas . Lughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and has pagan origins . The festival itself is named after the god Lugh . It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies , ritual athletic contests ( most notably the Tailteann Games ) , feasting , matchmaking and trading . There were also visits to holy wells . According to folklorist M\u00e1ire MacNeill , evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the 'First Fruits ' , a feast of the new food and of bilberries , the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play in which Lugh seizes the harvest for mankind and defeats the powers of blight .",
  "/wiki/Lammas": "Lammas Day ( Anglo-Saxon hlaf-mas , loaf-mass ) , is a holiday celebrated in some English-speaking countries in the Northern Hemisphere on 1 August . It is a festival to mark the annual wheat harvest , and is the first harvest festival of the year . On this day it was customary to bring to church a loaf made from the new crop , which began to be harvested at Lammastide , which falls at the halfway point between the summer solstice and autumn September equinox . The loaf was blessed , and in Anglo-Saxon England it might be employed afterwards in protective rituals : a book of Anglo-Saxon charms directed that the Lammas bread be broken into four bits , which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn , to protect the garnered grain . In many parts of England , tenants were bound to present freshly harvested wheat to their landlords on or before the first day of August . In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , where it is referred to regularly , it is called the feast of first fruits . The blessing of first fruits was performed annually in both the Eastern and Western Churches on the first or the sixth of August ( the latter being the feast of the Transfiguration of Christ ) . Lammas has coincided with the feast of St. Peter in Chains , commemorating St. Peter 's miraculous deliverance from prison , but in the liturgical reform of 1969 , the feast of St. Alphonsus Liguori was transferred to this day , the day of St. Alphonsus ' death .",

  "/wiki/Autumnal_equinox": "An equinox is commonly regarded as the instant of time when the plane ( extended indefinitely in all directions ) of Earth 's equator passes through the center of the Sun . This occurs twice each year , around 20 March and 23 September . In other words , it is the moment at which the center of the visible Sun is directly above the equator . The word is derived from the Latin aequinoctium , from aequus ( equal ) and nox ( genitive noctis ) ( night ) . On the day of an equinox , daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet . They are not exactly equal , however , due to the angular size of the Sun , atmospheric refraction , and the rapidly changing duration of the length of day that occurs at most latitudes around the equinoxes . Long before conceiving this equality , primitive equatorial cultures noted the day when the Sun rises due east and sets due west , and indeed this happens on the day closest to the astronomically defined event . In the Northern Hemisphere , the March equinox is called the vernal or spring equinox while the September equinox is called the autumnal or fall equinox . In the Southern Hemisphere , the reverse is true . The dates slightly vary due to leap years and other factors . Since the Moon ( and to a lesser extent the planets ) causes Earth 's orbit to slightly vary from a perfect ellipse , the equinox is officially defined by the Sun 's more regular ecliptic longitude rather than by its declination . The instants of the equinoxes are currently defined to be when the apparent geocentric longitude of the Sun is 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 ."
