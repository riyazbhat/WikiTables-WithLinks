MacArthur Foundation typically to between 20 and 30 individuals , working in any field , who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction and are citizens or residents of the United States . According to the foundation 's website , the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment , but rather an investment in a person 's originality , insight , and potential . The current prize is $ 625,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments . This figure was increased from $ 500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review of the MacArthur Fellows Program . Since 1981 , 942 people have been named MacArthur Fellows , ranging in age from 18 to 82 . The award has been called one of the most significant awards that is truly 'no strings attached ' . The program does not accept applications . Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people . The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the president and board of directors . Most new Fellows first learn of their nomination and award upon receiving a congratulatory phone call . MacArthur Fellow Jim Collins described this experience in an editorial column of The New York Times . Cecilia Conrad is the managing director leading the MacArthur Fellows Program .",
