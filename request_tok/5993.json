They are widely considered by critics , scholars , and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century . The brothers were included in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Stars list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classical Hollywood cinema , the only performers to be inducted collectively . The brothers are almost universally known today by their stage names : Chico , Harpo , Groucho , Gummo , and Zeppo . There was a sixth brother , the first born , named Manfred ( Mannie ) , who died aged seven months ; Zeppo was given the middle name Manfred in his memory . The core of the act was the three elder brothers : Chico , Harpo , and Groucho , each of whom developed a highly distinctive stage persona . After the group essentially disbanded in 1950 , Groucho went on to begin a successful second career in television , while Harpo and Chico appeared less prominently . The two younger brothers , Gummo and Zeppo , never developed their stage characters to the same extent as the elder three .

Gummo was not in any of the movies ; Zeppo appeared in the first five films in relatively straight ( non-comedic ) roles .
