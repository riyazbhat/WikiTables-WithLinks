  "/wiki/Elvis_Presley": "Elvis Aaron Presley [ a ] ( January 8 , 1935 - August 16 , 1977 ) , also known simply as Elvis , was an American singer and actor .

Presley was born in Tupelo , Mississippi , and relocated to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family when he was 13 years old . His music career began there in 1954 , recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience . Presley , on rhythm acoustic guitar , and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , was a pioneer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . In 1955 , drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley 's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who would manage him for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , Heartbreak Hotel , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial . In November 1956 , Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender . Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work . He held few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided .",
