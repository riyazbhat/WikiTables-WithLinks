  "/wiki/Illinois": "Illinois ( /\u02cc\u026al\u0259\u02c8n\u0254\u026a/ ( listen ) IL-\u0259-NOY ) is a state in the Midwestern and Great Lakes Regions of the United States . It has the fifth largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sixth largest population , and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states . Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",

He preserved the Union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the U.S. economy . Lincoln was born in poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana . He was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . Congressman from Illinois . In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . He reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new Republican Party and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas . Lincoln ran for President in 1860 , sweeping the North in victory . Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North 's rejection of their right to practice slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union . As the leader of moderate Republicans , Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold , and included Radical Republicans , War Democrats , Copperheads ( anti-war Democrats ) , and irreconcilable secessionists .",
