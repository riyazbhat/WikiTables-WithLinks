  "/wiki/Samson": "Samson ( ; , , man of the sun ) was the last of the judges of the ancient Israelites mentioned in the Book of Judges in the Hebrew Bible ( chapters 13 to 16 ) and one of the last of the leaders who judged Israel before the institution of the monarchy . He is sometimes considered to be an Israelite version of the popular Near Eastern folk hero also embodied by the Sumerian Enkidu and the Greek Heracles . The biblical account states that Samson was a Nazirite , and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats , including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of a donkey . However , if Samson 's long hair were cut , then his Nazirite vow would be violated and he would lose his strength . Samson was betrayed by his lover Delilah , who ordered a servant to cut his hair while he was sleeping and turned him over to his Philistine enemies , who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at Gaza . Whilst there his hair began to regrow . When the Philistines took Samson into their temple of Dagon , Samson asked to rest against one of the support pillars ; after being granted permission , he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength , allowing him to grasp hold of the columns and tear them down , killing himself and all the Philistines with him . In some Jewish traditions , Samson is believed to have been buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley . Samson has been the subject of both rabbinic and Christian commentary , with some Christians viewing him as a type of Jesus , based on similarities between their lives . Notable depictions of Samson include John Milton 's closet drama Samson Agonistes and Cecil B. DeMille 's 1949 Hollywood film Samson and Delilah . Samson also plays a major role in Western art and traditions .",
