  "/wiki/Comma-separated_values": "A comma-separated values ( CSV ) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values . Each line of the file is a data record . Each record consists of one or more fields , separated by commas . The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format . A CSV file typically stores tabular data ( numbers and text ) in plain text , in which case each line will have the same number of fields . The CSV file format is not fully standardized . The basic idea of separating fields with a comma is clear , but that idea gets complicated when the field data may also contain commas or even embedded line breaks . CSV implementations may not handle such field data , or they may use quotation marks to surround the field . Quotation does not solve everything : some fields may need embedded quotation marks , so a CSV implementation may include escape characters or escape sequences . In addition , the term CSV also denotes some closely related delimiter-separated formats that use different field delimiters , for example , semicolons . These include tab-separated values and space-separated values . A delimiter that is not present in the field data ( such as tab ) keeps the format parsing simple",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms",

The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release",

  "/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system": "Double-entry bookkeeping , in accounting , is a system of bookkeeping where every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account . The double-entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as debit and credit . The left-hand side is debit and right-hand side is credit . In a normally debited account , such as an asset account or an expense account , a debit increases the total quantity of money or financial value , and a credit decreases the amount or value . On the other hand , for an account that is normally credited , such as a liability account or a revenue account , it is credits that increase the account 's value and debits that decrease it . In double-entry bookkeeping , a transaction always affects at least two accounts , always includes at least one debit and one credit , and always has total debits and total credits that are equal . This is to keep the accounting equation ( below ) in balance . For example , if your business takes out a bank loan for $ 10,000 , recording the transaction would require a debit of $ 10,000 to an asset account called Cash , as well as a credit of $ 10,000 to a liability account called Notes Payable . Assets = Liabilities + Equity { \\displaystyle { \\text { Assets } } = { \\text { Liabilities } } + { \\text { Equity } } } The accounting equation is an error detection tool ; if at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts , an error has occurred . However , satisfying the equation does not guarantee that there are no errors ; the ledger may still balance even if the wrong ledger accounts have been debited or credited",

Since then it has gained wide acceptance in business practice and in theorizing relating to strategic management , corporate governance , business purpose and corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) . The definition of corporate responsibilities through a classification of stakeholders to consider has been criticized as creating a false dichotomy between the shareholder model and the stakeholders model or a false analogy of the obligations towards shareholders and other interested parties . Any action taken by any organization or any group might affect those people who are linked with them in the private sector .

  "/wiki/SQLite": "SQLite ( /\u02cc\u025bs\u02cckju\u02d0\u02cc\u025bl\u02c8a\u026at/ , /\u02c8si\u02d0kw\u0259\u02ccla\u026at/ ) is a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) contained in a C library . In contrast to many other database management systems , SQLite is not a client-server database engine . Rather , it is embedded into the end program . SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard , generally following PostgreSQL syntax . However , SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity . This means that one can , for example , insert a string into a column defined as an integer . SQLite will attempt to convert data between formats where appropriate , the string 123 into an integer in this case , but does not guarantee such conversions , and will store the data as-is if such a conversion is not possible . SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers . It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine , as it is used today by several widespread browsers , operating systems , and embedded systems ( such as mobile phones ) , among others . SQLite has bindings to many programming languages",
