  "/wiki/Programming_language": "A programming language is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers . There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions , rather than general programming languages . Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer , the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad , during the Islamic Golden Age . Since the early 1800s , programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms , music boxes and player pianos . The programs for these machines ( such as a player piano 's scrolls ) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions . Thousands of different programming languages have been created , and more are being created every year . Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ( i.e. , as a sequence of operations to perform ) while other languages use the declarative form ( i.e . the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it ) . The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form ) and semantics ( meaning ) . Some languages are defined by a specification document ( for example , the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard ) while other languages ( such as Perl ) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference .",

  "/wiki/Smalltalk": "Smalltalk is an object-oriented , dynamically typed reflective programming language . Smalltalk was created as the language underpinning the new world of computing exemplified by human-computer symbiosis . It was designed and created in part for educational use , specifically for constructionist learning , at the Learning Research Group ( LRG ) of Xerox PARC by Alan Kay , Dan Ingalls , Adele Goldberg , Ted Kaehler , Diana Merry , Scott Wallace , and others during the 1970s . The language was first generally released as Smalltalk-80 . Smalltalk-like languages are in active development and have gathered loyal communities of users around them . ANSI Smalltalk was ratified in 1998 and represents the standard version of Smalltalk . Smalltalk took second place for most loved programming language in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017 , but it was not among the 26 most loved programming languages of the 2018 survey .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",

Oracle Corporation usually extends PL/SQL functionality with each successive release of the Oracle Database . PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops . It allows declaration of constants and variables , procedures and functions , types and variables of those types , and triggers . It can handle exceptions ( run-time errors ) . Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections . Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database on wards have included features associated with object-orientation . One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures , functions , packages , types , and triggers , which are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces . Historically , the first public version of PL/SQL definition was in 1995 , and the Oracle 's inception year ~1992 . It implements the ISO SQL/PSM standard .",

There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",
  "/wiki/Apache_Flex": "Apache Flex , formerly Adobe Flex , is a software development kit ( SDK ) for the development and deployment of cross-platform rich Internet applications based on the Adobe Flash platform . Initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe Systems , Adobe donated Flex to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011 and it was promoted to a top-level project in December 2012 . The Flex 3 SDK was released under the open source Mozilla Public License in 2008 . Consequently , Flex applications can be developed using standard Integrated development environments ( IDEs ) , such as IntelliJ IDEA , Eclipse , the free and open source IDE FlashDevelop , as well as the proprietary Adobe Flash Builder . The latest version of the SDK is version 4.16.1 . It is released under version 2 of the Apache License . In 2014 , the Apache Software Foundation started a new project called FlexJS to cross-compile ActionScript 3 to JavaScript to enable it to run on browsers that do not support Adobe Flash Player and on devices that do not support the Adobe AIR runtime . In 2017 , FlexJS was renamed to Apache Royale . The Apache Software Foundation describes the current iteration of Apache Royale as an open-source frontend technology that allows a developer to code in ActionScript 3 and MXML and target web , mobile devices and desktop devices on Apache Cordova all at once . Apache Royale is currently in beta development stage .",
  "/wiki/ActionScript": "ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. ( later acquired by Adobe Systems ) . It is influenced by HyperTalk , the scripting language for HyperCard . It is now an implementation of ECMAScript ( meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript ) , though it originally arose as a sibling , both being influenced by HyperTalk . ActionScript is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform , used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files . ActionScript 3 is also used with Adobe AIR system for the development of desktop and mobile applications . The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open source compiler ( as part of Apache Flex ) and open source virtual machine ( Mozilla Tamarin ) are available . ActionScript is also used with Scaleform GFx for the development of 3D video game user interfaces and HUDs .",
  "/wiki/MXML": "MXML is an XML-based user interface markup language first introduced by Macromedia in March 2004 . Application developers use MXML in combination with ActionScript to develop rich Internet applications , with products such as Apache Flex . Adobe Systems , which acquired Macromedia in December 2005 , gives no official meaning for the acronym MXML . Some developers suggest it should stand for Magic eXtensible Markup Language ( which is a backronym ) . It is likely that the name comes from the MX suffix given to Macromedia Studio products released in 2002 and 2004 , or simply Macromedia eXtensible Markup Language . MXML is used mainly to declaratively lay out the interface of applications and can also be used to implement business logic and internet application behaviors . It can contain chunks of ActionScript code , either when creating the body of an event handler function , or with data binding where the curly braces ( { ) syntax is used . MXML is often used with Flex Server , which dynamically compiles it into standard binary SWF files . However , the Adobe Flash Builder IDE ( formerly Adobe Flex Builder ) and free Flex SDK can also compile MXML into SWF files without the use of a Flex Server . There is also a PHP PEAR package called XML_MXML , which is a framework to build Adobe Flex applications . MXML is considered a proprietary standard due to its tight integration with Adobe technologies . It is like XAML in this respect .",

  "/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)": "Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform . It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python , Ruby , and Smalltalk . It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform , is compiled to Java virtual machine ( JVM ) bytecode , and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and libraries . Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java 's . Groovy supports closures , multiline strings , and expressions embedded in strings . Much of Groovy 's power lies in its AST transformations , triggered through annotations . Groovy 1.0 was released on January 2 , 2007 , and Groovy 2.0 in July , 2012 . Since version 2 , Groovy can be compiled statically , offering type inference and performance near that of Java . Groovy 2.4 was the last major release under Pivotal Software 's sponsorship which ended in March 2015 . Groovy 2.5.8 is the latest stable version of Groovy . Groovy has since changed its governance structure to a Project Management Committee in the Apache Software Foundation .",

  "/wiki/BASIC": "BASIC ( Beginners ' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) is a family of general-purpose , high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use . The original version was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in 1964 . They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers . At the time , nearly all use of computers required writing custom software , which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn . In addition to the language itself , Kemeny and Kurtz developed the Dartmouth Time Sharing System ( DTSS ) , which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time . This general model became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Hewlett-Packard produced an entire computer line for this method of operation , introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s . Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC . The emergence of early microcomputers in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original Microsoft BASIC in 1975 . Due to the tiny main memory available on these machines , often 4 kB , a variety of Tiny BASIC dialects was also created . BASIC was available for almost any system of the era , and naturally became the de facto programming language for the home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s . These machines almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default , often in the machine 's firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge .",
  "/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)": "Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language , designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small , efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring . It is named in honour of the French mathematician , philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal . Based on Wirth 's book , Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs , Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language . Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of the ALGOL X efforts and proposed a version known as ALGOL W. This was not accepted , and the ALGOL X process bogged down . In 1968 , Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W , releasing this as Pascal in 1970 . On top of ALGOL 's scalars and arrays , Pascal enabled defining complex datatypes and building dynamic and recursive data structures such as lists , trees and graphs . Pascal has strong typing on all objects , which means that one type of data can not be converted or interpreted as another without explicit conversions . Unlike most languages in the C-family , Pascal allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth , and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines ( procedures and functions ) . A program is thus syntactically similar to a single procedure or function . Pascal became very successful in the 1970s , notably on the burgeoning minicomputer market . Compilers were also available for many microcomputers as the field emerged in the late 1970s . It was widely used as a teaching language in university-level programming courses in the 1980s , and also used in production settings for writing commercial software during the same period .",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",

  "/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",
