  "/wiki/Second_Congo_War": "The Second Congo War ( also known as the Great War of Africa or the Great African War , and sometimes referred to as the African World War ) began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 1998 , little more than a year after the First Congo War , and involved some of the same issues . The war officially ended in July 2003 , when the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo took power . Although a peace agreement was signed in 2002 , violence has continued in many regions of the country , especially in the east . Hostilities have continued since the ongoing Lord 's Resistance Army insurgency , and the Kivu and Ituri conflicts . Ultimately , nine African countries and around twenty-five armed groups became involved in the war . By 2008 , the war and its aftermath had caused 5.4 million deaths , principally through disease and starvation , making the Second Congo War the deadliest conflict worldwide since World War II . Another 2 million were displaced from their homes or sought asylum in neighboring countries . Despite a formal end to the war in July 2003 and an agreement by the former belligerents to create a government of national unity , 1,000 people died daily in 2004 from easily preventable cases of malnutrition and disease . The war was driven by ( as the conflicts afterwards have been ) the trade in conflict minerals , among other things .",

It grew out of resistance to the military junta led by Siad Barre during the 1980s . By 1988-1990 , the Somali Armed Forces began engaging various armed rebel groups , including the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in the northeast , the Somali National Movement in the northwest , and the United Somali Congress in the south . The clan-based armed opposition groups eventually managed to overthrow the Barre government in 1991 . Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum and turmoil that followed , particularly in the south . In 1990-92 customary law temporarily collapsed due to the fighting . This precipitated the arrival of UNOSOM I UN military observers in July 1992 , followed by larger peacekeeping forces . Factional fighting continued in the south . In the absence of a central government , Somalia became a failed state . The UN withdrew in 1995 , having incurred significant casualties , but no central authority had yet been reestablished . After the collapse of the central government , there was some return to customary and religious law in most regions . In 1991 and 1998 , two autonomous regional governments were also established in the northern part of the country .",

UNOSOM II carried on from the United States-controlled ( UN-sanctioned ) Unified Task Force ( UNITAF ) . It had been active for a transition period when United Nations Operation in Somalia I ( UNOSOM I ) mission proved to be ineffectual . All three of these interventions were intended to establish a secure enough environment for humanitarian operations to be carried out , because there was effectively no central government and the country was increasingly subject to factional violence and was suffering from famine , in part due to the warfare and social disruption . The UNOSOM II intervention was associated with the Battle of Mogadishu and related events in which eighteen American soldiers were killed . These events were the basis for the book Black Hawk Down : A Story of Modern War ( 1999 ) , and its adaptation as a film of the same name .",
  "/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War": "The Sierra Leone Civil War ( 1991-2002 ) was a civil war in Sierra Leone that began on 23 March 1991 when the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , with support from the special forces of Charles Taylors National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( NPFL ) , intervened in Sierra Leone in an attempt to overthrow the Joseph Momoh government . The resulting civil war lasted 11 years , enveloped the country , and left over 50,000 dead . During the first year of the war , the RUF took control of large swathes of territory in eastern and southern Sierra Leone , which were rich in alluvial diamonds . The government 's ineffective response to the RUF , and the disruption in government diamond production , precipitated a military coup d'\u00e9tat in April 1992 by the National Provisional Ruling Council ( NPRC ) . By the end of 1993 , the Sierra Leone Army ( SLA ) had succeeded in pushing the RUF rebels back to the Liberian border , but the RUF recovered and fighting continued . In March 1995 , Executive Outcomes ( EO ) , a South Africa-based private military company , was hired to repel the RUF . Sierra Leone installed an elected civilian government in March 1996 , and the retreating RUF signed the Abidjan Peace Accord . Under UN pressure , the government terminated its contract with EO before the accord could be implemented , and hostilities recommenced . In May 1997 a group of disgruntled SLA officers staged a coup and established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council ( AFRC ) as the new government of Sierra Leone . The RUF joined with the AFRC to capture Freetown with little resistance . The new government , led by Johnny Paul Koroma , declared the war over . A wave of looting , rape , and murder followed the announcement .",

The war , which lasted from 1990 to 1994 , arose from the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population . A 1959-1962 revolution had replaced the Tutsi monarchy with a Hutu-led republic , forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries . A group of these refugees in Uganda founded the RPF which , under the leadership of Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame , became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s . The war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda , advancing 60 km ( 37 mi ) into the country . They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day . The Rwandan Army , assisted by troops from France , gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October . Kagame , who had been in the United States during the invasion , returned to take command . He withdrew troops to the Virunga Mountains for several months before attacking again . The RPF began a guerrilla war , which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand . A series of protests forced Rwandan President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties . Despite disruption and killings by Hutu Power , a group of extremists opposed to any deal , and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993 , the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the Arusha Accords in August 1993 .",

  "/wiki/Kosovo_War": "The Kosovo War was an armed conflict in Kosovo that started in late February 1998 and lasted until 11 June 1999 . It was fought by the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( i.e . Serbia and Montenegro ) , which controlled Kosovo before the war , and the Kosovo Albanian rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) , with air support from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) from 24 March 1999 , and ground support from the Albanian army . The KLA , formed in the early 1990s to fight against Serbian persecution of Kosovo Albanians , initiated its first campaign in 1995 when it launched attacks against Serbian law enforcement in Kosovo . In June 1996 the group claimed responsibility for acts of sabotage targeting Kosovo police stations . In 1997 , the organisation acquired a large amount of arms through weapons smuggling from Albania , following a rebellion in which weapons were looted from the country 's police and army posts . In early 1998 , KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents ; this campaign killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants . After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed , NATO intervened , justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a humanitarian war . This precipitated a mass expulsion of Kosovar Albanians as the Yugoslav forces continued to fight during the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia ( March-June 1999 ) . By 2000 , investigations had recovered the remains of almost three thousand victims of all ethnicities , and in 2001 a United Nations administered Supreme Court , based in Kosovo , found that there had been a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments , but that Yugoslav troops had tried to remove rather than eradicate the Albanian population . The war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty , with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence . The Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after this , with some of its members going on to fight for the U\u00c7PMB in the Pre\u0161evo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army ( NLA ) and Albanian National Army ( ANA ) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia , while others went on to form the Kosovo Police .",

Following the 2006 Lebanon War , the United Nations Security Council enhanced UNIFIL and decided that in addition to the original mandate , it would , among other things , monitor the cessation of hostilities ; accompany and support the Lebanese Armed Forces as they deploy throughout the south of Lebanon ; and extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons . The first UNIFIL troops deployed in the area on 23 March 1978 were reassigned from other UN peacekeeping operations in the area ( United Nations Emergency Force , the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization , and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone ) . During the occupation , UNIFIL 's function was mainly to provide humanitarian aid . UNIFIL 's mandate is renewed by the United Nations Security Council annually . The latest mandate expired on 31 August 2019 . Its funding is approved on an annual basis by the General Assembly . It has a budget of $ 474 million for the period from July 2018 to June 2019 ."
