  "/wiki/Ascott,_Buckinghamshire": "Ascott is a hamlet and country house in the parish of Wing , Buckinghamshire , England . The hamlet lies completely within the boundary of the Ascott Estate ; it is home to many of the estate and house staff . Prior to the Norman Conquest there was an abbey at Ascott , that had been given by a royal to a Benedictine convent in Angiers . In 1415 however , the same year as the Battle of Agincourt , the convent was seized by the English church because it belonged to the French and awarded to the Convent of St Mary du Pre , near St Albans . In the early 16th century the abbey ( along with the manor of Wing ) was seized by the Crown and given to Cardinal Wolsey , however not long after it was seized once again in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and given to Lord Dormer . It was in 1554 that Dormer entertained Princess Elizabeth at the house , when she was on the road to London under arrest as a Protestant because her sister Mary had just taken the throne . The former abbey , now a house , itself once featured additions that were attributed to Inigo Jones . The house fell into decay following the death without heir of its owner the Earl of Caernarvon in 1709 . In 1727 the house and estate were broken up , the deer sold and all the timber cut down and sold off . In the late 19th century members of the Rothschild banking family began to acquire estates in the area , including Ascott . In 1873 a farm house in the parish known as Ascott Hall was bought by Baron Mayer de Rothschild he gave it to his nephew Leopold de Rothschild who employed the architect George Devey to enlarge the property into a substantial country house . Today this is the National Trust property known as Ascott House or sometimes known more simply as just Ascott .",

The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure . The National Trust has been the beneficiary of many large donations and bequests . It owns over 500 heritage properties , which include many historic houses and gardens , industrial monuments , and social history sites . Most of these are open to the public , usually for a charge . Others are leased to tenants on terms that manage to preserve their character whilst providing for more limited public access .

  "/wiki/Bletchley_Park": "Bletchley Park is a 19th-century mansion and estate in Milton Keynes ( Buckinghamshire ) that became the principal centre of Allied code-breaking during the Second World War . The mansion was constructed during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir Herbert Leon in the Victorian Gothic , Tudor , and Dutch Baroque styles , on the site of older buildings of the same name . During World War II , the estate housed the British Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) , which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers - most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers ; among its most notable early personnel the GC & CS team of codebreakers included Alan Turing , Gordon Welchman , Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry . The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war . According to the official historian of British Intelligence , the Ultra intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years , and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain . The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption , culminating in the development of Colossus , the world 's first programmable digital electronic computer . [ a ] Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s . After the war , the Post Office took over the site and used it as a management school , but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment , so the Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers . More recently , Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations , and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually . The separate National Museum of Computing , which includes a working replica Bombe machine and a rebuilt Colossus computer , is housed in Block H on the site .",

Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) . Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist , for most of his career he was a member of the Conservative Party , which he led from 1940 to 1955 , but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the Liberal Party . Of mixed English and American parentage , Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy , aristocratic family . He joined the British Army in 1895 , and saw action in British India , the Anglo-Sudan War , and the Second Boer War , gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns . Elected an MP in 1900 , initially as a Conservative , he defected to the Liberals in 1904 . In H. H. Asquith 's Liberal government , Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty , championing prison reform and workers ' social security .

In 1917 , he returned to government under David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , then as Secretary of State for War and Air , and finally for the Colonies , overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and Britain 's Middle East policy . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin 's Conservative government , returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy .

One of the most popular poets of his time , Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside . In many ways , he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry . Samuel Taylor Coleridge called him the best modern poet , whilst William Wordsworth particularly admired his poem Yardley-Oak . After being institutionalised for insanity , Cowper found refuge in a fervent evangelical Christianity . He continued to suffer doubt and , after a dream in 1773 , believed that he was doomed to eternal damnation . He recovered and wrote more religious hymns . His religious sentiment and association with John Newton ( who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace ) led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered , and to the series of Olney Hymns . His poem Light Shining out of Darkness gave English the phrase : God moves in a mysterious way/ His wonders to perform . He also wrote a number of anti-slavery poems and his friendship with Newton , who was an avid anti-slavery campaigner , resulted in Cowper being asked to write in support of the Abolitionist campaign . Cowper wrote a poem called The Negro 's Complaint ( 1788 ) which rapidly became very famous , and was often quoted by Martin Luther King Jr. during the 20th century civil rights movement . He also wrote several other less well known poems on slavery in the 1780s , many of which attacked the idea that slavery was economically viable .",

  "/wiki/John_Milton": "John Milton ( 9 December 1608 - 8 November 1674 ) was an English poet and intellectual , who served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell . He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval , and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , written in blank verse , widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written . Writing in English , Latin , Greek , and Italian , he achieved international renown within his lifetime , and his celebrated Areopagitica ( 1644 ) , written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship , is among history 's most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . His desire for freedom extended into his style : he introduced new words ( coined from Latin ) to the English language , and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations . William Hayley 's 1796 biography called him the greatest English author , and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language , though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death ( often on account of his republicanism ) . Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as a poem which ... with respect to design may claim the first place , and with respect to performance , the second , among the productions of the human mind , though he ( a Tory and recipient of royal patronage ) described Milton 's politics as those of an acrimonious and surly republican . Poets such as William Blake , William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy revered him .",

  "/wiki/Milton_Keynes": "Milton Keynes ( /ki\u02d0nz/ ( listen ) KEENZ , locally abbreviated to MK ) is a large town [ b ] in ( ceremonial ) Buckinghamshire , England , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north-west of London . It is the principal settlement of the Borough of Milton Keynes , a unitary authority . At the 2011 Census , its population was almost 230,000 ; the Office for National Statistics estimates that it will reach 300,000 by 2025 . The River Great Ouse forms its northern boundary ; a tributary , the River Ouzel , meanders through its linear parks and balancing lakes . Approximately 25 % of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two SSIs . In the 1960s , the UK Government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London . The New Town ( in planning documents , New City ) of Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet , with a target population of 250,000 , in a designated area of about 22,000 acres ( 9,000 ha ) . At designation , its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley , Wolverton , and Stony Stratford , along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between . These settlements had an extensive historical record since the Norman conquest ; detailed archaeological investigations prior to development revealed evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic age to modern times , including in particular the Milton Keynes Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery . The government established a Development Corporation ( MKDC ) to design and deliver this New City . The Corporation decided on a softer , more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier new towns but with an emphatically modernist architecture . Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic , they established a 'relaxed ' grid of distributor roads about 1 kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) between edges , leaving the spaces between to develop more organically .",
  "/wiki/Wolverton_railway_works": "Wolverton railway works , known locally as Wolverton Works or just The Works , was established in Wolverton , Buckinghamshire , by the London and Birmingham Railway Company in 1838 at the midpoint of the 112 miles ( 180 km ) -long route from London to Birmingham . The line was developed by Robert Stephenson following the great success of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway line . The Victorian era new towns of Wolverton and New Bradwell were built to house the workers and service the works . The older towns of Stony Stratford and Newport Pagnell grew substantially too , being joined to it by the Wolverton and Stony Stratford Tramway and the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line ( a branch line ) , respectively . The trams were also hauled by steam locomotives : the tram cars were certainly the largest ever in the UK and possibly the world . In modern times Wolverton railway works remains notable as the home of the British Royal Train but otherwise is very much reduced from its heyday . As of 2013 [ update ] , the facility is much reduced : a full-scale train maintenance , repairs and refurbishment works is operated at the western end of the site , the central area is derelict but slated for redevelopment , the eastern end is a Tesco store with canal-side housing development at the extreme eastern end ."
