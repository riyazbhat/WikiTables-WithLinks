  "/wiki/Art_deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art .

  "/wiki/American_Foursquare": "The American Foursquare or American Four Square is an American house style popular from the mid-1890s to the late 1930s . A reaction to the ornate and mass-produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century , the American Foursquare was plain , often incorporating handcrafted honest woodwork ( unless purchased from a mail-order catalog ) . This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles . It is also sometimes called Transitional Period . The hallmarks of the style include a basically square , boxy design , two-and-one-half stories high , usually with four large , boxy rooms to a floor , a center dormer , and a large front porch with wide stairs . The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space , to use a small city lot to best advantage . Other common features included a hipped roof , arched entries between common rooms , built-in cabinetry , and Craftsman-style woodwork . A typical design would be as follows : first floor , from front to back , on one side , the living room and dining room ; while on the other side , the entry room or foyer , stairway and kitchen . Sometimes a bathroom was also included . Second floor , front to back , on one side , bedroom , bathroom and bedroom ; while on the other side , bedroom , stairway and bedroom . The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side-by-side closets between the bedrooms . This gave a very efficient layout , with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway",
  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece",
  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University",

He operated with a group of men known as the Dillinger Gang or The Terror Gang which was accused of robbing 24 banks and four police stations , among other crimes . Dillinger escaped from jail twice . He was also charged with the murder of an East Chicago , Indiana police officer who shot Dillinger in his bullet-resistant vest during a shootout , prompting him to return fire ; he was not convicted of this crime . However , it was Dillinger 's only homicide charge , despite his infamy . He courted publicity and the media ran exaggerated accounts of his bravado and colorful personality , styling him as a Robin Hood figure . In response , J. Edgar Hoover , then Director of the Bureau of Investigation ( BOI ) , used Dillinger and his gang as his campaign platform to evolve the BOI into the FBI , developing more sophisticated investigative techniques as weapons against organized crime . After evading police in four states for almost a year , Dillinger was wounded and returned to his father 's home to recover . He returned to Chicago in July 1934 and sought refuge in a brothel owned by Ana Cump\u0103na\u0219 , who informed police and federal agents of his whereabouts .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical",

Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production .

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August .

As of the 2010 census , the city had a population of 66,135 . The name Schenectady is derived from a Mohawk word , skahn\u00e9htati , meaning beyond the pines . Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century , many from the Albany area . They were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly , which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664 . Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river . Connected to the west via the Mohawk River and Erie Canal , Schenectady developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade , manufacturing and transportation corridor . By 1824 more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade , and the city had a cotton mill , processing cotton from the Deep South . Numerous mills in New York had such ties with the South . Through the 19th century , nationally influential companies and industries developed in Schenectady , including General Electric and American Locomotive Company ( ALCO ) , which were powers into the mid-20th century . Schenectady was part of emerging technologies , with GE collaborating in the production of nuclear-powered submarines and , in the 21st century , working on other forms of renewable energy . Schenectady is in eastern New York , near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers",
  "/wiki/2-8-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 2-8-0 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle , usually in a leading truck , eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles , and no trailing wheels . In the United States and elsewhere , this wheel arrangement is commonly known as a Consolidation , after the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroads Consolidation , the name of the first 2-8-0 . The Consolidation represented a notable advance in locomotive power . After 1875 , it became the most popular type of freight locomotive in the United States and was built in greater quantities than any other single wheel arrangement",
  "/wiki/Steam_locomotive": "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine . These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal , wood , or oil - to produce steam in a boiler . The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive 's main wheels ( drivers ) . Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive , either on the locomotive itself or in wagons ( tenders ) pulled behind . Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century . Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive in 1802 . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. , the Salamanca ( locomotive ) , the Locomotion No . 1 , built by George Stephenson and his son Robert 's company Robert Stephenson and Company , was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway , the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 . In 1830 , George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in the United Kingdom , the United States , and much of Europe in the first decades of steam . In the 20th century , Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Nigel Gresley designed some of the most famous locomotives , including the Flying Scotsman , the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and a LNER Class A4 , 4468 Mallard , which still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . From the early 1900s , steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives , with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s",
  "/wiki/Tender_(rail)": "A tender or coal-car is a special rail vehicle hauled by a steam locomotive containing its fuel ( wood , coal , or oil ) and water . Steam locomotives consume large quantities of water compared to the quantity of fuel , so their tenders are necessary to keep them running over long distances . A locomotive that pulls a tender is called a tender locomotive . Locomotives that do not have tenders and carry all their fuel and water on board the locomotive ( itself ) instead are called tank locomotives . A brake tender is a tender that is heavy and used ( primarily ) to provide greater braking efficiency",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis",

The first house in England that was classified as a bungalow was built in 1869 . In America it was initially used as a vacation architecture , and was most popular between 1900-1918 , especially with the Arts and Crafts movement",
  "/wiki/Neogothic": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958",
  "/wiki/Presbyterian": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40 % of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details",
  "/wiki/Widow's_walk": "A widow 's walk , also known as a widow 's watch or roofwalk , is a railed rooftop platform often with a small enclosed cupola frequently found on 19th-century North American coastal houses . The name is said to come from the wives of mariners , who would watch for their spouses ' return , often in vain as the ocean took the lives of the mariners , leaving the women widows . In other coastal communities , the platforms were called Captain 's Walk , as they topped the homes of the more successful captains ; supposedly , ship owners and captains would use them to search the horizon for ships due in port . However , there is little or no evidence that widow 's walks were intended or regularly used to observe shipping . Widow 's walks are in fact a standard decorative feature of Italianate architecture , which was very popular during the height of the Age of Sail in many North American coastal communities . The widow 's walk is a variation of the Italianate cupola . The Italianate cupola , also known as a belvedere , was an important ornate finish to this style , although it was often high maintenance and prone to leaks . Beyond their use as viewing platforms , they are frequently built around the chimney of the residence , thus creating access to the structure . This allows the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hope of preventing the house from burning down",

  "/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense": "The secretary of defense ( SecDef ) is the leader and chief executive officer of the United States Department of Defense , the executive department of the Armed Forces of the U.S . The secretary of defense 's position of command and authority over the U.S. military is second only to that of the president . This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council . The secretary of defense is a statutory office , and the general provision in 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 113 provides that subject to the direction of the President , its occupant has authority , direction and control over the Department of Defense . The same statute further designates the secretary as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense . To ensure civilian control of the military , no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular ( i.e. , non-reserve ) component of an armed force . Subject only to the orders of the president , the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control , for both operational and administrative purposes , over all Department of Defense forces - the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force - as well as the U.S. Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense . Only the secretary of defense ( or the president or Congress ) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments ( the departments of the Army , Navy , and Air Force ) and the 10 Combatant Commands ( Africa Command , Central Command , European Command , Indo-Pacific Command , Northern Command , Southern Command , Cyber Command , Special Operations Command , Strategic Command , Transportation Command ) . Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer , and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy , its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto deputy commander-in-chief . ( The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president , and while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions , the chairman is not in the chain of command . )",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland",

  "/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration": "The Federal Emergency Relief Administration ( FERA ) was the new name given by the Roosevelt Administration to the Emergency Relief Administration ( ERA ) which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had created in 1933 . FERA was established as a result of the Federal Emergency Relief Act and was replaced in 1935 by the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) . Prior to 1933 , the federal government gave loans to the states to operate relief programs . One of these , the New York state program TERA ( Temporary Emergency Relief Administration ) , was set up in 1931 and headed by Harry Hopkins , a close adviser to Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt . Roosevelt asked Congress to set up FERA - which gave grants to the states for the same purpose - in May 1933 , and appointed Hopkins to head it . Along with the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) it was the first relief operation under the New Deal . FERA 's main goal was to alleviate household unemployment by creating new unskilled jobs in local and state government . Jobs were more expensive than direct cash payments ( called the dole ) , but were psychologically more beneficial to the unemployed , who wanted any sort of job , for self-esteem , to play the role of male breadwinner . From May 1933 until it closed in December 1935 , FERA gave states and localities $ 3.1 billion ( the equivalent of $ 55.4 billion in 2017 ) . FERA provided work for over 20 million people and developed facilities on public lands across the country . Faced with continued high unemployment and concerns for public welfare during the coming winter of 1933-34 , FERA instituted the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) as a $ 400 million short-term measure to get people to work .

In other English-speaking parts of the world , Queen Anne style refers to entirely different styles . In British architecture the term is mostly used of domestic buildings up to the size of a manor house , and usually designed elegantly but simply by local builders or architects , rather than the grand palaces of noble magnates . Contrary to the American usage of the term , it is characterised by strongly bilateral symmetry with an Italianate or Palladian-derived pediment on the front formal elevation .
