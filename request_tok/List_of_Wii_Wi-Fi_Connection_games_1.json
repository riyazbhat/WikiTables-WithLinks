  "/wiki/Pinball": "Pinball is a type of arcade game , in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more metallic balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine . The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible . Many modern pinball machines include a storyline where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story , usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game . Different numbers of points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field . A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field , partially protected by player-controlled paddles called flippers . A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times . Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing ( by earning extra balls and keeping the ball in play as long as possible ) , and to earn bonus credits by achieving a high enough score or through other means .",

Mega Man 9 is the first home console game in the original Mega Man series since Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass , which were released at least one decade earlier . Mega Man 9 was the first game in the series not to have a physical release , and was initially released only on the downloadable gaming services WiiWare , PlayStation Network ( PSN ) , and Xbox Live Arcade ( XBLA ) . In June 2017 , it was announced that Mega Man 9 and 10 would have a physical release with their inclusion in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One and Microsoft Windows , along with a digital version released for Nintendo Switch in May 2018 . Taking place during the early 21st century , Mega Man 9 continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man . When destructive attacks by powerful robots begin occurring all over the world , Mega Man 's creator , the good-hearted Dr. Light , is blamed . Mega Man 's arch enemy , the evil Dr. Wily , claims to be uninvolved in the incidents . It is up to Mega Man to stop the robots , prove his creator 's innocence , and reveal Wily 's true intentions . Mega Man 9 uses the classic 2D side-scrolling gameplay on which the series is based . Using both action and platforming elements , the player must complete a series of eight , initial stages in any order desired . Defeating each stage 's Robot Master boss copies its unique weapon , which the player can select at will throughout the remainder of the game .",
  "/wiki/Action_video_game": "An action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges , including hand-eye coordination and reaction-time . The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres , such as fighting games , beat 'em ups , shooter games and platform games . Multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered action games . In an action game , the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar . This player character must navigate a level , collecting objects , avoiding obstacles , and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal . At the end of a level or group of levels , the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game 's story . Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character 's health and lives , and the player receives a game over when they run out of lives . Alternatively , the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final goal , and see the credits . But some action games , such as early arcade games , are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels ; with the player 's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score .",
  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",
