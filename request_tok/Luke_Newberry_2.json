  "/wiki/Theatre_Royal_Bath": "The Theatre Royal in Bath , England , was built in 1805 . A Grade II* listed building , it has been described by the Theatres Trust as One of the most important surviving examples of Georgian theatre architecture . It has a capacity for an audience of around 900 . The Theatre Royal was built to replace the Old Orchard Street Theatre , funded by a Tontine and elaborately decorated . The architect was George Dance the Younger , with John Palmer carrying out much of the work . It opened with a performance of Shakespeare 's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan , William Macready and Edmund Kean . A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps , which included the construction of the current entrance . Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892 ; more extensive building work , including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting , followed in 1902 . Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt , the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell , the theatre was rarely very profitable . During World War II Donald Wolfit , Irene Vanbrugh , John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared , with shows including No\u00ebl Coward 's Private Lives and Blyth Spirit , a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as Charley 's Aunt , but audiences declined . In 1979 the theatre was bought by a trust and , following public donations , it underwent refurbishment , with the rebuilding of the stage and the installation of a new taller fly tower for scenery and lighting .

  "/wiki/Macbeth": "Macbeth ( /m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8/ ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare ; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606 . [ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play .",
  "/wiki/The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor": "The Merry Wives of Windsor is a comedy by William Shakespeare first published in 1602 , though believed to have been written in or before 1597 . The Windsor of the play 's title is a reference to the town of Windsor , also the location of Windsor Castle , in Berkshire , England . Though nominally set in the reign of Henry IV , the play makes no pretence to exist outside contemporary Elizabethan era English middle class life . It features the character Sir John Falstaff , the fat knight who had previously been featured in Henry IV , Part 1 and Part 2 . It has been adapted for the opera on several occasions . The play is one of Shakespeare 's lesser-regarded works among literary critics ."
