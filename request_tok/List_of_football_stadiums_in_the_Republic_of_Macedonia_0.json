Originally a Paeonian city , Scupi became the capital of Dardania in the second century BC . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 .
