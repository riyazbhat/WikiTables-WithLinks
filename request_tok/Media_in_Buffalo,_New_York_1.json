  "/wiki/Rimshot_(broadcasting)": "In radio and television broadcasting a rimshot is a station that attempts to reach a larger media market from a distant suburban , exurban , or even rural location . The term is primarily used with FM stations , and mainly in North America . The name derives not from the sound of a rimshot in music , but rather from basketball , where the ball hits the rim of the basket , and may or may not go in . Rimshot stations are often at a disadvantage compared to higher-strength signals in a market . Many rimshot operators attempt to serve the larger market with a signal that has deficiencies in the intended listening area , especially on the far side from where it is transmitted . Many ( if not most ) rimshot stations are move-ins , having moved to about halfway between their city of license ( which they are legally required to cover and serve ) and the metro area which they actually care about . In this manner , the broadcast range of the station ideally covers both . Although stations have traditionally been required to keep their main studio in their community of license , this has become less and less meaningful as more and more have been granted waivers to consolidate radio studios at a single location due to concentration of media ownership . In the U.S. , it was FCC MM docket 80-90 that allowed FM stations to have closer spacing , thereby allowing move-ins , and some new stations as well . This has generally been allowed , especially when it makes room for additional stations in outlying areas . In these cases , the table of allotments is amended in a rulemaking proceeding , although this is not always a requirement to move a station in most cases , depending on each particular situation . On an international level , stations which attempt to serve another country are called border blasters",
