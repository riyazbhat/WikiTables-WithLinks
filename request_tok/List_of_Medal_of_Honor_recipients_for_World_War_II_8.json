  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived",
  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States",

  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin .

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces": "The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army , and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States , during and immediately after World War II ( 1939/41-1945 ) , successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force of today , one of the five uniformed military services . The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which on 2 March 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the Army Air Forces . Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff . The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and the ground forces ' corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel . The peak size of the AAF during the Second World War was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 . By V-E Day , the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide . The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force , and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 . The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps , which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 , and the GHQ Air Force , which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom . Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947 . In its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization . By the end of World War II , the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service . By regulation and executive order , it was a subordinate agency of the United States Department of War ( as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces ) tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , and limited in responsibility to the continental United States",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script",

  "/wiki/Ensign_(rank)": "Ensign ( /\u02c8\u025bns\u0259n/ ; Late Middle English , from Old French enseigne ( 12c . ) mark , symbol , signal ; flag , standard , pennant , from Latin insignia ( plural ) ) is a junior rank of a commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries , normally in the infantry or navy . As the junior officer in an infantry regiment was traditionally the carrier of the ensign flag , the rank acquired the name . This rank has generally been replaced in army ranks by second lieutenant . Ensigns were generally the lowest ranking commissioned officer , except where the rank of subaltern existed . In contrast , the Arab rank of ensign , \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621 , liwa ' , derives from the command of units with an ensign , not the carrier of such a unit 's ensign , and is today the equivalent of a major general . In Thomas Venn 's 1672 Military and Maritime Discipline in Three Books , the duties of ensigns are to include not only carrying the colour but assisting the captain and lieutenant of a company and in their absence , have their authority . Ensign is enseigne in French , and chor\u0105\u017cy in Polish , each of which derives from a term for a flag . The Spanish alf\u00e9rez and Portuguese alferes is a junior officer rank below lieutenant associated with carrying the flag , and so is often translated as ensign . Unlike the rank in other languages , its etymology has nothing to do with flags , but instead comes from the Arabic for cavalier or knight . F\u00e4hnrich in German comes from an older German military title , Fahnentr\u00e4ger ( flag bearer ) ; however , it is an officer cadet rank , not a junior officer - the same applies to the Dutch vaandrig , which has a parallel etymology . In the German Landsknecht armies ( c. 1480 ) , the equivalent rank of cornet existed for those men who carried the troop standard ( known as a cornet )",
  "/wiki/USS_California_(BB-44)": "USS California ( BB-44 ) was the second of two Tennessee-class battleships built for the United States Navy between her keel laying in October 1916 and her commissioning in August 1921 . The Tennessee class was part of the standard series of twelve battleships built in the 1910s and 1920s , and were developments of the preceding New Mexico class . They were armed with a battery of twelve 14-inch ( 360 mm ) guns in four three-gun turrets . California served as the flagship of the Battle Fleet in the Pacific Ocean for duration of her peacetime career . She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises , including the annual Fleet Problems , and cruises around the Americas and further abroad , such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925 . California was moored in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked the port , bringing the United States into World War II . The ship was moderately damaged by a pair of torpedoes and a bomb , but a fire disabled the ship 's electrical system , preventing the pumps from being used to keep the ship afloat . California slowly filled with water over the following three days and eventually sank . Her crew suffered heavy casualties in the attack and four men were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the attack . She was raised in April 1942 , repaired and heavily rebuilt , and returned to service in January 1944 . The ship thereafter supported the amphibious operations conducted during the Pacific War , including the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign ( though she was damaged in a collision with Tennessee and thus missed the Battle of Peleliu ) and the Philippines campaign , during which she took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait . She was hit by a kamikaze during the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 , after repairs , joined the fleet supporting troops fighting on Okinawa during the Battle of Okinawa",
