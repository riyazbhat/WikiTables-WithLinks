  "/wiki/Tanning_(leather)": "Tanning is the process of treating skins and hides of animals to produce leather . A tannery is the place where the skins are processed . Tanning hide into leather involves a process which permanently alters the protein structure of skin , making it more durable and less susceptible to decomposition , and also possibly coloring it . Before tanning , the skins are unhaired , degreased , desalted and soaked in water over a period of 6 hours to 2 days . Historically this process was considered a noxious or odoriferous trade and relegated to the outskirts of town . Traditionally , tanning used tannin , an acidic chemical compound from which the tanning process draws its name . The use of a chromium ( III ) solution was adopted by tanners in the Industrial Revolution .",

  "/wiki/Winton_Train": "The Winton Train was a private passenger train that travelled from the Czech Republic to Great Britain in September 2009 in tribute to the wartime efforts of Sir Nicholas Winton , described as the 'British Schindler ' for his part in saving refugee children from Czechoslovakia . As a result of Sir Nicholas ' efforts in the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , a total of seven locomotives transported 669 Czechoslovak children of mainly Jewish heritage from Prague to safety in Great Britain . Sir Nicholas ' kindertransport efforts remained largely unrecognised until 1988 , when they came to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details . Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust . As the majority of 'Winton 's Children ' ( as they came to be known ) were Jewish , it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia . As of 2009 , the direct descendants of Winton 's Children numbered over 5000 people . The 2009 tribute Winton Train carried some of the individuals Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939 , along with their families , as it retraced the original kindertransport route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier . The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009 , the 70th anniversary of the eighth , and intended last , train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day . It departed from Prague Main railway station and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands . After a transfer by ferry to Harwich , the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London 's Liverpool Street station on 4 September , where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself . For the journey across mainland Europe , the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic steam locomotives , while the British leg was hauled by 60163 Tornado , a brand-new , main-line British steam locomotive completed in 2008 , along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s . The tribute train was the centrepiece of a wider cultural awareness project known as 'Inspiration by Goodness ' , organised by the Czech government .",
  "/wiki/Theresienstadt_concentration_camp": "Theresienstadt ( Czech : Terez\u00edn [ \u02c8t\u025br\u025bzi\u02d0n ] ) was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town Terez\u00edn , located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ( a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia ) . Theresienstadt served two main purposes : it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps , and a retirement settlement for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution . Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners , and the ghetto also served a propaganda role . Unlike other ghettos , the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant . The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941 . The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942 ; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war . About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt , mostly from malnutrition and disease . More than 88,000 people were held there for months or years before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites ; the Jewish self-administration 's role in choosing those to be deported has attracted significant controversy . Including 4,000 of the deportees who survived , the total number of survivors was around 23,000 . Theresienstadt was known for its relatively rich cultural life , including concerts , lectures , and clandestine education for children . The fact that it was governed by a Jewish self-administration as well as the large number of prominent Jews imprisoned there facilitated the flourishing of cultural life . This spiritual legacy has attracted the attention of scholars and sparked interest in the ghetto .",

Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 .

During the First World War ( 1914-18 ) , an Arab uprising and the British Empire 's Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby drove the Turks out of the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . The United Kingdom had agreed in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence that it would honour Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans , but the two sides had different interpretations of this agreement , and in the end , the UK and France divided up the area under the Sykes-Picot Agreement - an act of betrayal in the eyes of the Arabs . Further complicating the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , promising British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine . At the war 's end the British and French set up a joint Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in what had been Ottoman Syria . The British achieved legitimacy for their continued control by obtaining a mandate from the League of Nations in June 1922 . The formal objective of the League of Nations mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire , which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century , until such time as they are able to stand alone . During the British Mandate period the area experienced the ascent of two major nationalist movements , one among the Jews and the other among the Palestinian Arabs . The competing national interests of the two populations against each other and against the governing British authorities matured into the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939 and the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine , before culminating in the 1947-1949 Palestine war . This led to the establishment of the 1949 cease-fire agreement , with partition of the former Mandatory Palestine between the newborn state of Israel with a Jewish majority , the Arab West Bank annexed by the Jordanian Kingdom and the Arab All-Palestine Protectorate in the Gaza Strip under Egypt .",

It was the second-largest ghetto in all of German-occupied Europe after the Warsaw Ghetto . Situated in the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , and originally intended as a preliminary step upon a more extensive plan of creating the Judenfrei province of Warthegau , the ghetto was transformed into a major industrial centre , manufacturing war supplies for Nazi Germany and especially for the Wehrmacht . The number of people incarcerated in it was increased further by the Jews deported from the Third Reich territories . On 30 April 1940 , when the gates closed on the ghetto , it housed 163,777 residents . Because of its remarkable productivity , the ghetto managed to survive until August 1944 .

During this time , it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were killed in its gas chambers , along with 2,000 Romani people . More Jews were killed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz . Managed by the German SS and the Trawniki guards - enlisted voluntarily from among Soviet POWs to serve with the Germans - the camp consisted of two separate units . Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp ( Arbeitslager ) whose prisoners worked in the gravel pit or irrigation area and in the forest , where they cut wood to fuel the cremation pits . Between 1941 and 1944 , more than half of its 20,000 inmates died from summary executions , hunger , disease and mistreatment . The second camp , Treblinka II , was an extermination camp ( Vernichtungslager ) , referred to euphemistically as the SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka by the Nazis . A small number of Jewish men who were not killed immediately upon arrival became its Jewish slave-labour units called Sonderkommandos , forced to bury the victims ' bodies in mass graves .

  "/wiki/Flossenb\u00fcrg_concentration_camp": "Flossenb\u00fcrg was a Nazi concentration camp built in May 1938 by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office . Unlike other concentration camps it was located in a remote area , in the Fichtel Mountains of Bavaria , adjacent to the town of Flossenb\u00fcrg and near the German border with Czechoslovakia . The camp 's initial purpose was to exploit the forced labor of prisoners for the production of granite for Nazi architecture .

It also developed an extensive subcamp system that eventually outgrew the main camp . Before it was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945 , 89,964 to 100,000 prisoners passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps . Around 30,000 people died there , from malnutrition , overwork , or executions , or during the death marches .
