His byname , cuar\u00e1n , is usually translated as sandal . His name appears in a variety of anglicized forms , including Olaf Cuaran and Olaf Sihtricson , particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in York . He was the last of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair to play a major part in the politics of the British Isles . Amla\u00edb was twice , perhaps three times , ruler of Northumbria and twice ruler of Dublin and its dependencies . His reign over these territories spanned some forty years . He was a renowned warrior and a ruthless pillager of churches , but ended his days in retirement at Iona Abbey . Born when the U\u00ed \u00cdmair ruled over large areas of the British Isles , by his death the kingdom of Dublin was a minor power in Irish politics . At the same time , Dublin became a major centre of trade in Atlantic Europe and mastery over the city and its wealth became the supreme prize for ambitious Irish kings . In death Amla\u00edb was the prototype for the Middle English romance character Havelok the Dane . In life he was a patron of Irish poets and Scandinavian skalds who wrote verses praising their paymaster . Amla\u00edb was married at least twice , and had many children who married into Irish and Scandinavian royal families .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dublin": "Vikings invaded the territory around Dublin in the 9th century , establishing the Norse Kingdom of Dublin , the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland . Its territory corresponded to most of present-day County Dublin . The Norse referred to the kingdom as Dyflin , which is derived from Irish Dubh Linn , meaning 'black pool ' . The first reference to the Vikings comes from the Annals of Ulster and the first entry for 841 AD reads : Pagans still on Lough Neagh . It is from this date onward that historians get references to ship fortresses or longphorts being established in Ireland . It may be safe to assume that the Vikings first over-wintered in 840-841 AD . The actual location of the longphort of Dublin is still a hotly debated issue . Norse rulers of Dublin were often co-kings , and occasionally also Kings of J\u00f3rv\u00edk in what is now Yorkshire . Under their rule , Dublin became the biggest slave port in Western Europe . Over time , the settlers in Dublin became increasingly Gaelicized . They began to exhibit a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism , and are often referred to as Norse-Gaels . The extent of the kingdom varied , but in peaceful times it extended roughly as far as Wicklow ( Wykinglo ) in the south , Glen Ding near Blessington , Leixlip ( Lax Hlaup ) west of Dublin , and Skerries , Dublin ( Skere ) to the north .",
  "/wiki/Northumbria": "The Kingdom of Northumbria ( /n\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8\u03b8\u028cmbri\u0259/ ; Old English : Nor\u00feanhymbra R\u012b\u010be ; Latin : Regnum Northanhymbrorum ) was a medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now Northern England and south-east Scotland . The name derives from the Old English Nor\u00fean-hymbre meaning the people or province north of the Humber , which reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom 's territory , the Humber Estuary . Northumbria started to consolidate into one kingdom in the early seventh century , when the two earlier core territories of Deira and Bernicia entered into a dynastic union . At its height , the kingdom extended from the Humber , Peak District and the River Mersey on the south to the Firth of Forth ( now in Scotland ) on the north . Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century , though a rump Earldom of Bamburgh survived around Bernicia in the north , later to be absorbed into the medieval kingdoms of Scotland and England . Today , Northumbria usually refers to a smaller region corresponding to the counties of Northumberland , County Durham and Tyne and Wear in North East England . The term is used in the names of some North East regional institutions , particularly the Northumbria Police ( which covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear ) , Northumbria University ( based in Newcastle upon Tyne ) , the Northumbria Army Cadet Force , and the regionalist Northumbrian Association . The local Environment Agency office , located in Newcastle Business Park , also uses the term Northumbria to describe its area . However , the term is not the official name for the UK and EU region of North East England .",

Iona Abbey was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for three centuries and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment . It is a tourist destination and a place for spiritual retreats . Its modern Scottish Gaelic name means Iona of ( Saint ) Columba ( formerly anglicised Icolmkill ) .",
  "/wiki/Maccus_mac_Arailt": "Maccus mac Arailt ( fl . 971-974 ) was a tenth-century King of the Isles . [ note 1 ] Although his parentage is uncertain , surviving evidence suggests that he was the son of Aralt mac Sitriuc , King of Limerick . Maccus ' family is known as the Meic Arailt kindred . He and his brother , Gofraid , are first recorded in the 970s . It was during this decade and the next that they conducted military operations against the Welsh of Anglesey , apparently taking advantage of dynastic strife within the Kingdom of Gwynedd . The Meic Arailt violence during this period could account for Maccus ' participation in a royal assembly convened by Edgar , King of the English . Maccus may have been regarded as a potential threat by not only the English and Welsh kings , but also the rulers of the Kingdom of Strathclyde . Perhaps as a conseuqnece of this convention , the Meic Arailt thereafter turned their attention to Ireland . In 974 , Maccus defeated and captured \u00cdmar , King of Limerick . Gofraid resumed the family 's campaigning against the Welsh before the end of the decade . In 984 , the Meic Arailt appear to have formed an alliance with the family of Brian mac Cenn\u00e9tig , King of Munster .",

He was the younger son of Edmund I and \u00c6lfgifu of Shaftesbury , and came to the throne as a teenager , following the death of his older brother Eadwig . As king , Edgar further consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors , with his reign being noted for its relative stability . His most trusted advisor was Dunstan , whom he recalled from exile and made Archbishop of Canterbury . The pinnacle of Edgar 's reign was his coronation at Bath in 973 , which was organised by Dunstan and forms the basis for the current coronation ceremony . After his death he was succeeded by his son Edward , although the succession was disputed .",

  "/wiki/Gilli_(Hebridean_earl)": "Gilli was an eleventh-century Hebridean chieftain whose career coincided with an era of Orcadian overlordship in the Kingdom of the Isles . According to mediaeval saga-tradition , Gilli was a brother-in-law of Sigur\u00f0r Hl\u01eb\u00f0visson , Earl of Orkney , having married the latter 's sister Hvarfl\u01eb\u00f0 . Traditionally regarded as one of the most powerful Orcadian earls , Sigur\u00f0r appears to have extended his authority into the Isles in the late tenth century . Gilli apparently acted as Sigur\u00f0r 's viceroy or tributary earl in the region . The time frame of Gilli 's apparent authority in the Isles is uncertain , and may date as early as the reign of Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Haraldsson , King of the Isles , or as late as the period following the death of this man 's eventual successor , R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson , King of the Isles . Gilli 's name is probably Gaelic in origin , and he seems to have seated himself on either Coll or Colonsay , islands in the Inner Hebrides . It is possible that Gilli is identical to Gilla Ciar\u00e1in mac Gl\u00fan Iairn , an U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynast who was slain at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 . If not , another possibility is that he was the father of a certain Conamal/Conm\u00e1el who was killed in 980 .",
  "/wiki/Sigurd_the_Stout": "Sigurd Hlodvirsson ( circa 960 - 23 April 1014 ) , popularly known as Sigurd the Stout from the Old Norse Sigur\u00f0r digri , was an Earl of Orkney . The main sources for his life are the Norse Sagas , which were first written down some two centuries or more after his death . These engaging stories must therefore be treated with caution rather than as reliable historical documents . [ Note 1 ] Sigurd was the son of Hlodvir Thorfinnson and ( according to the Norse sagas ) a direct descendant of Torf-Einarr Rognvaldson . Sigurd 's tenure as earl was apparently free of the kin-strife that beset some other incumbents of this title and he was able to pursue his military ambitions over a wide area . He also held lands in the north of mainland Scotland and in the Sudr\u00f8yar , and he may have been instrumental in the defeat of Gofraid mac Arailt , King of the Isles . The Annals of Ulster record his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 , the earliest known reference to the earldom of Orkney . The saga tales draw attention to Sigurd 's conversion to Christianity and his use of a totemic raven banner , a symbol of the Norse God Odin . This ambiguous theme and the lack of detailed contemporary records of his life have led to a variety of interpretations of the saga material by modern scholars .",
  "/wiki/Earl_of_Orkney": "The Earl of Orkney was originally a Norse jarl ruling the archipelagos of Orkney and Shetland ( Nor\u00f0reyjar ) . Originally founded by Norse invaders , the status of the rulers of the Nor\u00f0reyjar as Norwegian vassals was formalised in 1195 . Although the Old Norse term jarl is etymologically related to earl , and the jarls were succeeded by earls in the late 15th century , a Norwegian jarl is not the same thing . In the Norse context the distinction between jarls and kings did not become significant until the late 11th century and the early jarls would therefore have had considerable independence of action until that time . The position of Jarl of Orkney was eventually the most senior rank in mediaeval Norway except for the king himself . The jarls were periodically subject to the kings of Alba for those parts of their territory in what is now mainland Scotland ( i.e . Caithness and Sutherland ) . In 1232 , a Scottish dynasty descended from the Mormaers of Angus replaced the previous family descended from the late 10th century jarl Torf-Einarr , although the Nor\u00f0reyjar remained formally subject to Norway . This family was in turn replaced by the descendants of the Mormaers of Strathearn and later still by the Sinclair family , during whose time Orkney and Shetland became part of Scotland . The second earldom was created by James VI of Scotland in 1581 for his half-uncle Robert Stewart but after only two incumbents the title was forfeited in 1614 . After the third creation of 1696 , which title still exists today , the earls ' influence on Orcadian affairs became negligible .",
  "/wiki/Mormaer_of_Caithness": "The Mormaer of Caithness was a vassal title mostly held by members of the Norwegian nobility based in Orkney from the Viking Age until 1350 . The mormaerdom was held as fief of Scotland and the title was frequently held by the Norse Earls of Orkney , who were thus a vassal of both the King of Norway and the King of Scots . There is no other example in the history of either Norway or of Scotland in which a dynasty of earls owed their allegiance to two different kings . The earliest reference to the title is however to that of a native Scots ruler , Donnchad , although the extent of the Scottish crown 's influence so far north at the time , beyond the lands of the powerful Mormaers of Moray , is questionable . The Norse saga which mentions Donnchad does not provide a date , although the context suggests the early tenth century . Nonetheless , at least since the childhood of Thorfinn Sigurdsson in c. 1020 , but possibly already several decades before , the Earls of Orkney were the controlling figures . In the Norse context the distinction between earls and kings did not become significant until the late 11th century and the Caithness mormaers therefore would have had considerable independence of action until that time .",
  "/wiki/Ragnall_mac_Gofraid": "Ragnall mac Gofraid ( died 1004/1005 ) was King of the Isles and likely a member of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair kindred .

Ragnall and Gofraid flourished at a time when the Kingdom of the Isles seems to have suffered from Orcadian encroachment at the hands of Sigur\u00f0r Hl\u01eb\u00f0visson , Earl of Orkney . Gofraid died in 989 . Although Ragnall is accorded the kingship upon his own death in 1004 or 1005 , the succession after his father 's death is uncertain . During his career , Ragnall may have contended with Gilli , an apparent Hebridean rival who was closely aligned with Sigur\u00f0r . Another possible opponent of Ragnall may have been Sveinn Haraldsson , King of Denmark who attacked Mann in 955 . This man is recorded to have been exiled from Scandinavia at one point in his career , and to have found shelter with a certain rex Scothorum , a monarch that could refer to Ragnall himself . Whatever the case , Mann also fell prey to \u00c6thelr\u00e6d II , King of the English in 1000 . Both military operations may have been the retaliation .

When Earl Sigurd was killed at the Battle of Clontarf , he left four sons : Einar , Brusi , Sumarlidi , and Thorfinn . Thorfinn was only a child , whereas his three brothers were grown men , so the Earldom was divided between the three older brothers . Thorfinn , the only child by his fathers union with the daughter of Malcolm II of Scotland , was appointed to be titular ruler of the Mormaerdom of Caithness by his grandfather . The Orkneyinga Saga describes Einar as ruthless and grasping , a hard and successful fighting man and that he made no compromises and stood no arguments . He was a great bully . Einar raided abroad often , calling on the farmers for levies and taxes . The raids brought little plunder and the frequent absences of the farmers caused shortage and famine in Einar 's lands .

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own , and the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , this legacy was lost . He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide , which often misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers , contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour . As a Danish prince , Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe . Scotland submitted to him in 1017 . His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together . Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom , as well as through sheer brutality . After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia , Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028 . The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut ( he had coins struck there that called him king , but there is no narrative record of his occupation ) . Dominion of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland , where Cnut , like his father before him , had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse-Gaels . Cnut 's possession of England 's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire 's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great prestige and leverage within the Catholic Church and among the magnates of Christendom ( gaining notable concessions such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops , though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium , as well as on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome ) . After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden , and on his way back from Rome where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor , Cnut , in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects , deemed himself King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes .",

Thorfinn married Ingibiorg Finnsdottir , daughter of Finn Arnesson , Jarl of Halland . The Heimskringla of Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson , and the anonymous compiler of the Orkneyinga Saga wrote that Thorfinn was the most powerful of all the earls of Orkney and that he ruled substantial territories beyond the Northern Isles .

There is also uncertainty as to which family Gofraid mac Sitriuc belonged to . One such family , descended from Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n , King of Northumbria and Dublin , appears to have cooperated with Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3 , King of Leinster . Another family , that of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill , King of Dublin and the Isles , opposed Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n 's apparent descendants , and was closely connected with Diarmait 's adversaries , the U\u00ed Briain kindred . If Gofraid mac Sitriuc was a descendant of Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n , it could mean that he was installed in the Isles by Diarmait after the latter oversaw the apparent expulsion of Echmarcach in the 1060s . Membership of this family may also explain apparent amiable relationship that Gofraid mac Sitriuc and Fingal appear to have enjoyed with Gofraid Crob\u00e1n , their immediate successor in the Isles . It could also explain an attack on Mann in 1073 , conducted by a possible the U\u00ed Briain and a possible kinsman of Echmarcach . On the other hand , if Gofraid mac Sitriuc was a close kinsman of Echmarcach , it is possible that he is identical to Gofraid ua Ragnaill , King of Dublin , a contemporary ruler who is known to have reigned in Dublin during a period of U\u00ed Briain overlordship after Diarmait 's death . This identification could mean that Gofraid ua Ragnaill immediately succeeded Echmarcach in both Dublin and the Isles . Gofraid mac Sitriuc is stated in one source to have died in about 1070 , after which Fingal succeeded him .

  "/wiki/Godred_Crovan": "Godred Crovan ( died 1095 ) , known in Gaelic as Gofraid Crob\u00e1n , Gofraid Mer\u00e1nach , and Gofraid M\u00e9r\u00e1nach , [ note 1 ] was a Norse-Gaelic ruler of the kingdoms of Dublin and the Isles . Although his precise parentage is uncertain , he was very likely an U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynast , and probably a descendant of Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n , King of Northumbria and Dublin . Godred first appears on record in the context of supporting the Norwegian invasion of England in 1066 . Following the collapse of this campaign , Godred is recorded to have arrived on Mann , at the court of Gofraid mac Sitriuc , King of the Isles , a likely kinsman of his . During the 1070s , the latter died and was succeeded by his son , Fingal . Within the decade , Godred violently seized the kingship for himself , although the exact circumstances surrounding this takeover are uncertain . By 1091 , Godred attained the kingship of Dublin , and thereby secured complete control of the valuable trade routes through the Irish Sea region . Godred 's expansion may be further perceptible in the Clyde estuary and Galloway , and may well have forced the English to consolidate control of Cumberland in an effort to secure their western maritime flank . Godred appears to have drawn his power from the Hebrides ; and archaeological evidence from Mann reveals that , in comparison to the decades previous to his takeover , the island seems to have enjoyed a period of relative peace . During his reign , Godred appears to have lent military assistance to Gruffudd ap Cynan , King of Gwynedd , a probable kinsman , who was then locked in continuous conflicts with Welsh rivals and encroaching English magnates . The earliest known Bishops of the Isles date from about the time of Godred 's reign , although it is almost certain that earlier ecclesiastes held this position . It may have been just prior to Godred 's accession in the Isles , whilst Dublin was under the ultimate control of Toirdelbach Ua Briain , King of Munster , that Dublin and the Isles were ecclesiastically separated once and for all .",
  "/wiki/L\u01ebgma\u00f0r_Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson": "L\u01ebgma\u00f0r Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson ( pronounced [ \u02c8l\u0252\u0263ma\u00f0r \u02c8\u0261u\u00f0ru\u00f0arsson ] ) was a late eleventh-century King of the Isles , whose rise , reign , and fall from power are obscure . [ note 1 ] He was the eldest son of Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Crovan , King of Dublin and the Isles , a Norse-Gaelic dynast who conquered and ruled the kingdoms of the Isles and Dublin , before dying in 1095 . Three years after the latter 's death , the Isles was conquered by Magn\u00fas \u00d3l\u00e1fsson , King of Norway , whose regime in the region lasted until his death in 1103 . The chronology of L\u01ebgma\u00f0r 's reign is uncertain : he may have begun his reign either before Magn\u00fas ' conquest , during his regime , or after his demise . As King of the Isles , L\u01ebgma\u00f0r faced significant opposition from factions supporting his younger brothers , Haraldr and \u00d3l\u00e1fr . At some point , the Islesmen are reported to have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain , King of Munster to select a temporary ruler in the region . This act may have been initiated on behalf of a faction supporting \u00d3l\u00e1fr . Whatever the case , Ua Briain responded by placing an U\u00ed Briain relative upon the throne . The U\u00ed Briain interlopers , however , do not appear to have been well received ; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen , perhaps led by supporters of L\u01ebgma\u00f0r himself . The chronology and circumstances surrounding the conclusion of L\u01ebgma\u00f0r 's reign are uncertain . According to one source , he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died . This account could be evidence that he died on crusade : one possibility is the First Crusade , perhaps in the entourage of Robert II , Duke of Normandy ; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade , in the entourage of Sigur\u00f0r Magn\u00fasson , King of Norway ."
