  "/wiki/The_Dunwich_Horror_(film)": "The Dunwich Horror is a 1970 American supernatural horror film directed by Daniel Haller , and starring Sandra Dee , Dean Stockwell , and Ed Begley . A loose adaptation of the short story of the same name by H.P . Lovecraft , the film focuses on a young female graduate student who is targeted by a man attempting to use her in an occult ritual with the Necronomicon . The screenplay was co-written by Curtis Hanson , while Roger Corman served as an executive producer on the film . The film 's distributor , American International Pictures , had tentatively planned an adaptation of the Lovecraft story in 1963 . Executive producer Corman hired Haller to direct , as he had previously directed several features for him , including Devil 's Angels ( 1967 ) . Though set in the fiction town of Arkham , Massachusetts , principal photography of The Dunwich Horror took place in and around Mendocino , California in the spring of 1969 . The film marked Sandra Dee 's first adult role , following the break in her contract with Universal Pictures , and she envisioned the picture as a major departure from the wholesome image she had cultivated as a child actor . The Dunwich Horror premiered in Chicago in January 1970 , and screened throughout the country that year , as well as internationally . Critical response was divided , with some critics praising the film 's technical elements and adaptation of the source material , while others felt the performances were ineffective , and the film generally mediocre . Despite this , some contemporary film scholars , such as Alain Silver , have championed the film as one of the best film adaptations of a Lovecraft literary work . Film historian Rob Craig similarly deemed it one of the most overall successful adaptations of a Lovecraft source work ever committed to film .",
