  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
  "/wiki/Thomas_Graham_Jackson": "Sir Thomas Graham Jackson , 1st Baronet RA ( 21 December 1835 - 7 November 1924 ) was one of the most distinguished English architects of his generation . He is best remembered for his work at Oxford for Oxford Military College as well as the University , notably : the Examination Schools , most of Hertford College ( including the Bridge of Sighs over New College Lane ) , much of Brasenose College , ranges at Trinity College and Somerville College , and the Acland Nursing Home in North Oxford . Much of his career was devoted to the architecture of education and he worked extensively for various schools , notably Giggleswick and his own alma mater Brighton College . Jackson designed the former town hall in Tipperary Town , Ireland . He also worked on many parish churches and the college chapel at the University of Wales , Lampeter . He is also famous for designing the chapel ( amongst other things ) at Radley College . The former City of Oxford High School for Boys in George Street , Oxford , Oxford is another building designed by him . He was educated at Brighton College and then Wadham College , Oxford , of which he wrote a history , before being articled as a pupil to Sir George Gilbert Scott . Jackson was a prolific author of carefully researched works in architectural history , often illustrated with sketches made during his extensive travels . Jackson 's travels in Dalmatia , in which he was accompanied by his intrepid wife , would result in Dalmatia , the Quarnero and Istria with Cettigne in Montenegro and the island of Grado ( 3 volumes ) , published by the Clarendon Press , Oxford , in 1887 . It remains today a fundamental source of knowledge of the geography , art , architecture and social life of Dalmatia in those years . He and Norman Shaw edited Architecture , A Profession or an Art published in 1892 , to which William H. White replied by publishing The Architect and his artists , an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80 % of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent",
  "/wiki/Manse": "A manse ( /\u02c8m\u00e6ns/ ) is a clergy house inhabited by , or formerly inhabited by , a minister , usually used in the context of Presbyterian , Methodist , Baptist and other Christian traditions . Ultimately derived from the Latin mansus , dwelling , from manere , to remain , by the 16th century the term meant both a dwelling and , in ecclesiastical contexts , the amount of land needed to support a single family . Many notable Scots have been called sons ( or daughters ) of the manse , and the term is a recurring point of reference within Scottish media and culture . For example , former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was described as a son of the manse as he is the son of a Presbyterian minister . When selling a former manse , the Church of Scotland always requires that the property should not be called The Manse by the new owners , but The Old Manse or some other acceptable variation . The intended result is that The Manse refers to a working building rather than simply applying as a name",

Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane . The term dormer is commonly used to refer to a dormer window although a dormer does not necessarily contain a window . A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion . As a prominent element of many buildings , different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture . When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals , it is usually referred to as a lucarne",
  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan",

Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides",

Besides his most famous public buildings he designed other town halls , the Manchester Assize buildings bombed in World War II and the adjacent Strangeways Prison . He also designed several hospitals , the most architecturally interesting being the Royal Infirmary Liverpool and University College Hospital London . He was particularly active in designing buildings for universities , including both Oxford and Cambridge but also what became Liverpool , Manchester and Leeds universities . He designed many country houses , the most important being Eaton Hall in Cheshire , largely demolished in 1961-63 . He designed several bank buildings and offices for insurance companies , most notably the Prudential Assurance Company . Although not a major church designer he produced several notable churches and chapels . He was both a member of The Royal Institute of British Architects , of which he served a term as President , and a Royal Academician , acting as Treasurer for the Royal Academy .

  "/wiki/Alabaster": "Alabaster is a mineral or rock that is soft , often used for carving , and is processed for plaster powder . Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from geologists . The former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals : the fine-grained massive type of gypsum and the fine-grained banded type of calcite . Geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type . Chemically , gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium , while calcite is a carbonate of calcium . Both types of alabaster have similar properties . They are usually lightly colored , translucent , and soft stones . They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts . The calcite type is also denominated onyx-marble , Egyptian alabaster , and Oriental alabaster and is geologically described as either a compact banded travertine or a stalagmitic limestone marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown . Onyx-marble is a traditional , but geologically inaccurate , name because both onyx and marble have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of alabaster",
  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window . The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors ' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out . There are two main types , plate tracery and the later bar tracery . The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery .

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958",

A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof",

  "/wiki/Octavia_Hill": "Octavia Hill ( 3 December 1838 - 13 August 1912 ) was an English social reformer , whose main concern was the welfare of the inhabitants of cities , especially London , in the second half of the nineteenth century . Born into a family with a strong commitment to alleviating poverty , she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father 's businesses . With no formal schooling , she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people . Hill was a moving force behind the development of social housing , and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment . She believed in self-reliance , and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves . She was opposed to municipal provision of housing , believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal . Another of Hill 's concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people . She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands , and helped to save London 's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on . She was one of the three founders of the National Trust , set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public . She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society ( now the charity Family Action ) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work . She was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905 . Hill 's legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust , several housing projects still run on her lines , a tradition of training for housing managers , and the Octavia Hill Birthplace House established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace in Wisbech",

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia",
