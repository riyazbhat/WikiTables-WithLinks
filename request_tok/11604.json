  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",

  "/wiki/Thunder_Bay_River": "The Thunder Bay River is a 75.4-mile-long ( 121.3 km ) river in the U.S. state of Michigan . It drains much of Alpena County and Montmorency County , and a small portion of Oscoda County , into Thunder Bay on the eastern side of northern Michigan . The mouth of the river is in the heart of downtown Alpena and is guarded by the Alpena Light Station . Unlike many of Michigan 's rivers , the Thunder Bay River drops considerably from its headwaters in southwestern Montmorency County to Lake Huron . A hill near the headwaters northeast of Lewiston is 1,270 feet ( 390 m ) above sea level and 689 feet ( 210 m ) above lake level . A former whitewater stretch northwest of Alpena , the Long Rapids , carried the river down from the northern Michigan plateau to Thunder Bay . The rapids have since been drowned under Lake Winyah , also known as Seven Mile Pond ( see map in external links hereafter ) , a hydroelectric reservoir created by the Norway Dam ( also known as Seven Mile Dam ) . Much of the middle and upper reaches of the Thunder Bay River flow through the Mackinaw State Forest , which is a large swathe of northeastern Michigan that , after logging was completed in the 1910s , reverted to the state for unpaid property taxes . The state forest contains large numbers of aspen and birch trees , pulpwood trees typical of second-growth Michigan forests . The largest reservoir in the Thunder Bay River basin , the 8,500-acre ( 3,400 ha ) Fletcher Pond ( also called Fletcher Floodwaters ) in western Alpena County , began to fill in 1932 . It is noted for having the second largest population of ospreys in the Midwest . As of 2006 , pond riparian property owners were actively trying to counter an exotic infestation of Eurasian watermilfoil .",

It was probably derived from the Native American name , as they believed that the Bay was peculiarly subject to thunder storms . There are a substantial number of shipwrecks in and around Thunder Bay . Diving is an important activity .",

  "/wiki/Tugboat": "A tugboat or tug is a type of vessel that maneuvers other vessels by pushing or pulling them either by direct contact or by means of a tow line . Tugs typically move vessels that either are restricted in their ability to maneuver on their own , such as ships in a crowded harbor or a narrow canal , or those that can not move by themselves , such as barges , disabled ships , log rafts , or oil platforms . Tugboats are powerful for their size and strongly built , and some are ocean-going . Some tugboats serve as icebreakers or salvage boats . Early tugboats had steam engines , but today most have diesel engines . Many tugboats have firefighting monitors , allowing them to assist in firefighting , especially in harbors .",

  "/wiki/Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows": "The Independent Order of Odd Fellows ( IOOF ) is a non-political and non-sectarian international fraternal order of Odd Fellowship . It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore , Maryland , United States . Evolving from the Order of Odd Fellows founded in England during the 1700s , the IOOF was originally chartered by the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity in England but has operated as an independent organization since 1842 , although it maintains an inter-fraternal relationship with the English Order . The order is also known as the Triple Link Fraternity , referring to the order 's Triple Links symbol , alluding to its motto Friendship , Love and Truth . While several unofficial Odd Fellows lodges had existed in New York City circa 1806-1818 , because of its charter relationship , the American Odd Fellows is regarded as being founded with Washington Lodge No 1 in Baltimore at the Seven Stars Tavern on April 26 , 1819 , by Thomas Wildey along with some associates who assembled in response to an advertisement in the New Republic . The following year , the lodge affiliated with the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity and was granted the authority to institute new lodges . Previously , Wildey had joined the Grand United Order of Oddfellows ( 1798- ) in 1804 but followed through with the split of Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity ( 1810- ) before immigrating to the United States in 1817 . In 1842 , after an elementary dispute on authority , the American Lodges formed a governing system separate from the English Order , and in 1843 assumed the name Independent Order of Odd Fellows . The Independent Order of Odd Fellows became the first fraternity in the United States to include both men and women when it adopted the Beautiful Rebekah Degree on September 20 , 1851 , by initiative of Schuyler Colfax , later Vice-President of the United States . Beyond fraternal and recreational activities , the Independent Order of Odd Fellows promotes the ethic of reciprocity and charity , by implied inspiration of Judeo-Christian ethics . The largest Sovereign Grand Lodge of all fraternal orders of Odd Fellows since the 19th century , it enrolls some 600,000 members divided in approximately 10,000 lodges in 26 countries , inter-fraternally recognised by the second largest , the British-seated Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity .",

  "/wiki/Great_Lakes": "The Great Lakes ( French : les Grands Lacs ) , also called the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Great Lakes of North America , are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America , on the Canada-United States border , which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River . They comprise Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron , Erie , and Ontario . Hydrologically , there are only four lakes , because Lakes Michigan and Huron join at the Straits of Mackinac . The lakes form the Great Lakes Waterway . The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing 21 % of the world 's surface fresh water by volume . The total surface is 94,250 square miles ( 244,106 km2 ) , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is 5,439 cubic miles ( 22,671 km3 ) , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal ( 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3 , 22-23 % of the world 's surface fresh water ) . Due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas . Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater . The lakes have been a major source for transportation , migration , trade , and fishing , serving as a habitat to many aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity . The surrounding region is called the Great Lakes region , which includes the Great Lakes Megalopolis .",
