  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy": "The Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ; French : Marine royale canadienne ) is the naval force of Canada . The RCN is one of three environmental ( land - army , sea - navy , and air - air force ) commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces . As of 2017 [ update ] , The Royal Canadian Navy operates 12 frigates , 4 attack submarines , 12 coastal defence vessels and 8 patrol/training vessels , as well as several auxiliary vessels . The Royal Canadian Navy consists of 8,500 Regular Force and 5,100 Primary Reserve sailors , supported by 5,300 civilians .

In 2011 , its historical title of Royal Canadian Navy was restored . Over the course of its history , the RCN has served in the First and Second World Wars , the Korean War , the Persian Gulf War , the War in Afghanistan and numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations .",
  "/wiki/Flower-class_corvette": "The Flower-class corvette ( also referred to as the Gladiolus class after the lead ship ) was a British class of 294 corvettes used during World War II , specifically with the Allied navies as anti-submarine convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic . Royal Navy ships of this class were named after flowers , hence the name of the class . The majority served during World War II with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) . Several ships built largely in Canada were transferred from the RN to the United States Navy ( USN ) under the lend-lease programme , seeing service in both navies . Some corvettes transferred to the USN were manned by the US Coast Guard . The vessels serving with the US Navy were known as Temptress and Action-class patrol gunboats . Other Flower-class corvettes served with the Free French Naval Forces , the Royal Netherlands Navy , the Royal Norwegian Navy , the Royal Indian Navy , the Royal Hellenic Navy , the Royal New Zealand Navy , the Royal Yugoslav Navy , and , immediately post-war , the South African Navy . After World War II many surplus Flower-class vessels saw worldwide use in other navies , as well as civilian use . HMCS Sackville is the only member of the class to be preserved as a museum ship .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Artifex_(F28)": "HMS Artifex was a repair ship of the Royal Navy from late in the Second World War and into the Cold War . Launched as the Cunard liner RMS Aurania she was requisitioned on the outbreak of war to serve as an armed merchant cruiser . Damaged by a U-boat while sailing with an Atlantic convoy , she was purchased outright and converted to a floating workshop , spending the rest of her life as a support ship for the navy .",
  "/wiki/Armed_merchantman": "An armed merchantman is a merchant ship equipped with guns , usually for defensive purposes , either by design or after the fact . In the days of sail , piracy and privateers , many merchantmen would be routinely armed , especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade . In more modern times , auxiliary cruisers were used offensively as merchant raiders to disrupt trade chiefly during both World War I and World War II , particularly by Germany . While armed merchantmen are clearly inferior to regular warships , sometimes they have scored successes in combat against them . Examples include East Indiamen mimicking ships of the line and chasing off regular French warships in the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804 , and the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran sinking the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in their battle in 1941 , although Kormoran was also destroyed and had to be scuttled .",

  "/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare": "Anti-submarine warfare ( ASW , or in older form A/S ) is a branch of underwater warfare that uses surface warships , aircraft , or other submarines to find , track , and deter , damage , or destroy enemy submarines . Successful anti-submarine warfare depends on a mix of sensor and weapon technology , training , and experience . Sophisticated sonar equipment for first detecting , then classifying , locating , and tracking the target submarine is a key element of ASW . To destroy submarines , both torpedoes and naval mines are used , launched from air , surface , and underwater platforms . ASW also involves protecting friendly ships .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(1914)": "HMS Ark Royal was the first ship designed and built as a seaplane carrier . She was purchased by the Royal Navy in 1914 shortly after her keel had been laid and the ship was only in frames ; this allowed the ship 's design to be modified almost totally to accommodate seaplanes . In the First World War , Ark Royal participated in the Gallipoli Campaign in early 1915 , with her aircraft conducting aerial reconnaissance and observation missions . Her aircraft later supported British troops on the Macedonian Front in 1916 , before she returned to the Dardanelles to act as a depot ship for all the seaplanes operating in the area . In January 1918 , several of her aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben when she sortied from the Dardanelles to attack Allied ships in the area . The ship left the area later in the year to support seaplanes conducting anti-submarine patrols over the southern Aegean Sea . After the end of the war , Ark Royal mostly served as an aircraft transport and depot ship for those aircraft in support of White Russian and British operations against the Bolsheviks in the Caspian and Black Sea regions during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . She also supported Royal Air Force ( RAF ) aircraft in British Somaliland in the campaign against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan in 1920 . Later that year , the ship was placed in reserve . Ark Royal was recommissioned to ferry an RAF squadron to the Dardanelles during the Chanak Crisis in 1922 . She was reduced to reserve again upon her return to the United Kingdom the following year . Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 to serve as a training ship , for seaplane pilots and to evaluate aircraft catapult operations and techniques .",
  "/wiki/Seaplane_tender": "A seaplane tender is a boat or ship that supports the operation of seaplanes .
