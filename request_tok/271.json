  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

Therefore , Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years . The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff . The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world 's great powers , including the Seven Years ' War , the Napoleonic Wars , the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars . Britain 's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world 's leading military and economic powers .

At roughly 8:45 am , she collided at low speed , approximately one knot ( 1.2 mph or 1.9 km/h ) , with the unladen Imo , chartered by the Commission for Relief in Belgium to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York . On the Mont-Blanc , the impact damaged benzol barrels stored on deck , leaking vapors which were ignited by sparks from the collision , setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control . Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35 am , the Mont-Blanc exploded . Nearly all structures within an 800-metre ( half-mile ) radius , including the community of Richmond , were obliterated . A pressure wave snapped trees , bent iron rails , demolished buildings , grounded vessels ( including Imo , which was washed ashore by the ensuing tsunami ) , and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres . Across the harbour , in Dartmouth , there was also widespread damage . A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of the Mi'kmaq First Nation who had lived in the Tufts Cove area for generations .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

He chose to become an engineer , and attended the University of Illinois , where he was a member and President of the Engineers ' Club , and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering in 1888 . He then worked in a series of positions , as an assistant engineer at the Union Pacific Railroad and Pacific Shortline from 1888 to 1890 , as assistant to Civil Engineer Elmer Lawrence Cathell from 1890 to 1892 , as a Chief Draftsman in the West Office of the Pittsburg Bridge Company from 1892 to 1896 , and Assistant Bridge Engineer and Acting Division Engineer for the Chicago and North Western Railroad from 1900 to 1903 .

Nies . Bush designed the tracks and sheds for the Lackawanna 's Hoboken Terminal , the head house of which was designed by architect Kenneth Murchison . In place of the wide-span balloon roofs used at major terminals up to that time , Bush developed and patented a modular style of train shed known as Bush-style sheds , constructed of cast iron , steel and concrete , incorporating a vent over the tracks to allow steam and smoke to escape and skylights over the passenger platforms for illumination . Bush sheds were cheaper and easier to construct than balloon roofs , and were adopted for use at several major terminals in the years immediately following . Bush led planning of the Lackawanna Cutoff , a huge project to eliminate curves , hills , and grade crossings , although construction was completed after he left the railroad . Bush resigned from the DL & W in 1909 to become a partner in the civil engineering consulting firm Flickwir and Bush .",

Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art .

The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style .
