It is unknown when the valley was first inhabited but it is known to have been settled in pre-Incan times as the city of Liribamba , the capital of the ancient Puruh\u00e1 people . As the Incan empire expanded , the region became an area of conquest and was fully under the control of the Inca by the time of Wayna Qhapaq .

After a drawn-out series of engagements with the conquistadors , who allied with the Ca\u00f1ari ( recently conquered Incan subjects ) , Rumi\u00f1awi , faced with the prospect of near-certain defeat , ordered the city of Liribamba burned and the treasures of the Incas hidden or destroyed . Within the month ( August 1534 ) , Spanish conquistador Diego de Almagro founded a new city on the ashes of Liribamba which he named Santiago de Quito , the first city founded by the Spanish . By the end of the year , Incan resistance had collapsed , culminating in a battle at Mount Chimborazo , and Rumi\u00f1ahui was captured .
