  "/wiki/African-American": "African Americans ( also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa . The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry . According to U.S. Census Bureau data , African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American . The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 . Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens .

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

A total of 30 teams play in Major League Baseball : 15 teams in the National League ( NL ) and 15 in the American League ( AL ) . The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901 , respectively . Beginning in 1903 , the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities . In 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball . MLB also oversees Minor League Baseball , which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the major league clubs . MLB and the World Baseball Softball Confederation jointly manage the international World Baseball Classic tournament . Baseball 's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings founded in 1869 . Before that , some teams had secretly paid some players .

  "/wiki/No-hitter": "In baseball , a no-hitter ( also known as a no-hit game and colloquially as a no-no ) is a game in which a team was not able to record a single hit . Major League Baseball ( MLB ) officially defines a no-hitter as a completed game in which a team that batted in at least nine innings recorded no hits . A pitcher who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is said to have thrown a no-hitter . This is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff - only 303 have been thrown in MLB history since 1876 , an average of about two per year . In most cases , no-hitters are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game ; one thrown by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter . The most recent major league no-hitter by a single pitcher was thrown on September 1 , 2019 , by Justin Verlander of the Houston Astros against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre . The most recent combined no-hitter was thrown on August 3 , 2019 , by Aaron Sanchez , Will Harris , Joe Biagini , and Chris Devenski of the Astros against the Seattle Mariners at Minute Maid Park . It is possible to reach base without a hit , most commonly by a walk , error , or being hit by a pitch . Other possibilities include the batter reaching first after an uncaught third strike or catcher 's interference . A no-hitter in which no batters reach base at all is a perfect game , a much rarer feat . Because batters can reach base by means other than a hit , a pitcher can throw a no-hitter ( though not a perfect game ) and still give up runs , and even lose the game , although this is extremely uncommon , and most no-hitters are also shutouts . One or more runs were given up in 25 recorded no-hitters in MLB history , most recently by Ervin Santana of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a 3-1 win against the Cleveland Indians on July 27 , 2011 .",

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

Perry . Perry served in the West Indies during the Quasi War of 1798-1800 against France , in the Mediterranean during the Barbary Wars of 1801-1815 , and in the Caribbean fighting piracy and the slave trade , but is most noted for his heroic role in the War of 1812 during the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie . During the war against Britain , Perry supervised the building of a fleet at Erie , Pennsylvania . He earned the title Hero of Lake Erie for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie , receiving a Congressional Gold Medal and the Thanks of Congress . His leadership materially aided the successful outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories , and the victory was a turning point in the battle for the west in the war . He is remembered for the words on his battle flag , Do n't Give Up the Ship , which was a tribute to the dying command of his colleague Captain James Lawrence of USS Chesapeake . He is also known for his message to General William Henry Harrison which reads in part , We have met the enemy and they are ours ; . Perry became embroiled in a long-standing and bitter controversy with the commander of USS Niagara , Captain Jesse Elliott , over their conduct in the Battle of Lake Erie , and both were the subject of official charges . In 1815 , he successfully commanded Java in the Mediterranean during the Second Barbary War .

While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution , the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection . The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain , ending the Spanish-American War . Fighting erupted between forces of the United States and those of the Philippine Republic on February 4 , 1899 , in what became known as the 1899 Battle of Manila . On June 2 , 1899 , the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States . The war officially ended on July 2 , 1902 , with a victory for the United States . However , some Philippine groups - led by veterans of the Katipunan , a Philippine revolutionary society - continued to battle the American forces for several more years . Among those leaders was General Macario Sakay , a veteran Katipunan member who assumed the presidency of the proclaimed Tagalog Republic , formed in 1902 after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo . Other groups , including the Moro , Bicol , and Pulahan peoples , continued hostilities in remote areas and islands , until their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15 , 1913 . The war resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 Filipino civilians , mostly due to famine and disease . Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million . The war , and especially the following occupation by the U.S. , changed the culture of the islands , leading to the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines as a state religion , and the introduction of English to the islands as the primary language of government , education , business , industry , and , in future decades , among upper-class families and educated individuals .",

The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown , Massachusetts , which was peripherally involved in the battle . It was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops , though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent hill which later became known as Breed 's Hill . On June 13 , 1775 , the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city , which would give them control of Boston Harbor . In response , 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed 's Hill . During the night , the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed 's Hill , as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula . By daybreak of June 17 , the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula and mounted an attack against them that day . Two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties ; the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition . The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill , leaving the British in control of the Peninsula . The battle was a tactical , though somewhat Pyrrhic victory for the British , as it proved to be a sobering experience for them , involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred , including many officers . The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle .
