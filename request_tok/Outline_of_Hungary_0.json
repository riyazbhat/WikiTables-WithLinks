  "/wiki/Area": "Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina , in the plane . Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object . Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape , or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat . It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve ( a one-dimensional concept ) or the volume of a solid ( a three-dimensional concept ) . The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size . In the International System of Units ( SI ) , the standard unit of area is the square metre ( written as m2 ) , which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long . A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares . In mathematics , the unit square is defined to have area one , and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number . There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles , rectangles , and circles . Using these formulas , the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles . For shapes with curved boundary , calculus is usually required to compute the area . Indeed , the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus .",
  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area . The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area , and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas . In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race . Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations . Population , in a more simple term , is the number of people in a city or town , region , country or world ; population is usually determined by a process called census ( a process of collecting , analyzing , compiling and publishing data ) .",
