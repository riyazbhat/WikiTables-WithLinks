  "/wiki/Trauma_center": "A trauma center ( or trauma centre ) is a hospital equipped and staffed to provide care for patients suffering from major traumatic injuries such as falls , motor vehicle collisions , or gunshot wounds . A trauma center may also refer to an emergency department ( also known as a casualty department or accident and emergency ) without the presence of specialized services to care for victims of major trauma . In the United States , a hospital can receive trauma center status by meeting specific criteria established by the American College of Surgeons ( ACS ) and passing a site review by the Verification Review Committee . Official designation as a trauma center is determined by individual state law provisions . Trauma centers vary in their specific capabilities and are identified by Level designation : Level I ( Level-1 ) being the highest and Level III ( Level-3 ) being the lowest ( some states have five designated levels , in which case Level V ( Level-5 ) is the lowest ) . The highest levels of trauma centers have access to specialist medical and nursing care , including emergency medicine , trauma surgery , critical care , neurosurgery , orthopedic surgery , anesthesiology , and radiology , as well as a wide variety of highly specialized and sophisticated surgical and diagnostic equipment . Lower levels of trauma centers may only be able to provide initial care and stabilization of a traumatic injury and arrange for transfer of the victim to a higher level of trauma care . The operation of a trauma center is extremely expensive . Some areas , especially rural regions , are underserved by trauma centers because of that expense . As there is no way to schedule the need for emergency services , patient traffic at trauma centers can vary widely . A variety of methods have been developed for dealing with that . [ citation needed ] A trauma center will often have a helipad for receiving patients that have been airlifted to the hospital .",
