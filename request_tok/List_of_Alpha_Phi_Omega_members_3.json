  "/wiki/Governor": "A governor is , in most cases , a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government , ranking under the head of state . In federations , governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected . The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems , with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power , while others having a complete control over the entire government . Historically , the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area , such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company . These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces . There can also be non-political governors : high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management , styled governor ( s ) , who simply govern an institution , such as a corporation or a bank . For example , in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries , there are prison governors ( wardens in the United States ) , school governors and bank governors . The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial , from the Latin root gubernare . The historical female form is governess , though female officials are referred to by the gender-neutral form governor ( without the gender specific suffix ) of the noun to avoid confusion with other meanings of the term",

It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State .

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony",
