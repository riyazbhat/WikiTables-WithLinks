He is a pioneer in the electronic , ambient and new-age genres , and known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music , vast laser displays , large projections and fireworks . Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano . From an early age , he was introduced to a variety of art forms , including street performers , jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages . He played guitar in a band , but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer , a pioneer of musique concr\u00e8te at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales . His first mainstream success was the 1976 album Oxyg\u00e8ne . Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home , the album sold an estimated 12 million copies . Oxyg\u00e8ne was followed in 1978 by \u00c9quinoxe , and in 1979 , Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the Place de la Concorde , a record he has since broken three times . More albums were to follow , but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world . Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events , and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician . As of 2004 , Jarre had sold an estimated 80 million albums . He was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in the People 's Republic of China and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997 , which was attended by 3.5 million people .",

After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",

  "/wiki/Havana": "Havana ( /h\u0259\u02c8v\u00e6n\u0259/ ; Spanish : La Habana [ la a\u02c8\u03b2ana ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city , largest city , province , major port , and leading commercial center of Cuba . The city has a population of 2.1 million inhabitants , and it spans a total of 781.58 km2 ( 301.77 sq mi ) - making it the largest city by area , the most populous city , and the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region . The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas , becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain . The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city . The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana 's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War . The city is the center of the Cuban government , and home to various ministries , headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices . The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba ( PCC ) . In 2009 , the city/province had the third highest income in the country . Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one : Old Havana , Vedado and the newer suburban districts . The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay , which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors : Mari melena , Guanabacoa and Antares . The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north , entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay .",
  "/wiki/Paz_Sin_Fronteras": "Paz sin Fronteras ( Peace without Borders ) refers to a series of free outdoor concerts lead by the Colombian singer Juanes along with other internationally recognized artists .

It was organized by Juanes , who in turn was the show 's host . It took place March 16 , 2008 between 1:35 pm and 5:40 pm ( GMT ) on the Sim\u00f3n Bolivar International Bridge , on the Colombia-Venezuela border located between the city of C\u00facuta ( specifically the Metropolitan municipality of Villa de Rosario ) and the town of San Antonio del T\u00e1chira ( capital of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) . Paz sin Fronteras began as an initiative against the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis that held Ecuador , Colombia , and Venezuela , since Colombian forces invaded Ecuadorian territory in the Santa Rosa Bombardment of 2008 . This bombardment took place as a result of the failure of Raul Reyes , second in command of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces ( FARC ) .These border violations of the neighboring country generated a crisis that included the movement of Venezuelan and Ecuadorian troops to the borders . This crisis ended with the Rio Group meeting on Friday , March 7 , 2008 in the Dominican Republic . The artists that participated in the first concert were Alejandro Sanz , Juan Fernando Velasco , Carlos Vives , Juan Luis Guerra , Miguel Bos\u00e9 , and Ricardo Montaner , in addition to Juanes . None of the artists or the individuals in charge of the concert received any payment for their services , as the event was a free outdoor concert with the purpose of serving as a symbol of peace in the region .

  "/wiki/The_Beach_Boys": "The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne , California in 1961 . The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al Jardine . Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era . The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R & B to create their unique sound , and with Brian as composer , arranger , producer , and de facto leader , they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . The Beach Boys began as a garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry . In 1963 , the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , dubbed the California Sound . From 1965 , they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and Good Vibrations single raised the group 's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . After scrapping the album Smile in 1967 , Brian 's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues . The group 's commercial momentum faltered , and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound , they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archetypal pop music cop-outs . Carl took over as the band 's musical leader until the late 1970s , during which they rebounded with successful worldwide concert tours . Personal struggles , creative disagreements , and the overshadowing success of the band 's greatest hits albums precipitated their transition into an oldies act .",
