There are today two main groups ( of perhaps five original separate groups ) : the Wei Wai Kai ( Cape Mudge Band ) and Wei Wai Kum just across on the Vancouver Island mainland in the town of Campbell River . In addition to these two main groups there are the Kwiakah ( Kwiakah Band / Kwiakah First Nation ) originally from Phillips Arm and Frederick Arm and the Discovery Islands , the Tlaaluis ( Laa'luls ) between Bute and Loughborough Inlets - after a great war between the Kwakiutl and the Salish peoples they were so reduced in numbers that they joined the Kwiakah - and the Walitsima / Walitsum Band of Salmon River ( also called Hahamatses or Salmon River Band ) . So great was the power of the Southern Kwakiutl that the Comox people of the Courtenay-Comox came to speak Kwak'wala instead of K'omox , which today remains spoken by their kin the Sliammon and Homalhko on the other side of Georgia Strait around Powell River . Many of the Wewaykum in Campbell River are of Comox descent , while the Weewaikai of the Cape Mudge Band retain noble lineages and ceremonies going back centuries to their roots in the Queen Charlotte Strait . The great potlatches of the Cape Mudge chiefs are celebrated in the book Chiefly Feasts : The Enduring Kwakiutl Potlatch ( A. Donaitis , U. Wash Press ) . The Southern Kwakiutl remain politically separate from their distant kin , the Kwakwaka'wakw , whose name means speakers of Kwak'wala who remained in the Queen Charlotte Strait . The Kwagu ' \u0142 or Northern Kwakiutl of Fort Rupert are more closely allied and related to the Southern Kwakiutl than are the Kwakwaka'wakw . The term Kwakiutl has different political and historical associations with each of these groups , and has associations with one band in particular over all others , which is one reason why Kwakwaka'wakw evolved as the collective name for the main group of Queen Charlotte Strait Kwak'wala-speakers . The Southern Kwakiutl have always called themselves Laich-kwil-tach , at least since moving into the Georgia Strait . Laich-kwil-tach raids on the southern Georgia Strait , Puget Sound , and even up the Fraser River and out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca , and northwards , are described in the annals of the early non-First Nations explorers and traders .
