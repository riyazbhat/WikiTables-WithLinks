  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis",

Along its 356.5-mile-long ( 573.7 km ) route , US 31 follows the Michigan section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway as well as other freeways and divided highways northward to Ludington . North of there , the trunkline is a rural undivided highway through the Northern Michigan tourist destinations of Traverse City and Petoskey before terminating south of Mackinaw City . Along its route , US 31 has been dedicated in memory of a few different organizations , and sections of it carry the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) moniker . Four bridges used by the highway have been recognized for their historic character as well . The first highways along the route of the modern US 31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike , an auto trail from 1913 , and later a pair of state trunklines ( the original M-11 and M-58 ) in 1919 . These state highways were redesignated US 31 on November 11 , 1926 , when the US Highway System was approved . Since then , the highway has been realigned in places . The highway crossed the Straits of Mackinac by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the Mackinac Bridge was built , connecting to US 2 north of St. Ignace . Later , sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s . These segments opened through the subsequent decades with the last one opening in 2003",
