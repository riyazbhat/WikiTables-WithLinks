Heraclius 's reign was marked by several military campaigns . The year Heraclius came to power , the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers . Heraclius immediately took charge of the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628 . The first battles of the campaign ended in defeat for the Byzantines ; the Persian army fought their way to the Bosphorus but Constantinople was protected by impenetrable walls and a strong navy , and Heraclius was able to avoid total defeat . Soon after , he initiated reforms to rebuild and strengthen the military . Heraclius drove the Persians out of Asia Minor and pushed deep into their territory , defeating them decisively in 627 at the Battle of Nineveh . The Persian king Khosrow II was overthrown and executed by his son Kavad II , who soon sued for a peace treaty , agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory .

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire .

Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya , Turkey , to which the ancient city lends its name . Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator , one of Alexander the Great 's generals . The city 's geographical , military , and economic location benefited its occupants , particularly such features as the spice trade , the Silk Road , and the Royal Road . It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East . The city was the capital of the Seleucid Empire until 63 B.C . when the Romans took control , making it the seat of the governor of the province of Syria . From the early 4th century , the city was the seat of the Count of the Orient , head of the regional administration of sixteen provinces . [ citation needed ] It was also the main center of Hellenistic Judaism at the end of the Second Temple period . Antioch was one of the most important cities in the eastern Mediterranean of Rome 's dominions . It covered almost 1,100 acres ( 4.5 km2 ) within the walls of which one quarter was mountain , leaving 750 acres ( 3.0 km2 ) about one-fifth the area of Rome within the Aurelian Walls .

It claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire , along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond , its rulers briefly proclaiming themselves as Emperors in 1225/1227-1242 ( during which it is most often called the Empire of Thessalonica ) . The term Despotate of Epirus is , like Byzantine Empire itself , a modern historiographic convention and not a name in use at the time . The Despotate was centred on the region of Epirus , encompassing also Albania and the western portion of Greek Macedonia and also included Thessaly and western Greece as far south as Nafpaktos . Through a policy of aggressive expansion under Theodore Komnenos Doukas the Despotate of Epirus also briefly came to incorporate central Macedonia , with the establishment of the Empire of Thessalonica in 1224 , and Thrace as far east as Didymoteicho and Adrianopolis , and was on the verge of recapturing Constantinople and restoring the Byzantine Empire before the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230 where he was defeated by the Bulgarian Empire . After that , the Epirote state contracted to its core in Epirus and Thessaly , and was forced into vassalage to other regional powers . It nevertheless managed to retain its autonomy until conquered by the restored Palaiologan Byzantine Empire in ca . 1337 . In the 1410s , the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos Carlo I Tocco managed to reunite the core of the Epirote state , but his successors gradually lost it to the advancing Ottoman Empire , with the last stronghold , Vonitsa , falling to the Ottomans in 1479 .",
  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",

  "/wiki/Vandals": "The Vandals were an early Germanic people who first appeared in history inhabiting present-day southern Poland . Some later moved in large numbers , including most notably the group which successively established Vandal kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula , on western Mediterranean islands and in North Africa in the 5th century . The traditional view has been that the Vandals migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle from Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many Germanic tribes to migrate into the territory of the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next the Vandals were pushed westwards , crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest Iberia ) and Baetica ( south-central Iberia ) respectively . On the orders of the Romans the Visigoths invaded Iberia in 418 . They almost wiped out the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals who voluntarily subjected themselves to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric ( reigned 428-477 ) , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 .",
  "/wiki/Byzantine_Greeks": "The Byzantine Greeks were the Greek-speaking Christian Romans of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages . They were the main inhabitants of the lands of the Byzantine Empire ( Eastern Roman Empire ) , of Constantinople and Asia Minor ( modern Turkey ) , the Greek islands , Cyprus , and portions of the southern Balkans , and formed large minorities , or pluralities , in the coastal urban centres of the Levant and northern Egypt . Throughout their history , the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as Romans ( Greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 , romanized : Rh\u014dma\u00eeoi ) , but are referred to as Byzantine Greeks in modern historiography . The social structure of the Byzantine Greeks was primarily supported by a rural , agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry , and a small fraction of the poor . These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements : the chorion or village , the agridion or hamlet , and the proasteion or estate . Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base . Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis . As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century , more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries . Until the twelfth century , education within the Byzantine Greek population was more advanced than in the West , particularly at primary school level , resulting in comparatively high literacy rates . Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants , who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade . Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants , they held their own throughout the latter half of the Byzantine Empire 's existence . The clergy also held a special place , not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts , but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope .",

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",

The colony was established in the 6th century BC by settlers from Heraclea Pontica . The ancient city is located on the shore of the Black Sea at the outskirts of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula , where it is referred to as Khersones . The site is part of the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos . The name Chersonesos in Greek means peninsula and aptly describes the site on which the colony was established . It should not be confused with the Tauric Chersonese , a name often applied to the whole of the southern Crimea . During much of the classical period , Chersonesus was a democracy ruled by a group of elected Archons and a council called the Demiurgoi . As time passed , the government grew more oligarchic , with power concentrated in the hands of the archons . A form of oath sworn by all the citizens since the 3rd century BC has survived to the present day . In 2013 , Chersonesus was listed as a World Heritage Site .",

The throne went to two generals , Nikephoros Phokas ( r. 963-969 ) then John Tzimiskes ( r. 969-976 ) , before Basil became senior emperor . His influential great-uncle Basil Lekapenos was the de facto ruler of the Byzantine Empire until 985 . [ note 5 ] Basil II then held power for forty years . The early years of Basil 's reign were dominated by civil wars against two powerful generals from the Anatolian aristocracy ; first Bardas Skleros and later Bardas Phokas , which ended shortly after Phokas ' death and Skleros ' submission in 989 . Basil then oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire and the complete subjugation of the First Bulgarian Empire , its foremost European foe , after a prolonged struggle . Although the Byzantine Empire had made a truce with the Fatimid Caliphate in 987-988 , Basil led a campaign against the Caliphate that ended with another truce in 1000 . He also conducted a campaign against the Khazar Khaganate that gained the Byzantine Empire part of Crimea and a series of successful campaigns against the Kingdom of Georgia . Despite near-constant warfare , Basil distinguished himself as an administrator , reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire 's administration and military , filling its treasury , and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries . Although his successors were largely incapable rulers , the Empire flourished for decades after Basil 's death . One of the most important decisions taken during his reign was to offer the hand of his sister Anna Porphyrogenita to Vladimir I of Kiev in exchange for military support , thus forming the Byzantine military unit known as the Varangian Guard .",

The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

  "/wiki/Latin_Empire": "The Latin Empire , also referred to as the Latin Empire of Constantinople , was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire . The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east , with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors . The Fourth Crusade had originally been called to retake the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem but a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople , the capital of the Byzantine Empire . Originally , the plan had been to restore the deposed Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos , who had been usurped by Alexios III Angelos , to the throne . The crusaders had been promised financial and military aid by Isaac 's son Alexios , with which they had planned to continue to Jerusalem . When the crusaders reached Constantinople the situation quickly turned volatile and while Isaac and Alexios briefly ruled , the crusaders did not receive the payment they had hoped for . In April 1204 , they captured and plundered the city 's enormous wealth . The crusaders selected their own emperor from among their own ranks , Baldwin of Flanders , and divided the territory of the Byzantine Empire into various new vassal crusader states . The Latin Empire 's authority was immediately challenged by Byzantine rump states led by the Laskaris family ( connected to the Angelos dynasty of 1185-1204 ) in Nicaea and the Komnenos family ( which had ruled as Byzantine Emperors 1081-1185 ) in Trebizond . From 1224 to 1242 the Komnenos Doukas family , also connected to the Angeloi , challenged Latin authority from Thessalonica . The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade , especially Venice , and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline due to constant war with Bulgaria to the north and the various Byzantine claimants . The Nicaean Empire eventually recovered Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire under Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 .",

The previous war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrow II regain his throne . In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas . Khosrow proceeded to declare war , ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice . This became a decades-long conflict , the longest war in the series , and was fought throughout the Middle East : in Egypt , the Levant , Mesopotamia , the Caucasus , Anatolia , Armenia , the Aegean Sea and before the walls of Constantinople itself . While the Persians proved largely successful during the first stage of the war from 602 to 622 , conquering much of the Levant , Egypt , several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia , the ascendancy of emperor Heraclius in 610 led , despite initial setbacks , to a status quo ante bellum . Heraclius ' campaigns in Iranian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive , allowing his forces to regain momentum . Allied with the Avars and Slavs , the Persians made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626 , but were defeated there . In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of Persia . A civil war broke out in Persia , during which the Persians killed their king , and sued for peace . By the end of the conflict , both sides had exhausted their human and material resources and achieved very little . Consequently , they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate , whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war .",

  "/wiki/Iznik": "\u0130znik is a town and an administrative district in the Province of Bursa , Turkey . It was historically known as Nicaea ( Greek : \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 , N\u00edkaia ) , from which its modern name also derives . The town lies in a fertile basin at the eastern end of Lake \u0130znik , bounded by ranges of hills to the north and south . As the crow flies , the town is only 90 kilometres ( 56 miles ) southeast of Istanbul but by road it is 200 km ( 124 miles ) around the Gulf of \u0130zmit . It is 80 km ( 50 miles ) by road from Bursa . The town is situated with its west wall rising from the lake itself , providing both protection from siege from that direction , as well as a source of supplies which would be difficult to cut off . The lake is large enough that it can not be blockaded from the land easily , and the city was large enough to make any attempt to reach the harbour from shore-based siege weapons very difficult . The city was surrounded on all sides by 5 km ( 3 mi ) of walls about 10 m ( 33 ft ) high . These were in turn surrounded by a double ditch on the land portions , and also included over 100 towers in various locations . Large gates on the three landbound sides of the walls provided the only entrance to the city . Today the walls are pierced in many places for roads , but much of the early work survives and as a result it is a tourist destination . The town has a population of about 15,000 .",
