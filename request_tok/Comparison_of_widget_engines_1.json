  "/wiki/Integrated_development_environment": "An integrated development environment ( IDE ) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development . An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor , build automation tools and a debugger . Some IDEs , such as NetBeans and Eclipse , contain the necessary compiler , interpreter , or both ; others , such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus , do not . The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined ; sometimes a version control system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface ( GUI ) are integrated . Many modern IDEs also have a class browser , an object browser , and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented software development .",

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications . Media types were originally defined in Request for Comments 2045 in November 1996 as a part of MIME ( Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ) specification , for denoting type of email message content and attachments ; hence the original name , MIME type . Media types are also used by other internet protocols such as HTTP and document file formats such as HTML , for similar purpose .",
  "/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime": "Adobe AIR ( also known as Adobe Integrated Runtime ) is a cross-platform runtime system developed by Adobe Systems for building desktop applications and mobile applications , programmed using Adobe Animate , ActionScript and optionally Apache Flex . The runtime supports installable applications on Windows , OS X and mobile operating systems including Android , iOS and BlackBerry Tablet OS . It also originally ran on Linux , but support was discontinued as of version 2.6 in 2011 . Adobe AIR is a runtime environment that allows Adobe Animate content and ActionScript 3.0 coders to construct applications and video games that run as a stand-alone app and behave similar to a native application on supported platforms . A Flash Player or HTML5 application used in a browser does not require installation , while AIR applications require installation from an installer file ( Windows and OS X ) or the appropriate App Store ( iOS and Android ) . AIR applications have unrestricted access to local storage and file systems , while browser-based applications only have access to individual files selected by users . Adobe AIR internally uses a shared codebase with the Flash Player rendering engine and ActionScript 3.0 as the primary programming language . Applications must specifically be built for Adobe AIR to use additional features provided , such as multi-touch , file system integration , native client extensions , integration with Taskbar or Dock , and access to accelerometer and GPS devices . HTML5 applications may run on the WebKit engine included in AIR . Notable applications built with Adobe AIR include eBay Desktop , Pandora One desktop , TweetDeck , the former Adobe Media Player , Angry Birds , and Machinarium , among other multimedia and task management applications . According to Adobe , over 100,000 unique applications have been built on AIR , and over 1 billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world , as of May 2014 . Adobe AIR was voted as the Best Mobile Application Development product at the Consumer Electronics Show for two consecutive years ( CES 2014 and CES 2015 ) .",
  "/wiki/Adobe_Flex": "Apache Flex , formerly Adobe Flex , is a software development kit ( SDK ) for the development and deployment of cross-platform rich Internet applications based on the Adobe Flash platform . Initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe Systems , Adobe donated Flex to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011 and it was promoted to a top-level project in December 2012 . The Flex 3 SDK was released under the open source Mozilla Public License in 2008 . Consequently , Flex applications can be developed using standard Integrated development environments ( IDEs ) , such as IntelliJ IDEA , Eclipse , the free and open source IDE FlashDevelop , as well as the proprietary Adobe Flash Builder . The latest version of the SDK is version 4.16.1 . It is released under version 2 of the Apache License . In 2014 , the Apache Software Foundation started a new project called FlexJS to cross-compile ActionScript 3 to JavaScript to enable it to run on browsers that do not support Adobe Flash Player and on devices that do not support the Adobe AIR runtime . In 2017 , FlexJS was renamed to Apache Royale . The Apache Software Foundation describes the current iteration of Apache Royale as an open-source frontend technology that allows a developer to code in ActionScript 3 and MXML and target web , mobile devices and desktop devices on Apache Cordova all at once . Apache Royale is currently in beta development stage .",

Artists may produce Flash graphics and animations using Adobe Animate . Software developers may produce applications and video games using Adobe Flash Builder , FlashDevelop , Flash Catalyst , or any text editor when used with the Apache Flex SDK . End-users can view Flash content via Flash Player ( for web browsers ) , AIR ( for desktop or mobile apps ) or third-party players such as Scaleform ( for video games ) . Adobe Flash Player ( supported on Microsoft Windows , macOS and Linux ) enables end-users to view Flash content using web browsers . Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones , but has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR . The ActionScript programming language allows the development of interactive animations , video games , web applications , desktop applications and mobile applications . Programmers can implement Flash software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate , Adobe Flash Builder , Adobe Director , FlashDevelop and Powerflasher FDT . Adobe AIR enables full-featured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with Flash and published for Windows , macOS , Android , iOS , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Wii U , and Nintendo Switch .",

New widgets can be opened , via an icon bar on the bottom of the layer , loading a list of available apps similar to the iOS homescreen or the macOS Launchpad . After loading , the widget is ready for use . Dashboard was first introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger . It can be activated as an application , from the Dock , Launchpad or Spotlight . It can also be accessed by a dashboard key . Alternatively , the user can choose to make Dashboard open on moving the cursor into a preassigned hot corner or keyboard shortcut .
