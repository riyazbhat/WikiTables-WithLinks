  "/wiki/Pinochet_dictatorship": "The military dictatorship of Chile ( Spanish : dictadura militar de Chile ) was an authoritarian military regime that ruled Chile for seventeen years , between September 11 , 1973 and March 11 , 1990 . The dictatorship was established after the democratically-elected socialist government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat on 11 September 1973 . During this time , the country was ruled by a military junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet . The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende 's presidency to justify its seizure of power . The dictatorship presented its mission as a national reconstruction . The coup was the result of multiple forces , including pressure from conservative and womens groups , certain political parties , union strikes and other domestic unrest , as well as international factors . According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative Jack Devine , although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup , subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government . The regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the history of Chile . Overall , the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing , tortured tens of thousands of prisoners , and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile . The dictatorship 's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt . Two years after its ascension radical neoliberal economic reforms were implemented , in sharp contrast to Allende 's leftist policies , advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the Chicago Boys .

The program , nominally intended to eradicate communist or Soviet influence and ideas , was created to suppress active or potential opposition movements against the participating governments ' neoliberal economic policies , which sought to reverse the economic policies of the previous era . Due to its clandestine nature , the precise number of deaths directly attributable to Operation Condor is highly disputed . Some estimates are that at least 60,000 deaths can be attributed to Condor , roughly 30,000 of these in Argentina , and the so-called Archives of Terror list 50,000 killed , 30,000 disappeared and 400,000 imprisoned . American political scientist J. Patrice McSherry gives a figure of at least 402 killed in operations which crossed national borders in a 2002 source , and mentions in a 2009 source that of those who had gone into exile and were kidnapped , tortured and killed in allied countries or illegally transferred to their home countries to be executed ... hundreds , or thousands , of such persons - the number still has not been finally determined - were abducted , tortured , and murdered in Condor operations . Victims included dissidents and leftists , union and peasant leaders , priests and nuns , students and teachers , intellectuals and suspected guerrillas . Although it was described by the CIA as a cooperative effort by the intelligence/security services of several South American countries to combat terrorism and subversion , guerrillas were used as an excuse , as they were never substantial enough to control territory , gain material support by any foreign power , or otherwise threaten national security . Condor 's key members were the governments in Argentina , Chile , Uruguay , Paraguay , Bolivia and Brazil . Ecuador and Peru later joined the operation in more peripheral roles .
