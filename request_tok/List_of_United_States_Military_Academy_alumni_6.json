  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts",
  "/wiki/Mexican\u2013American_War": "The Mexican-American War , [ a ] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervenci\u00f3n Estadounidense en M\u00e9xico ( American intervention in Mexico ) , [ b ] was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 . It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery",

  "/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg": "The siege of Vicksburg ( May 18 - July 4 , 1863 ) was the final major military action in the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War . In a series of maneuvers , Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Tennessee crossed the Mississippi River and drove the Confederate Army of Mississippi , led by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton , into the defensive lines surrounding the fortress city of Vicksburg , Mississippi . Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River ; therefore , capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy , the Anaconda Plan . When two major assaults against the Confederate fortifications , on May 19 and 22 , were repulsed with heavy casualties , Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25 . After holding out for more than forty days , with their supplies nearly gone , the garrison surrendered on July 4 . The successful ending of the Vicksburg campaign significantly degraded the ability of the Confederacy to maintain its war effort . This action , combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9 , yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces , who would hold it for the rest of the conflict . The Confederate surrender on July 4 , 1863 , is sometimes considered , when combined with Gen. Robert E. Lee 's defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen. George Meade the previous day , the turning point of the war . It cut off the Trans-Mississippi Department ( containing the states of Arkansas , Texas and part of Louisiana ) from the rest of the Confederate States , effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war",

He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law 's real estate in Chicago , Illinois . He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed adjutant general by Governor Beriah Magoffin in 1861 . In this position , he tried to enforce Kentucky 's neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War . When the state 's neutrality was breached , Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the Union Army . In 1862 , he accepted Ulysses S. Grant 's demand for an unconditional surrender at the Battle of Fort Donelson . He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war . He spent five months as a prisoner of war .

The Union capture of the Confederate fort near the Tennessee-Kentucky border opened the Cumberland River , an important avenue for the invasion of the South . The Union 's success also elevated Brig . Gen. Ulysses S. Grant from an obscure and largely unproven leader to the rank of major general , and earned him the nickname of Unconditional Surrender Grant . Grant moved his army 12 miles ( 19 km ) overland to Fort Donelson from February 11 to 13 and conducted several small probing attacks . ( Although the name was not yet in use , the troops serving under Grant were the nucleus of the Union 's Army of the Tennessee . ) On February 14 , Union gunboats under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote attempted to reduce the fort with gunfire , but were forced to withdraw after sustaining heavy damage from Fort Donelson 's water batteries . On February 15 , with the fort surrounded , the Confederates , commanded by Brig . Gen. John B.

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Perryville": "The Battle of Perryville ( also known as the Battle of Chaplin Hills ) was fought on October 8 , 1862 , in the Chaplin Hills west of Perryville , Kentucky , as the culmination of the Confederate Heartland Offensive ( Kentucky Campaign ) during the American Civil War . Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg 's Army of Mississippi [ b ] initially won a tactical victory against primarily a single corps of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell 's Union Army of the Ohio . The battle is considered a strategic Union victory , sometimes called the Battle for Kentucky , since Bragg withdrew to Tennessee soon thereafter . The Union retained control of the critical border state of Kentucky for the remainder of the war . On October 7 , Buell 's army , in pursuit of Bragg , converged on the small crossroads town of Perryville in three columns . Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general , on Peters Hill , when the Confederate infantry arrived . Both sides were desperate to get access to fresh water . The next day , at dawn , fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike , halting just before the Confederate line . After noon , a Confederate division struck the Union left flank - the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook - and forced it to fall back . When more Confederate divisions joined the fray , the Union line made a stubborn stand , counterattacked , but finally fell back with some units routed . Buell , several miles behind the action , was unaware that a major battle was taking place and did not send any reserves to the front until late in the afternoon . The Union troops on the left flank , reinforced by two brigades , stabilized their line , and the Confederate attack sputtered to a halt",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga": "The Battle of Chickamauga , fought on September 18 - 20 , 1863 , between U.S. and Confederate forces in the American Civil War , marked the end of a Union offensive , the Chickamauga Campaign , in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia . It was the first major battle of the war fought in Georgia , the most significant Union defeat in the Western Theater , and involved the second-highest number of casualties after the Battle of Gettysburg . The battle was fought between the Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg , and was named for Chickamauga Creek , which meanders near the battle area in northwest Georgia ( and ultimately flows into the Tennessee River about 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) northeast of downtown Chattanooga ) . After his successful Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive , aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga . In early September , Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg 's army out of Chattanooga , heading south . The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at Davis 's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans 's army , to defeat it , and then to move back into the city . On September 17 he headed north , intending to attack the isolated XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18 , his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry , which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles .

Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons , veto legislation , and call the legislature into session . The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state 's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state . The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch , limited somewhat by the adoption of a merit system for state employees in 1960 .

The fighting began on October 3 as the Confederates pushed the U.S. Army from the rifle pits originally constructed by the Confederates for the siege of Corinth . The Confederates exploited a gap in the Union line and continued to press the Union troops until they fell back to an inner line of fortifications . On the second day of battle , the Confederates moved forward to meet heavy Union artillery fire , storming Battery Powell and Battery Robinett , where desperate hand-to-hand fighting occurred .

These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century . The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors , including cultural clashes , land disputes , and criminal acts committed by both sides . The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other 's colonial settlements . After the American Revolution , many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use ; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal . In Canada , 11 Numbered Treaties covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts . As settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780 , armed conflicts increased in size , duration , and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes . The climax came in the War of 1812 , when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost . Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty , often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier , especially Oklahoma . The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West , as American settlers kept expanding their territories , to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations",
  "/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run": "The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was the first major battle of the American Civil War and was a Confederate victory .

The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy . Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T.

Part of the Maryland Campaign , it was the first field army-level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It was the bloodiest day in United States military history , with a combined tally of 22,717 dead , wounded , or missing . After pursuing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan of the Union Army launched attacks against Lee 's army , in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek . At dawn on September 17 , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee 's left flank . Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller 's Cornfield , and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church . Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center , but the Federal advantage was not followed up . In the afternoon , Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside 's corps entered the action , capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right . At a crucial moment , Confederate Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill 's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack , driving back Burnside and ending the battle . Although outnumbered two-to-one , Lee committed his entire force , while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army , enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill .

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

On September 16 , Laws took Sheridan 's letter ( hidden in his mouth ) to Wright , who consulted her mother and then replied ( in a note which Laws also hid in his mouth ) that a Confederate officer recovering from his wounds had recently bragged about Confederate artillery and infantry battalions under General Joseph B. Kershaw and Lt. Col. Wilfred E. Cutshaw having left Winchester to raid the B & O Railroad at Martinsburg , in the new state of West Virginia . Accordingly , Sheridan advanced toward Winchester along the Berryville Pike with the VI Corps and XIX Corps , crossing Opequon Creek . The Union advance was delayed long enough for Early to concentrate his forces to meet the main assault , which continued for several hours . Casualties were very heavy .

Grant ) had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River , where the Confederate Army of Mississippi ( General Albert Sidney Johnston , P. G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio . The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting , and Grant 's men instead fell back to the northeast , in the direction of Pittsburg Landing . A Union position on a slightly sunken road , nicknamed the Hornet 's Nest and defended by the divisions of Brig . Gens . Benjamin Prentiss and William H. L. Wallace , provided time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries . Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed , while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Girardeau": "The Battle of Cape Girardeau was a military demonstration of the American Civil War , occurring on April 26 , 1863 in Cape Girardeau , Missouri . The conflict was part of the pursuit of US Brigadier General John McNeil through Southeast Missouri by Confederate Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke . Though the conflict to this day is known as a battle , it was a relatively small engagement whose primary importance was as the turning point that brought General Marmaduke 's second Missouri raid to an end",
  "/wiki/Red_River_Campaign": "The Red River Campaign or Red River Expedition comprised a series of battles fought along the Red River in Louisiana during the American Civil War from March 10 to May 22 , 1864 . The campaign was a Union initiative , fought between approximately 30,000 Union troops under the command of Major General Nathaniel P. Banks , and Confederate troops under the command of Lieutenant General Richard Taylor , whose strength varied from 6,000 to 15,000 . The campaign was primarily the plan of Union General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck , and a diversion from Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant 's plan to surround the main Confederate armies by using Banks 's Army of the Gulf to capture Mobile , Alabama . It was a Union failure , characterized by poor planning and mismanagement , in which not a single objective was fully accomplished . Taylor successfully defended the Red River Valley with a smaller force . However , the decision of Taylor 's immediate superior , General Edmund Kirby Smith , to send half of Taylor 's force north to Arkansas rather than south in pursuit of the retreating Banks after the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill , led to bitter enmity between Taylor and Smith",

  "/wiki/Duel": "A duel is an arranged engagement in combat between two people , with matched weapons , in accordance with agreed-upon rules . Duels in this form were chiefly practiced in early modern Europe with precedents in the medieval code of chivalry , and continued into the modern period ( 18th to late 19th centuries , if not beyond ) especially among military officers . During the 17th and 18th centuries ( and earlier ) , duels were mostly fought with swords ( the rapier , and later the small sword ) , but beginning in the late 18th century in England , duels were more commonly fought using pistols . Fencing and pistol duels continued to co-exist throughout the 19th century . The duel was based on a code of honor . Duels were fought not so much to kill the opponent as to gain satisfaction , that is , to restore one 's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one 's life for it , and as such the tradition of dueling was originally reserved for the male members of nobility ; however , in the modern era it extended to those of the upper classes generally . On occasion , duels with pistols or swords were fought between women . Legislation against dueling goes back to the medieval period . The Fourth Council of the Lateran ( 1215 ) outlawed duels , and civil legislation in the Holy Roman Empire against dueling was passed in the wake of the Thirty Years ' War . From the early 17th century , duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced . Dueling largely fell out of favor in England by the mid-19th century and in Continental Europe by the turn of the 20th century . Dueling declined in the Eastern United States in the 19th century and by the time the American Civil War broke out , dueling had begun to wane even in the South",

  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Cold_Harbor": "The Battle of Cold Harbor was fought during the American Civil War near Mechanicsville , Virginia , from May 31 to June 12 , 1864 , with the most significant fighting occurring on June 3 . It was one of the final battles of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's Overland Campaign , and is remembered as one of American history 's bloodiest , most lopsided battles . Thousands of Union soldiers were killed or wounded in a hopeless frontal assault against the fortified positions of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army . On May 31 , as Grant 's army once again swung around the right flank of Lee 's army , Union cavalry seized the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor , about 10 miles northeast of the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , holding it against Confederate attacks until the Union infantry arrived . Both Grant and Lee , whose armies had suffered enormous casualties in the Overland Campaign , received reinforcements . On the evening of June 1 , the Union VI Corps and XVIII Corps arrived and assaulted the Confederate works to the west of the crossroads with some success . On June 2 , the remainder of both armies arrived and the Confederates built an elaborate series of fortifications 7 miles long . At dawn on June 3 , three Union corps attacked the Confederate works on the southern end of the line and were easily repulsed with heavy casualties . Attempts to assault the northern end of the line and to resume the assaults on the southern were unsuccessful . Grant said of the battle in his Personal Memoirs , I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made . .

An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements .

  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait . Colombia , France , and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan",
