  "/wiki/Monster_Manual": "The Monster Manual ( MM ) is the primary bestiary sourcebook for monsters in the Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) fantasy role-playing game , first published in 1977 by TSR . It includes monsters derived from mythology and folklore , as well as creatures created specifically for D & D . It describes each with game-specific statistics ( such as the monster 's level or number of hit dice ) , and a brief description of its habits and habitats . Most of the entries also have an image of the creature . Along with the Player 's Handbook and Dungeon Master 's Guide , it is one of the three core rulebooks in most editions of the D & D game . Several editions of the Monster Manual have been released for each edition of D & D . It was the first hardcover book of the D & D series . Due to the level of detail and illustration included , it was cited as a pivotal example of a new style of wargame books . Future editions would draw on various sources and act as a compendium of published monsters .",
  "/wiki/Gary_Gygax": "Ernest Gary Gygax ( /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a\u0261\u00e6ks/ GY-gaks ; July 27 , 1938 - March 4 , 2008 ) was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) with Dave Arneson . In the 1960s , Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the Gen Con gaming convention . In 1971 , he helped develop Chainmail , a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare . He co-founded the company Tactical Studies Rules ( TSR , Inc. ) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973 . The following year , he and Arneson created D & D , which expanded on Gygax 's Chainmail and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child . In the same year , he founded The Dragon , a magazine based around the new game . In 1977 , Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game , called Advanced Dungeons & Dragons . Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system , as well as several pre-packaged adventures called modules that gave a person running a D & D game ( the Dungeon Master ) a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario . In 1983 , he worked to license the D & D product line into the successful D & D cartoon series . After leaving TSR in 1986 over issues with its new majority owner , Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently , beginning with the multi-genre Dangerous Journeys in 1992 . He designed another gaming system called Lejendary Adventure , released in 1999 . In 2005 , Gygax was involved in the Castles & Crusades role-playing game , which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of D & D and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax .",

The book consisted mostly of material previously published in magazines , and included new races , classes , and other material to expand the rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook . The book was notorious for its considerable number of errors , and was received negatively by the gaming press whose criticisms targeted the over-powered races and classes , among other issues . Gygax intended to use the book 's content for a planned second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ; however , much of the book 's content was not reused in the second edition , which went into development shortly after Gygax 's departure from TSR . A second book titled Unearthed Arcana was produced by Wizards of the Coast for Dungeons & Dragons third edition in 2004 . The designers did not reproduce material from the original book , but instead attempted to emulate its purpose by providing variant rules and options to change the game itself .
