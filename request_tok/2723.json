  "/wiki/George_Grenville": "George Grenville ( 14 October 1712 - 13 November 1770 ) was a British Whig statesman who rose to the position of Prime Minister of Great Britain . Grenville was born into an influential political family and first entered Parliament in 1741 as an MP for Buckingham .

In October 1761 he chose to stay in government and accepted the new role of Leader of the Commons causing a rift with his brother-in-law and political ally William Pitt who had resigned . Grenville was subsequently made Northern Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute . On 8 April 1763 , Lord Bute resigned , and Grenville assumed his position as Prime Minister . His government tried to bring public spending under control and pursued an assertive foreign policy . His best-known policy is the Stamp Act , a long-standing tax in Great Britain which Grenville extended to the colonies in America , but which instigated widespread opposition in Britain 's American colonies and was later repealed . Grenville had increasingly strained relations with his colleagues and the King and in 1765 he was dismissed by George III and replaced by Lord Rockingham . For the last five years of his life , Grenville led a group of his supporters in opposition and staged a public reconciliation with Pitt .",

  "/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham": "William Pitt , 1st Earl of Chatham , PC , FRS ( 15 November 1708 - 11 May 1778 ) was a British statesman of the Whig group who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain in the middle of the 18th century . Historians call him Pitt of Chatham , or William Pitt the Elder , to distinguish him from his son , William Pitt the Younger , who also was a prime minister . Pitt was also known as The Great Commoner , because of his long-standing refusal to accept a title until 1766 . Pitt was a member of the British cabinet and its informal leader from 1756 to 1761 ( with a brief interlude in 1757 ) , during the Seven Years ' War ( known as the French and Indian War in the United States ) . He again led the ministry , holding the official title of Lord Privy Seal , between 1766 and 1768 . Much of his power came from his brilliant oratory . He was out of power for most of his career and became well known for his attacks on the government , such as those on Walpole 's corruption in the 1730s , Hanoverian subsidies in the 1740s , peace with France in the 1760s , and the uncompromising policy towards the American colonies in the 1770s . Pitt is best known as the wartime political leader of Britain in the Seven Years ' War , especially for his single-minded devotion to victory over France , a victory which ultimately solidified Britain 's dominance over world affairs . He is also known for his popular appeal , his opposition to corruption in government , his support for the colonial position in the run-up to the American War of Independence , his advocacy of British greatness , expansionism and colonialism , and his antagonism toward Britain 's chief enemies and rivals for colonial power , Spain and France . Marie Peters argues his statesmanship was based on a clear , consistent , and distinct appreciation of the value of the Empire . The British parliamentary historian P. D. G. Thomas argues that Pitt 's power was based not on his family connections but on the extraordinary parliamentary skills by which he dominated the House of Commons . He displayed a commanding manner , brilliant rhetoric , and sharp debating skills that cleverly utilised broad literary and historical knowledge .",

He led Great Britain through most of the American War of Independence . He also held a number of other cabinet posts , including Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer . North 's reputation among historians has swung back and forth . It reached its lowest point in the late nineteenth century , when he was depicted as a creature of the king and an incompetent who lost the American colonies . In the early twentieth century , a revisionism emphasised his strengths in administering the Treasury , handling the House of Commons , and in defending the Church of England . Whig historian Herbert Butterfield , however , argued that his indolence was a barrier to efficient crisis management ; he neglected his role in supervising the entire war effort .",

A member of the Conservative Party , he was the last prime minister to serve his term while a member of the House of Lords ( Alec Douglas-Home was very briefly a member of the House of Lords at the start of his premiership , but he renounced his peerage and subsequently sat in the House of Commons ) . Lord Robert Cecil was first elected to the House of Commons in 1854 and served as Secretary of State for India in Lord Derby 's Conservative government from 1866 until his resignation in 1867 over its introduction of Benjamin Disraeli 's Reform Bill that extended the suffrage to working-class men .

He remained as Prime Minister until Gladstone 's Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish Nationalists , despite the Unionists gaining the largest number of votes and seats at the 1892 general election .

Achieving rapid promotion as a young Member of Parliament , he became Foreign Secretary aged 38 , before resigning in protest at Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement policy towards Mussolini 's Italy . He again held that position for most of the Second World War , and a third time in the early 1950s . Having been deputy to Winston Churchill for almost 15 years , he succeeded him as the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister in April 1955 , and a month later won a general election . Eden 's worldwide reputation as an opponent of appeasement , a man of peace , and a skilled diplomat was overshadowed in 1956 when the United States refused to support the Anglo-French military response to the Suez Crisis , which critics across party lines regarded as an historic setback for British foreign policy , signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East . Most historians argue that he made a series of blunders , especially not realising the depth of American opposition to military action . Two months after ordering an end to the Suez operation , he resigned as prime minister on grounds of ill health and because he was widely suspected of having misled the House of Commons over the degree of collusion with France and Israel . Eden is generally ranked among the least successful British prime ministers of the 20th century , although two broadly sympathetic biographies ( in 1986 and 2003 ) have gone some way to shifting the balance of opinion . Biographer D. R. Thorpe described the Suez Crisis as a truly tragic end to his premiership , and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career .",

He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament at the 1924 general election for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement . Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . When Eden resigned in 1957 following the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party . As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high - if uneven - growth . In his Bedford speech of July 1957 he told the nation they had 'never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s ."
