The opposing team attempts to stop the attacking side scoring points by tackling the player carrying the ball . In addition to tries , points can be scored by kicking goals .

Kicks at goal may also be awarded for penalties . The Super League and the National Rugby League ( NRL ) are the premier club competitions .

  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century .

The Cricket World Cup , generally held every four years , is played in this format . One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals ( LOI ) , although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches . They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A , limited overs competition . The international one day game is a late-twentieth-century development . The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and , instead , play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side . Australia won the game by 5 wickets . ODIs were played in white coloured kits with a red coloured ball . In the late 1970s , Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition , and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace , including coloured uniforms , matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens , and , for television broadcasts , multiple camera angles , effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch , and on-screen graphics . The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink , played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979 . This led not only to Packer 's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play , and becoming international professionals , no longer needing jobs outside cricket ."
