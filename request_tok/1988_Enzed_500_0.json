  "/wiki/Nissan_Skyline_HR31_GTS-R": "The Nissan Skyline ( Japanese : \u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 Nissan Sukairain ) is an automobile nameplate originally produced by the Prince Motor Company starting in 1957 , and then by Nissan after the two companies merged in 1967 . After the merger , the Skyline and its larger counterpart , the Nissan Gloria , were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop . The Skyline was largely designed and engineered by Shinichiro Sakurai from inception , and he remained a chief influence of the car until his death in 2011 . Skylines are available in either coupe , or sedan body styles , plus station wagon , crossover , convertible and pickup/sedan delivery body styles . The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights ( as of 1972 ) . While not distributed in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G , the Skyline 's prominence in video games , movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there from 1989 to late 2005 . The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive , with four-wheel drive being available since the eighth-generation 's debut . The eleventh-generation Skyline ( V35 ) was another major turning point for the nameplate , as it dropped some of the previous generation Skyline 's trademark characteristics such as the straight-six engine ( replaced with a V6 ) and turbocharging , and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line . Nissan decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market , while its platform-mate , the 350Z , revived the Z line of pure sports cars . The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America , being sold under Nissan 's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35 in 2002 . The Skyline ( V36/J50 ) is sold in Europe , North America , South Korea , Taiwan , and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 . On April 12 , 2010 a Guinness Book of Records event took place with 225 Skylines taking part in a parade lap at the ISTS at Silverstone UK , which produced two world records : the most recorded Nissan Skylines at one meet at one time , and Most Nissan Skylines on a track at the same time",
