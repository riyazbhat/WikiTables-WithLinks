[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund": "The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund ( collectively , the Social Security Trust Fund or Trust Funds ) are trust funds that provide for payment of Social Security ( Old-Age , Survivors , and Disability Insurance ; OASDI ) benefits administered by the United States Social Security Administration . The Social Security Administration collects payroll taxes and uses the money collected to pay Old-Age , Survivors , and Disability Insurance benefits by way of trust funds . When the program runs a surplus , the excess funds increase the value of the Trust Fund . At the end of 2014 , the Trust Fund contained ( or alternatively , was owed ) $ 2.79 trillion , up $ 25 billion from 2013 . The Trust Fund is required by law to be invested in non-marketable securities issued and guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government . These securities earn a market rate of interest . Excess funds are used by the government for non-Social Security purposes , creating the obligations to the Social Security Administration and thus program recipients . However , Congress could cut these obligations by altering the law . Trust Fund obligations are considered intra-governmental debt , a component of the public or national debt . As of June 2015 , the intragovernmental debt was $ 5.1 trillion of the $ 18.2 trillion national debt . According to the Social Security Trustees , who oversee the program and report on its financial condition , program costs are expected to exceed non-interest income from 2010 onward . However , due to interest ( earned at a 3.6% rate in 2014 ) the program will run an overall surplus that adds to the fund through the end of 2019 .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia": "Superannuation in Australia are the arrangements put in place by the Government of Australia to encourage people in Australia to accumulate funds to provide them with an income stream when they retire . Superannuation in Australia is partly compulsory , and is further encouraged by tax benefits . The government has set minimum standards for contributions by employees as well as for the management of superannuation funds . It is compulsory for employers to make superannuation contributions for their employees on top of the employees ' wages and salaries . The employer contribution rate has been 9.5% since 1 July 2014 , and as of 2015 [ update ] , was planned to increase gradually from 2021 to 12% in 2025 . People are also encouraged to supplement compulsory superannuation contributions with voluntary contributions , including diverting their wages or salary income into superannuation contributions under so-called salary sacrifice arrangements . An avoidable issue with Australias superannuation system is employees failing to consolidate multiple accounts , thus being charged multiple account fees . Of Australias 15 million superannuation fund members , 40% have multiple accounts , which collectively costs them $ 2.6 billion in additional fees each year . The federal budget estimates put the number of unnecessary duplicate accounts at 10 million . Plans are in place to facilitate consolidation of these accounts . An individual can withdraw funds out of a superannuation fund when the person meets one of the conditions of release , such as retirement , terminal medical condition , or permanent incapacity , contained in Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Industry ( Supervision ) Regulations 1994 . As of July 1 , 2018 , members have also been able to withdraw voluntary contributions made as part of the First Home Super Saver Scheme ( FHSS ) .",

  "/wiki/Civil_Service_Retirement_System": "The Civil Service Retirement System ( CSRS ) was organized in 1920 and has provided retirement , disability , and survivor benefits for most civilian employees in the United States federal government . Upon the creation of a new Federal Employees Retirement System ( FERS ) in 1987 , those newly hired after that date can not participate in CSRS . CSRS continues to provide retirement benefits to those eligible to receive them . CSRS is a defined-benefit plan , akin to a pension . Notably , though , CSRS employees do not participate in Social Security ( unless having worked in the private sector beforehand , and then subject to penalties ) . Employees hired after 1983 are required to be covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System ( FERS ) , which is a three tiered retirement system with a smaller defined benefit ( pension ) , Social Security , and a 401 ( k ) -style system called the Thrift Savings Plan ( TSP ) . The defined benefits of both the CSRS and the FERS systems are paid out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund , which had a projected balance of $ 898 billion as of September 30 , 2017 . With changes in the determining retirement coverage of federal employees under FERS or CSRS , those employees who are later rehired that were previously covered under CSRS will retain their CSRS coverage if they meet certain service rules . In general , if rehired employees have 5 years of civilian service as of December 31 , 1986 , they will retain CSRS coverage .

In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
