In April 1921 , he visited Korea and played an important role in rescuing the threatened music tradition of the Joseon court . Though the Japanese government had dissolved Korea 's Royal Music Institute , forcing it to rely on private sponsorship , he successfully argued that traditional music and dance like aak will be lost forever if it is not supported by the Japanese government . He took film and audio recordings , and published a widely circulated report extolling Korea 's court music and comparing it to Japanese court practice .

The prize has been referred to as prestigious and coveted , with The Washington Post calling it the most prestigious award in religion .

For example , the Omaha Storm Chasers ( formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes ) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969 , but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations , after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979 , to the Washington Nationals in 2007 , and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Indians since 2009 . A few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club , such as the Springfield Cardinals , owned by the St. Louis Cardinals , and all of the Atlanta Braves ' affiliates except the Florida Fire Frogs . Minor League teams that are owned directly by the major league club do not have PDCs with the parent club and are typically not part of the reaffiliation shuffles that occur after each even-numbered season . Today , there are 14 MLB-affiliated minor leagues with a total of 160 revenue-generating teams , located in large , medium , and small cities and suburbs across the United States and Canada , and there are three MLB-affiliated rookie leagues with a total of 80 teams , located in Arizona , Florida , and the Dominican Republic , though these teams do not generate revenue .",
  "/wiki/Turing_Award": "The ACM A.M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) to an individual selected for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field . The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and thus as the Nobel Prize of computing . The award is named after Alan Turing , a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester . Turing is often credited as being the key founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence . From 2007 to 2013 , the award was accompanied by an additional prize of US $ 250,000 , with financial support provided by Intel and Google . Since 2014 , the award has been accompanied by a prize of US $ 1 million , with financial support provided by Google . The first recipient , in 1966 , was Alan Perlis , of Carnegie Mellon University . The first female recipient was Frances E. Allen of IBM in 2006 .",
  "/wiki/Alan_Turing": "Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS ( /\u02c8tj\u028a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/ ; 23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954 ) was an English mathematician , computer scientist , logician , cryptanalyst , philosopher , and theoretical biologist . Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science , providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine , which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer . Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence . Despite these accomplishments , he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime , due to his homosexuality , and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act . During the Second World War , Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) at Bletchley Park , Britain 's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence . For a time he led Hut 8 , the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis . Here , he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers , including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine . Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war . Due to the problems of counterfactual history , it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war , but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives . After the war , Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory , where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine , which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer . In 1948 , Turing joined Max Newman 's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester , where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology . He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction , first observed in the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Twyman\u2013Stokes_Teammate_of_the_Year_Award": "The Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award is an annual National Basketball Association ( NBA ) award that recognizes the league 's ideal teammate who exemplifies selfless play and commitment and dedication to his team . The award is named after Jack Twyman and Maurice Stokes . The two played together on the Rochester/Cincinnati Royals from 1955 to 1958 until Stokes ' career was cut short after he suffered a head injury from a fall during a game against the Minneapolis Lakers . Stokes would later become paralyzed due to post-traumatic encephalopathy ; a brain injury that damages the motor-control center . Twyman then became Stokes ' legal guardian and advocate until Stokes died in 1970 . Every year , 12 players , six from each conference , are selected by a panel of NBA legends as nominees . NBA players then cast votes for the award , with ten points given for each first-place vote , seven for a second-place vote , five points for third , three points for fourth , and one point for each fifth-place vote received . The player with the highest point total , regardless of the number of first-place votes , wins the award . The winner of this award is presented with the Twyman-Stokes Trophy . As a part of the award , the NBA also makes a $ 25,000 donation to charity of the recipient 's choice . Los Angeles Clippers guard Chauncey Billups was the inaugural winner of the award in 2013 . That year , Miami Heat forward Shane Battier finished second and New York Knicks guard Jason Kidd placed third .",

  "/wiki/Joseph_Tyrrell": "Joseph Burr Tyrrell , FRSC ( November 1 , 1858 - August 26 , 1957 ) was a Canadian geologist , cartographer and mining consultant . He discovered dinosaur ( Albertosaurus sarcophagus ) bones in Alberta 's Badlands and coal around Drumheller in 1884 . Canada 's Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta was named in his honour . Tyrrell was born in Weston , Ontario , the third child of William and Elizabeth Tyrrell . He was a student at Weston Grammar School before graduating from Upper Canada College in 1876 and receiving a law degree from the University of Toronto in 1880 . However , after articling for a law firm in Toronto , his doctor advised him to work outdoors due to his health . He joined the Geological Survey of Canada in 1880 , leading or participating in numerous explorations . He led the 1893 and 1894 expeditions into the Northern Barren Lands , down the Dubawnt River , the first visit to the Kivalliq Region Barrenlands by a European since the explorations of Samuel Hearne in the 1770s . His younger brother , James Williams Tyrrell , accompanied Tyrrell on the expedition , which included the first European contact with the Ihalmiut , an Inuit people from the interior of what is today Nunavut . Tyrrell married Mary Edith Carey in 1894 and they had three children , Mary ( 1896 ) , George ( 1900 ) , and Thomas ( 1906 ) . Mary Edith was founder and first president in 1921 of the Women 's Association of the Mining Industry of Canada . In 1894 , Tyrrell stumbled upon biographical recollections ( 11 books of field notes , 39 journals , maps and a narrative ) of Canadian overland explorer , cartographer and fur trader David Thompson and , in 1916 , published them as David Thompson 's Narrative .",
  "/wiki/History_of_Canada": "The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day . Prior to European colonization , the lands encompassing present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples , with distinct trade networks , spiritual beliefs , and styles of social organization . Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through archeological investigations . Starting in the late 15th century , French and British expeditions explored , colonized , and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada . The colony of New France was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608 . France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the Seven Years ' War . The now British Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 and reunified in 1841 . In 1867 , the Province of Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia through Confederation , forming a self-governing entity named Canada . The new country expanded by incorporating other parts of British North America , finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949 . Although responsible government had existed in Canada since 1848 , Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the First World War . The passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom . After the Constitution was patriated in 1982 , the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed ."
