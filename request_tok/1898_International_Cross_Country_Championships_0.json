  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",
  "/wiki/Charles_Bennett_(athlete)": "Charles Bennett ( 28 December 1870 - 18 December 1948 ) was a British athlete , winner of the 1500 metres at the 1900 Summer Olympics and the first British track and field athlete to become Olympic champion . He was a member of Finchley Harriers ( founded 1877 ) which was amalgamated into Hillingdon Athletic Club in 1966 . Bennett , a train driver born in Shapwick , Dorset , was one of the top British middle-distance runners in his years , winning the AAA 4-mile ( 6.4 km ) championship in 1897 , and the cross country running title in 1899 and 1900 . In the latter year , also the Olympic year , he won the British title in the mile , qualifying himself for the 1500 m in Paris . That distance had a rather weak field , and Bennett lead throughout the race , defeating local favourite Henri Deloge in 4:06.0 . That time was an official world record , although many athletes had already run faster in competitions over the slightly longer mile . Together with the combined British/Australian 5000 metres team , Bennett won a second Olympic title . Bennett finished first in the race , with an unofficial world record 15:29.2 , beating teammate John Rimmer . His third event was the 4000 m steeplechase , in which he just failed to catch up with the same Rimmer in the final part of the race , settling for second place . Bennett died in Bournemouth , aged 79 . His Olympic achievements were largely forgotten for more than 100 years until his grandson Chris Bennett found his abandoned and overgrown grave in the corner of St Andrews Churchyard in Kinson . In December 2011 Bennett was commemorated after Anthony Ives Memorials of Bournemouth donated a proper headstone to recognise his feat .",

  "/wiki/France": "France ( French : [ f\u0281\u0251\u0303s ] ( listen ) ) , officially the French Republic ( French : R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise , pronounced [ \u0281epyblik f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ( listen ) ) , is a country whose territory consists of metropolitan France in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories . [ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) .

France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
