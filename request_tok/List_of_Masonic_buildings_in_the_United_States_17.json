  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_architecture": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years ."
