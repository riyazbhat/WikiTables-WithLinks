  "/wiki/Osam_Abdul_Rahan_Ahmad": "As of May 1 , 2018 , 40 detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay , according to the Federal government of the United States . This list of Guant\u00e1namo prisoners has the known identities of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba , but is compiled from various sources and is incomplete . In official documents , the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) continues to make intermittent efforts to redact prisoner 's names , and has not published an official list of detainees ( as of September 2005 [ update ] ) . On April 19 , 2006 , the DoD released a list with 558 names in what appears to be a fax or other scanned image . The Associated Press published the list in more accessible text form . The Washington Post maintains a list of the prisoners known or suspected to have been held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay . On March 3 , 2006 the DoD partially complied with a court order to release the names of the remaining Guant\u00e1namo detainees . The court order required the DoD to release the names of all the detainees . Initially , the DoD released only 317 names . On April 19 , 2006 , the DoD released a list with 558 names . Although Justice Jed Rakoff had already dismissed this argument , Pentagon spokesmen Bryan Whitman justified withholding the names out of a concern for the detainees ' privacy . On April 20 , 2006 , the DoD released a portable document format file that listed 558 names ."
