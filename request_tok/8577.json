As general manager and team president of the Celtics , he won an additional seven NBA titles , for a grand total of 16 in a span of 29 years , making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports . Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball , redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the fast break as a potent offensive weapon . He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame . Additionally , Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA . He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player , Chuck Cooper in 1950 , introduced the first African-American starting five in 1964 , and hired the first African-American head coach in North American sports ( Bill Russell in 1966 ) . Famous for his polarizing nature , he was well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured , a habit that became , for many , the ultimate symbol of victory during his Boston tenure . In 1967 , the NBA Coach of the Year award , which he had won in 1965 , was named the Red Auerbach Trophy , and Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969 . In 1980 , he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America , and was NBA Executive of the Year in 1980 .
