The Mussolini goose then delivers a speech to the only listener : a little chick who had been forced to stay and applaud . After these happenings , storm troopers are sent marching across the area , while the Dove of Peace ( imitation of Charles Laughton , possibly representing Franklin Roosevelt ) , grieves at what is happening ( Have they forgot ? 'T is love that 's right , and naught is gained by show of might. ) . A group of chickens and the Mussolini goose are then seen at what appears to be a Peace Conference , in which the Hitler duck slaps the Mussolini goose for dim-wittedly taking part in it and puts the newly signed peace treaty through a shredder , whereupon everyone in the Peace Conference area brawl against each other .",
