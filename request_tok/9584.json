Today Watts is a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood with a significant African American minority , and remains one of the most impoverished and dangerous neighborhoods in Los Angeles despite falling crime rates since the 1990s . Notable civic activities by residents of Watts include the Toys for Watts toy drive , the Watts Christmas parade , and the Watts Summer Games athletic tournament , as well as a local theatre and a dance company , in an effort to improve the neighborhood .
