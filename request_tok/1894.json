  "/wiki/Silverthrone_Caldera": "The Silverthrone Caldera is a potentially active caldera complex in southwestern British Columbia , Canada , located over 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) northwest of the city of Vancouver and about 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) west of Mount Waddington in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains . The caldera is one of the largest of the few calderas in western Canada , measuring about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) long ( north-south ) and 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) wide ( east-west ) . Mount Silverthrone , an eroded lava dome on the caldera 's northern flank that is 2,864 metres ( 9,396 ft ) high , may be the highest volcano in Canada . The main glaciers in the Silverthrone area are the Pashleth , Kingcome , Trudel , Klinaklini and Silverthrone glaciers . Most of the caldera lies in the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield , which is the largest icefield in the southern half of the Coast Mountains ; it is one of the five icefields in southwestern British Columbia that thinned between the mid-1980s and 1999 due to global warming . Nearly half of the icefield is drained by the Klinaklini Glacier , which feeds the Klinaklini River . The Silverthrone Caldera is very remote and rarely visited or studied by geoscientists , such as volcanologists . It can be reached by helicopter or - with major difficulty - by hiking along one of the several river valleys extending from the British Columbia Coast or from the Interior Plateau .",
  "/wiki/Caldera": "A caldera is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber/reservoir in a volcanic eruption . When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time , structural support for the rock above the magma chamber is lost . The ground surface then collapses downward into the emptied or partially emptied magma chamber , leaving a massive depression at the surface ( from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter ) . Although sometimes described as a crater , the feature is actually a type of sinkhole , as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact . Only seven caldera-forming collapses are known to have occurred since 1900 , most recently at B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano , Iceland in 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Franklin_Glacier_Complex": "The Franklin Glacier Complex is a deeply eroded volcano in the Waddington Range of southwestern British Columbia , Canada . Located about 65 km ( 40 mi ) northeast of Kingcome , this sketchily known complex resides at Franklin Glacier near Mount Waddington . It is over 2,000 m ( 6,600 ft ) in elevation and because of its considerable overall altitude , a large proportion of the complex is covered by glacial ice . Magmatic activity of the Franklin Glacier Complex spanned roughly four million years from the Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene , with the most recently identified volcanic eruption having taken place around 2.2 million years ago . The existence of thermal springs near the complex implies that magmatic heat is still present . It has therefore been of interest to geothermal exploration .",
  "/wiki/Pleistocene": "The Pleistocene ( /\u02c8pla\u026as.t\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n , -to\u028a-/ PLYSE-t\u0259-seen , -\u2060toh- , often colloquially referred to as the Ice Age ) is the geological epoch that lasted from about 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago , spanning the world 's most recent period of repeated glaciations . The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP . Publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period .",
  "/wiki/Bridge_River_Cones": "The Bridge River Cones , sometimes referred to as the Lillooet Cones and Salal Creek Cones , is the name given to a volcanic field located on the north flank of the upper Bridge River , about 40 km ( 25 mi ) west of the town of Gold Bridge . The cones are in the lee of the Lillooet Icecap and sit astride a group of passes between the Bridge River , which flows W-E to their south , and the Lord River , which flows north to the Taseko Lakes in the Chilcotin District .",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_field": "A volcanic field is an area of the Earth 's crust that is prone to localized volcanic activity . They usually contain 10 to 100 volcanoes such as cinder cones and are usually in clusters . Lava flows may also occur . They may occur as a monogenetic volcanic field or a polygenetic volcanic field .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Meager_massif": "The Mount Meager massif is a group of volcanic peaks in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in southwestern British Columbia , Canada . Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc of western North America , it is located 150 km ( 93 mi ) north of Vancouver at the northern end of the Pemberton Valley and reaches a maximum elevation of 2,680 m ( 8,790 ft ) . The massif is capped by several eroded volcanic edifices , including lava domes , volcanic plugs and overlapping piles of lava flows ; these form at least six major summits including Mount Meager which is the second highest of the massif . The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt ( GVB ) has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to the surrounding region . Any volcanic hazard ranging from landslides to eruptions could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife . Although the massif has not erupted for more than 2,000 years , it could produce a major eruption ; if this were to happen , relief efforts would be quickly organized . Teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan ( IVENP ) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada . The Mount Meager massif produced the largest volcanic eruption in Canada in the last 10,000 years . About 2,400 years ago , an explosive eruption formed a volcanic crater on its northeastern flank and sent avalanches of hot ash , rock fragments and volcanic gases down the northern flank of the volcano . Evidence for more recent volcanic activity has been documented at the volcano , such as hot springs and earthquakes . The Mount Meager massif has also been the source of several large landslides in the past , including a massive debris flow in 2010 that swept down Meager Creek and the Lillooet River .",
  "/wiki/Complex_volcano": "A complex volcano , also called a compound volcano , is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock . They may form due to changes in eruptive habit or in the location of the principal vent area on a particular volcano . Stratovolcanoes can also form a large caldera that gets filled in by a lava dome , or else multiple small cinder cones , lava domes and craters may develop on the caldera 's rim . Although a comparatively unusual type of volcano , they are widespread in the world and in geologic history . Metamorphosed ash flow tuffs are widespread in the Precambrian rocks of northern New Mexico , which indicates that caldera complexes have been important for much of Earth 's history . Yellowstone National Park is on three partly covered caldera complexes . The Long Valley Caldera in eastern California is also a complex volcano ; the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado are formed on a group of Neogene-age caldera complexes , and most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks of Nevada , Idaho , and eastern California are also caldera complexes and their erupted ash flow tuffs . The Bennett Lake Caldera in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory is another example of a Cenozoic ( Eocene ) caldera complex .",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present ( BP ) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology , geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past . Because the present time changes , standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ( epoch ) of the age scale , [ a ] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s . The abbreviation BP has been interpreted retrospectively as Before Physics ; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere , making dating after that time likely to be unreliable . In a convention that is not always observed , many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating ; the alternative notation RCYBP is explicitly Radio Carbon Years Before Present .",
  "/wiki/Ring_Mountain_(British_Columbia)": "Ring Mountain , also called Crucible Dome , is a tuya in the Mount Cayley volcanic field , British Columbia , Canada . It has a horseshoe shaped crater , located on the east side of the upper Squamish River . Outcrops on Ring Mountain 's western side contain highly variable , fine-scale jointing and are locally broken down into many small spires and knobs . The age of Ring Mountain is unknown , but probably formed during the Fraser Glaciation like most tuyas in Canada .",
  "/wiki/Tuya": "A tuya is a type of distinctive , flat-topped , steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet . They are somewhat rare worldwide , being confined to regions which were covered by glaciers and had active volcanism during the same period . Lava that erupts under a glacier cools very quickly and can not travel far , so it piles up into a steep-sided hill . If the eruption continues long enough , it either melts all the ice or emerges through the top of the ice and then creates normal-looking lava flows that make a flat cap on top of the hill . Discovering and dating the lava flows in a tuya has proven useful in reconstructing past glacial ice extents and thicknesses .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Cayley_massif": "The Mount Cayley massif is a group of mountains in the Pacific Ranges of southwestern British Columbia , Canada . Located 45 km ( 28 mi ) north of Squamish and 24 km ( 15 mi ) west of Whistler , the massif resides on the edge of the Powder Mountain Icefield . It consists of an eroded but potentially active stratovolcano that towers over the Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys . All major summits have elevations greater than 2,000 m ( 6,600 ft ) , Mount Cayley being the highest at 2,385 m ( 7,825 ft ) . The surrounding area has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for more than 7,000 years while geothermal exploration has taken place there for the last four decades . Part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt , the Mount Cayley massif was formed by subduction zone volcanism along the western margin of North America . Eruptive activity began about 4,000,000 years ago and has since undergone three stages of growth , the first two of which built most of the massif . The latest eruptive period occurred sometime in the last 400,000 years with lesser activity continuing into the present day . Future eruptions are likely to threaten neighbouring communities with pyroclastic flows , lahars ( volcanically induced mudslides , landslides and debris flows ) and floods . To monitor this threat , the volcano and its surroundings are monitored by the Geological Survey of Canada ( GSC ) . Eruption impact would be largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in nearby valleys .",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice and ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia , known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 , and Vesuvius in Italy , whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , with fewer deaths . The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated . The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars , for example the Zephyria Tholus .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Fee": "Mount Fee is a volcanic peak in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in southwestern British Columbia , Canada . It is located 13 km ( 8.1 mi ) south of Callaghan Lake and 21 km ( 13 mi ) west of the resort town of Whistler . With a summit elevation of 2,162 m ( 7,093 ft ) and a topographic prominence of 312 m ( 1,024 ft ) , it rises above the surrounding rugged landscape on an alpine mountain ridge . This mountain ridge represents the base of a north-south trending volcanic field which Mount Fee occupies . The mountain consists of a narrow north-south trending ridge of fine-grained volcanic rock and small amounts of fragmental material . It is 1.5 km ( 0.93 mi ) long and 0.5 km ( 0.31 mi ) wide with nearly vertical flanks . Mount Fee has two main summits , the southern tower of which is the highest . The summits are separated by a U-shaped crevice that gives them a prominent appearance .",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_plug": "A volcanic plug , also called a volcanic neck or lava neck , is a volcanic object created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano . When present , a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if rising volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it , and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption . Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side , while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side . Such landforms are called crag and tail . If a plug is preserved , erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains , producing a distinctive upstanding landform .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Brew_(Cheakamus_River)": "Mount Brew is a rounded mountain in southwestern British Columbia , Canada , located 18 km ( 11 mi ) southwest of Whistler in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains . A public cabin run by the Varsity Outdoor Club , Brew Hut , is located near the summit . The alpine area is a popular destination for hiking in the summer and backcountry ski touring in the winter and spring . Mount Brew is a volcanic feature in the Mount Cayley volcanic field of the central Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of the Canadian Cascade Arc . It formed during the Pleistocene period when volcanic activity in this area occurred under glacial ice during the last glacial period . Although it had a vigorous start , the eruption that formed Mount Brew was not sufficiently sustained to form a larger edifice that could break through the surrounding ice and water to form a tuya . Instead , the eruption produced a subglacial mound .",
  "/wiki/Subglacial_volcano": "A subglacial volcano , also known as a glaciovolcano , is a volcanic form produced by subglacial eruptions or eruptions beneath the surface of a glacier or ice sheet which is then melted into a lake by the rising lava . Today they are most common in Iceland and Antarctica ; older formations of this type are found also in British Columbia and Yukon Territory , Canada . During the eruption , the heat of the lava from the subglacial volcano melts the overlying ice . The water quickly cools the lava , resulting in pillow lava shapes similar to those of underwater volcanoes . When the pillow lavas break off and roll down the volcano slopes , pillow breccia , tuff breccia , and hyaloclastite form . The meltwater may be released from below the ice as happened in Iceland in 1996 when the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn caldera erupted , melting 3 km3 of ice and giving rise to a large glacial lake outburst flood . The shape of subglacial volcanoes tends to be quite characteristic and unusual , with a flattened top and steep sides supported against collapse by the pressure of the surrounding ice and meltwater . If the volcano eventually melts completely through the ice layer , then horizontal lava flows are deposited , and the top of the volcano assumes a nearly level form . However , if significant amounts of lava are later erupted subaerially , then the volcano may assume a more conventional shape . In Canada the volcanos have been known to form both conical and nearly level shapes . The more distinctly flat-topped , steep-sided subglacial volcanoes are called tuyas , named after Tuya Butte in northern British Columbia by Canadian geologist Bill Mathews in 1947 . In Iceland , such volcanoes are also known as table mountains .",

  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments , such as either volcanic clinkers , volcanic ash , or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent . The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single , typically cylindrical , vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders , clinkers , or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical ; with slopes between 30-40\u00b0 ; and a nearly circular ground plan .

It began approximately 11,650 cal years before present , after the last glacial period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period . The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period , known as MIS 1 . It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch , called the Flandrian interglacial . The Holocene corresponds with rapid proliferation , growth and impacts of the human species worldwide , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present . Human impacts on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species , including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence , or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of human impacts . In July 2018 , the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections , Greenlandian ( 11,700 years ago to 8,326 years ago ) , Northgrippian ( 8,326 years ago to 4,200 years ago ) and Meghalayan ( 4,200 years ago to the present ) , as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy .

A large provincial park surrounds Mount Price and other volcanoes in its vicinity . Its northern and western flanks are overlapped by smaller volcanic edifices , including Clinker Peak , which was the source for two thick lava flows 15,000-12,000 years ago that ponded against glacial ice . These volcanoes were formed by volcanic eruptions from secondary vents rather than individual ones . As a result , Clinker Peak and other flank volcanoes are interpreted to be part of Mount Price .

The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18 % fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",
