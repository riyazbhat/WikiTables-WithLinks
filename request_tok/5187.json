  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants , bars and amusement arcades . Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",

Alongside Konami , Namco and Sega , it is one of the most prominent video game companies from Japan and the first that exported its games into other countries . Several of its games have since been recognized as important and revolutionary for the industry - Space Invaders in particular was a major contributor to the growth of video games in the mid-1970s , and the aliens featured in the games are seen as iconic emblems within the video game industry . The company maintains a chain of arcade centers , known as Game Taito Stations , across Japan , alongside being a manufacturer of toys , plush dolls and UFO-catcher prizes . It is currently housed in Shinjuku Bunka Quint Building in Yoyogi , Shibuya , the same building as parent company Square Enix .",
  "/wiki/Stealth_game": "A stealth game is a type of video game in which the player primarily uses stealth to avoid or overcome antagonists . Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding , sneaking , or using disguises . Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists , but rewarding the player for greater use of stealth . The genre has employed espionage , counter-terrorism , and rogue themes , with protagonists who are special forces operatives , spies , thieves , ninjas , or assassins . Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres , such as first-person shooters and platformers . Elements of stealth gameplay , by way of avoiding confrontation with enemies , can be attributed to a diverse range of games , including Pac Man ( 1980 ) . Early maze games have been credited with spawning the genre , including Manbiki Shounen ( 1979 ) , Lupin III ( 1980 ) , Castle Wolfenstein ( 1981 ) , 005 ( 1981 ) and Metal Gear ( 1987 ) . The genre became a mainstream success in 1998 , with Tenchu : Stealth Assassins , Metal Gear Solid and Thief : The Dark Project all being released in that year .

  "/wiki/Cliff_Hanger_(video_game)": "Cliff Hanger is a laserdisc video game that was released by Stern Electronics in 1983 . It uses animation from two Lupin III films , most prominently The Castle of Cagliostro , as well as The Mystery of Mamo . Like many laserdisc games , it is a reactive game which requires the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction when prompted by the game to progress the storyline . The segments from The Mystery of Mamo use the original English dub commissioned by Toho , while the segments from The Castle of Cagliostro use a dub created for the game . The voice actors for this game are unknown . The game 's plot is based very loosely on that of The Castle of Cagliostro , and follows Cliff ( Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III ) as he attempts to rescue Clarissa ( Lady Clarisse d'Cagliostro ) from the evil Count Draco ( in some materials called Dreyco and in the instruction manual Dragoe ) , who wants to marry her . Cliff is aided in his quest by Jeff ( Daisuke Jigen ) and Samurai ( Goemon Ishikawa XIII ) . The original version of Cliff Hanger features an animated sequence of Cliff being hanged at the gallows immediately following the miss animation sequence . The sequence was taken from the opening sequence of The Mystery of Mamo ( where Lupin was supposedly hanged in Transylvania ) , plus a later scene in the same film . According to the instruction manual , a setting on the game cabinet 's logic board would allow the individual owners/operators the option of not playing the sequence if they so chose . The game was originally edited at Associated Audio Visual , Inc. , in Evanston , Illinois . Jack Bornoff , was the editor , Paul Rubenstein , was editorial supervisor .",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",

  "/wiki/Adventure_game": "In video game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving . The genre 's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media , literature and film , encompassing a wide variety of literary genres . Many adventure games ( text and graphic ) are designed for a single player , since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult . Colossal Cave Adventure is identified [ by whom ? ] as the first such adventure game , first released in 1976 , while other notable adventure game series include Zork , King 's Quest , The Secret of Monkey Island , and Myst . Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based , using text parsers to translate the player 's input into commands . As personal computers became more powerful with better graphics , the graphic adventure-game format became popular , initially by augmenting player 's text commands with graphics , but soon moving towards point-and-click interfaces . Further computer advances led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective . For markets in the Western hemisphere , the genre 's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many [ quantify ] considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres , but it had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of first-person shooters , and it became difficult for developers to find publishers to support adventure-game ventures . Since then , a resurgence in the genre has occurred , spurred on by the success of independent video-game development , particularly from crowdfunding efforts , from the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches , and from the proliferation of new gaming platforms , including portable consoles and mobile devices . The Walking Dead is considered [ by whom ? ] to be a key title which rejuvenated the genre .",

Music video games may take a variety of forms and are often grouped with puzzle games due to their common use of rhythmically generated puzzles . Music video games are distinct from purely audio games ( e.g . the 1997 Sega Saturn release Real Sound : Kaze no Regret ) in that they feature a visual feedback , to lead the player through the game 's soundtrack , although eidetic music games can fall under both categories .

  "/wiki/Sega_Naomi": "Sega is a video game developer , publisher , and hardware development company headquartered in Tokyo , Japan , with multiple offices around the world . The company 's involvement in the arcade game industry began as a distributor of games and jukeboxes in Japan , but because Sega imported second-hand machines that required frequent maintenance , it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games . This began the company 's transition from importer to manufacturer . According to former Sega director Akira Nagai , this led to the company developing their own games . Sega released Pong-Tron , its first video-based game , in 1973 . The company prospered from the arcade game boom of the late 1970s , with revenues climbing to over US $ 100 million by 1979 . Nagai has stated that Hang-On and Out Run helped to pull the arcade game market out of the 1982 downturn and created new genres of video games . In terms of arcades , Sega is the world 's most prolific arcade game producer , having developed more than 500 games , 70 franchises , and 20 arcade system boards since 1981 . It has been recognized by Guinness World Records for this achievement . The following list comprises the various arcade system boards developed and used by Sega in their arcade games .",

  "/wiki/Light_gun": "A light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games , typically shaped to resemble a pistol . In aviation and shipping , it can also be a directional signal lamp . Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun , which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target ( s ) . The first device of this type , the light pen , was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer . The light gun and its ancestor the light pen are now rarely used as pointing devices due largely to the popularity of the mouse and changes in monitor display technology - conventional light guns work only with CRT monitors .

The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium . The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs , unlike its competitors , and focused on gaming instead . The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable , which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller . The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 . The newer model has updated firmware that disables Action Replay cheats and cheat codes ( a newer version was developed to circumvent this ) and the disc-reading laser was improved in many ways , though it is not as durable ."
