  "/wiki/Trance_music": "Trance is a genre of electronic music that emerged from the British new-age music scene and the early 1990s German techno and hardcore scenes . At the same time trance music was developing in Europe , the genre was also gathering a following in the Indian state of Goa . Trance music is characterized by a tempo lying between 110-150 bpm ( BPM ) , repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 peaks or drops . Although trance is a genre of its own , it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno , house , pop , chill-out , classical music , tech house , ambient and film music . A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness . This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release . A common characteristic of trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely , leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again . Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs . Trance is mostly instrumental , although vocals can be mixed in : typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists , often without a traditional verse/chorus structure . Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre , which has been described as grand , soaring , and operatic and ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths . However , male singers , such as Jonathan Mendelsohn , are also featured .",

The series itself is the longest running music compilation in the entire world . It has been running for over twenty-five years and the current list consists of 250 volumes ( not counting the many Super Eurobeat presents albums ) . Originally , Time Records , Flea Records and Discomagic were some of the record labels that appeared on the original Super Eurobeat albums . The series began as an Italian Beat Freak release . After eight non-stop albums , the series was changed over to Avex and that was when A-Beat C joined in .

The last volume originally was considered : Super Eurobeat Vol.250 but in a recent interview with SEB Adviser and resident DJ , DJ BOSS ( Y & Co . Ltd. ) he confirmed that Super Eurobeat would definitely be continuing but as a yearly release only . Most SEB albums feature the same group of artists , most of which are aliases , such as the following : Pamsy , Cherry , Rich Hard , Dream Fighters , Dave Rodgers , Manuel , Hotblade , and more .",

Fingers , Marshall Jefferson , Phuture , and many others . It 's origins derive from within the Black American LGBT communities but has since spread to the mainstream .

It has spawned numerous subgenres , such as acid house , deep house , hip house , ghetto house , progressive house , tech house , electro house , and many more . House has had and still has a huge impact on pop music in general and dance music in particular .

Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music , but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music , such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys , which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s . J-pop was further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars , then Eurobeat in the early 1990s , namely Namie Amuro . Eventually , J-pop replaced kay\u014dkyoku ( Lyric Singing Music , a term for Japanese pop music from the 1920s to the 1980s ) in the Japanese music scene . The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music and now refers to most Japanese popular music .

The central rhythm is often in common time ( 4/4 ) , while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute ( bpm ) .

Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland 's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized , and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular . Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synth/techno-pop by artists such as Kraftwerk , Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house , electro , funk . Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society , with Alvin Toffler 's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference . Some producers view the style as an expression of technological spirituality . The music produced in the mid to late 1980s by Juan Atkins , Derrick May , and Kevin Saunderson ( collectively known as the Belleville Three ) , along with Eddie Fowlkes , Blake Baxter and James Pennington is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit . During the late 1980s in the UK the term techno was established as a name for the genre following the release of the 1988 compilation Techno ! The New Dance Sound of Detroit . Techno also became popular in other European countries , in particular Germany , but also Belgium and the Netherlands .
