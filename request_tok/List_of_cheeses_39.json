It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 . On 12 December 2017 , the Portuguese Navy commemorated the 700th anniversary of its official creation by King Denis of Portugal .

Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal , and have been used for milk , meat , fur and skins across much of the world . Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese . Female goats are referred to as does or nannies , intact males are called bucks or billies and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids . Castrated males are called wethers . While the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality , hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats . In 2011 , there were more than 924 million goats living in the world , according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization .",

  "/wiki/Cheese": "Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors , textures , and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein . It comprises proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep . During production , the milk is usually acidified , and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation . The solids are separated and pressed into final form . Some cheeses have molds on the rind , the outer layer , or throughout . Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature . Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries . Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and how long they have been aged for . Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents . The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto . Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black pepper , garlic , chives or cranberries . A cheesemonger , or specialist seller of cheeses , may have expertise with selecting the cheeses , purchasing , receiving , storing and ripening them .",

  "/wiki/Curd": "Curd is a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling . The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar , and then allowing it to coagulate . The increased acidity causes the milk proteins ( casein ) to tangle into solid masses , or curds . Milk that has been left to sour ( raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria ) will also naturally produce curds , and sour milk cheeses are produced this way . Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking ; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents ( molds for blue cheeses , etc . ) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese . The remaining liquid , which contains only whey proteins , is the whey . In cow 's milk , 90 percent of the proteins are caseins . In Indian English , used only in the Indian subcontinent , curd or curds instead refers to the traditional homemade yogurt ( also known as dahi ) , while paneer and chhena are used to denote curdled milk . Though people often consider curd and yogurt to be the same , there 's a thin line of difference between the two . The preparation of curd requires a lactobacillus bacteria , while yogurt is made using two specific strains of bacteria called Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp . bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria .",
  "/wiki/Thistle": "Thistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterised by leaves with sharp prickles on the margins , mostly in the family Asteraceae . Prickles can also occur all over the plant - on the stem and on the flat parts of the leaves . These prickles are an adaptation that protects the plant from being eaten by herbivores . Typically , an involucre with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a thistle 's flowerheads . The comparative amount of spininess varies dramatically by species . For example , Cirsium heterophyllum has minimal spininess while Cirsium spinosissimum is the opposite . Typically , species adapted to dry environments have greater spininess . The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean precisely those plants in the tribe Cardueae ( synonym : Cynareae ) , especially the genera Carduus , Cirsium , and Onopordum . However , plants outside this tribe are sometimes called thistles , and when this is done , thistles would form a polyphyletic group . A thistle is the floral emblem of Scotland and Lorraine , as well as the emblem of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica . Biennial thistles are particularly noteworthy for their high wildlife value , producing such things as copious floral resources for pollinators , nourishing seeds for birds like the goldfinch , foliage for butterfly larvae , and down for the lining of birds ' nests .",

  "/wiki/Pasteurisation": "Pasteurization or pasteurisation is a process in which water and certain packaged and non-packaged foods ( such as milk and fruit juice ) are treated with mild heat , usually to less than 100 \u00b0C ( 212 \u00b0F ) , to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life . The process is intended to destroy or deactivate organisms and enzymes that contribute to spoilage or risk of disease , including vegetative bacteria , but not bacterial spores . Since pasteurization is not sterilization , and does not kill spores , a second double pasteurization will extend the quality by killing spores that have germinated . The process was named after the French microbiologist , Louis Pasteur , whose research in the 1880s demonstrated that thermal processing would inactivate unwanted microorganisms in wine . Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization . Today , pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries to achieve food preservation and food safety . Most liquid products are heat treated in a continuous system where heat can be applied using a plate heat exchanger and/or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam .

  "/wiki/Ricotta": "Ricotta ( pronounced [ ri\u02c8k\u0254tta ] in Italian ) is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep , cow , goat , or Italian water buffalo milk whey left over from the production of other cheeses . Like other whey cheeses , it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese , notably albumin and globulin . Ricotta ( literally meaning recooked ) protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation ( by letting it sit for 12-24 hours at room temperature ) . Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling . The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to precipitate , forming a fine curd . Once cooled , it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth , leaving the curd behind . Ricotta curds are creamy white in appearance , and slightly sweet in taste . The fat content changes depending on the brand and the type of milk used . In this form , it is somewhat similar in texture to some cottage cheese variants , though considerably lighter . It is highly perishable . However , ricotta also is made in aged varieties which are preservable for much longer ."
