  "/wiki/Irish_Convention": "The Irish Convention was an assembly which sat in Dublin , Ireland from July 1917 until March 1918 to address the Irish question and other constitutional problems relating to an early enactment of self-government for Ireland , to debate its wider future , discuss and come to an understanding on recommendations as to the best manner and means this goal could be achieved . It was a response to the dramatically altered Irish political climate after the 1916 rebellion and proposed by David Lloyd George , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , in May 1917 to John Redmond , leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party , announcing that 'Ireland should try her hand at hammering out an instrument of government for her own people ' . The Convention was publicly called in June 1917 , to be composed of representative Irishmen from different political parties and spheres of interest . After months of deliberations , the Convention 's final report - which had been agreed upon in March 1918 - was seriously undermined . With the urgent need for military manpower on the Western Front following the German Spring Offensive , the government decided in April 1918 to simultaneously introduce Home Rule and apply conscription to Ireland . This dual policy of conscription and devolution heralded the end of a political era .",
  "/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914": "The Government of Ireland Act 1914 ( 4 & 5 Geo . 5 c. 90 ) , also known as the Home Rule Act , and before enactment as the Third Home Rule Bill , was an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom intended to provide home rule ( self-government within the United Kingdom ) for Ireland . It was the third such bill introduced by a Liberal government in a 28-year period in response to the Irish Home Rule movement . The Act was the first law ever passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom that sought to establish a devolved government in any part of the UK . However , the implementation of both it and the equally controversial Welsh Church Act 1914 was formally postponed for a minimum of twelve months with the outbreak of the First World War . The continuation of the war beyond 1915 and subsequent developments in Ireland led to further postponements , meaning that the Act never took effect ; it was finally superseded by a fourth home rule bill , enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1920 , which partitioned Ireland , creating Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland , both intended to have Home Rule .",
  "/wiki/First_D\u00e1il": "The First D\u00e1il ( Irish : An Ch\u00e9ad D\u00e1il ) was D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as it convened from 1919 to 1921 . It was the first meeting of the unicameral parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic . In the December 1918 election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom , the Irish republican party Sinn F\u00e9in won a landslide victory in Ireland . In line with their manifesto , its MPs refused to take their seats , and on 21 January 1919 they founded a separate parliament in Dublin called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ( Assembly of Ireland ) . They declared Irish independence , ratifying the Proclamation of the Irish Republic that had been issued in the 1916 Easter Rising , and adopted a provisional constitution . Its first meeting happened on the same day as one of the first engagements of what became the Irish War of Independence . Although the D\u00e1il had not authorised any armed action , it became a symbol of popular resistance and a source of legitimacy for fighting men in the guerrilla war that developed . The D\u00e1il was outlawed by the British government in September 1919 , and thereafter it met in secret . The First D\u00e1il met 21 times and its main business was establishing the Irish Republic . It created the beginnings of an independent Irish government and state apparatus . Following the May 1921 elections , the First D\u00e1il was succeeded by the Second D\u00e1il of 1921-1922 .",
  "/wiki/D\u00e1il_Constitution": "The Constitution of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ( Irish : Bunreacht D\u00e1la \u00c9ireann ) , more commonly known as the D\u00e1il Constitution , was the constitution of the 1919-22 Irish Republic . It was adopted by the First D\u00e1il at its first meeting on 21 January 1919 and remained in operation until 6 December 1922 . As adopted it consisted of five articles . Article 1 declared that the D\u00e1il had full powers to legislate and would consist of representatives elected in elections conducted by the British government . For the exercise of executive power it created a cabinet , answerable to the D\u00e1il , called the Ministry ( Irish : Aireacht ) , headed by a prime minister called the Pr\u00edomh Aire ( in practice also known as the President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ) . The constitution was limited to an outline of the functions of the legislature and the executive ; the D\u00e1il later established a system of D\u00e1il Courts , but there was no provision in the constitution on a judiciary . The final article of the constitution declared that it was intended to be a provisional document , in the sense that it was subject to amendment . As adopted the constitution came to only around 370 words . In comparison , the modern Constitution of Ireland has approximately 16,000 words . Overall , the structure of the document was as follows :",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Programme": "The Democratic Programme was a declaration of economic and social principles adopted by the First D\u00e1il at its first meeting on 21 January 1919 . A text of the programme was first adopted in Irish and then in English . Its official Irish title was Cl\u00e1r Oibre Poblac\u00e1naighe . On the national issue , the Sinn F\u00e9in Manifesto for the 1918 election had stressed the long history of Irish resistance to British rule based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood , on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged , on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order , on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression . The party was committed to use any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise . The stance was not inclusive of those who supported or tolerated the link with Britain , and 'alien aggression ' became synonymous with occupation of the island of Ireland , whether by the British forces or by the descendants of the British settlers from earlier centuries . On the social front , the Manifesto linked the nationalist aim of freedom with the opportunity for equality , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence , reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it , and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens . On winning 73 seats , the D\u00e1il voted at its first session for the Democratic Programme , as embodying these ideals and also the Declaration of Independence . The Democratic Program was drafted with the assistance of Thomas Johnson , the leader of the Labour Party , in return for the Labour Party not campaigning in the 1918 election and continuing moral support .",
  "/wiki/Irish_Republic": "The Irish Republic ( Irish : Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann or Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann ) was a revolutionary state that declared its independence from the United Kingdom in January 1919 . The Republic claimed jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland , but by 1920 its functional control was limited to only 21 of Ireland 's 32 counties , and British state forces maintained a presence across much of the north-east , as well as Cork , Dublin and other major towns . The republic was most strong in rural areas and was able to influence the population in urban areas that it did not directly control through its military forces . Its origins date back to the Easter Rising of 1916 , when Irish republicans seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic . The insurrection was crushed , but the survivors united under a reformed Sinn F\u00e9in party to campaign for a republic . The party won a clear majority of largely uncontested seats in the 1918 general election , and formed the first D\u00e1il ( legislature ) of Ireland in Dublin on 21 January 1919 . Republicans then established a government , a court system and a police force . At the same time , the Irish Volunteers , who came under the control of the D\u00e1il and became known as the Irish Republican Army , fought against British state forces in the Irish War of Independence . The War of Independence ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty , signed on 6 December 1921 and narrowly approved by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 7 January 1922 . A Provisional Government was set up under the terms of the treaty , but the Irish Republic nominally remained in existence until 6 December 1922 , when 26 of the island 's 32 counties became a self-governing British dominion called the Irish Free State . The island had been partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 , and the six counties of Northern Ireland , which had been partitioned artificially so as to create and ensure a unionist majority , exercised their right under the treaty to opt out of the Free State , and remain in the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Constituent_assembly": "A constituent assembly or constitutional assembly is a body or assembly of popularly elected representatives which is assembled for the purpose of drafting or adopting a constitution or similar document . The constituent assembly is entirely elected by popular vote [ citation needed ] ; that is , all constituent assemblies are constitutional conventions , but a constitutional convention is not necessarily a constituent assembly . As the fundamental document constituting a state , a constitution can not normally be modified or amended by the state 's normal legislative procedures [ citation needed ] ; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly , the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution , must be set up . A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose , which it carries out in a relatively short time , after which the assembly is dissolved . A constituent assembly is a form of representative democracy . Unlike forms of constitution-making in which a constitution is unilaterally imposed by a sovereign lawmaker , the constituent assembly creates a constitution through internally imposed actions , in that members of the constituent assembly are themselves citizens , but not necessarily the rulers , of the country for which they are creating a constitution . As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster : Constitutions arise in a number of different ways . At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum , we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations . At the democratic extreme , we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution . And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements .",
  "/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty": "The Anglo-Irish Treaty ( Irish : An Conradh Angla-\u00c9ireannach ) , commonly known as The Treaty and officially the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty Between Great Britain and Ireland , was an agreement between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and representatives of the Irish Republic that concluded the Irish War of Independence . It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State within a year as a self-governing dominion within the community of nations known as the British Empire , a status the same as that of the Dominion of Canada . It also provided Northern Ireland , which had been created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 , an option to opt out of the Irish Free State , which it exercised . The agreement was signed in London on 6 December 1921 , by representatives of the British government ( which included Prime Minister David Lloyd George , who was head of the British delegates ) and by representatives of the Irish Republic including Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith . The Irish representatives had plenipotentiary status ( negotiators empowered to sign a treaty without reference back to their superiors ) acting on behalf of the Irish Republic , though the British government declined to recognise that status . As required by its terms , the agreement was approved by a meeting of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and [ separately ] by the British Parliament . In reality , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ( the legislative assembly for the de facto Irish Republic ) first debated then approved the treaty ; members then went ahead with the meeting . Though the treaty was narrowly approved , the split led to the Irish Civil War , which was won by the pro-treaty side . The Irish Free State as contemplated by the treaty came into existence when its constitution became law on 6 December 1922 by a royal proclamation .",

In accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution , the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 of the British Parliament , which came into effect upon receiving the royal assent on 5 December 1922 , provided that the Constitution would come into effect upon the issue of a Royal Proclamation , which was done on 6 December 1922 . In 1937 the Constitution of the Irish Free State was replaced by the modern Constitution of Ireland following a referendum . As enacted , the Constitution of the Irish Free State was firmly shaped by the requirements of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that had been negotiated between the British government and Irish leaders in 1921 . However , following a change of government in 1932 and the adoption of the Statute of Westminster a series of amendments progressively removed many of the provisions that had been required by the Treaty . The Constitution established a parliamentary system of government under a form of constitutional monarchy , and contained guarantees of certain fundamental rights . It was intended that the constitution would be a rigid document that , after an initial period , could be amended only by referendum . However , amendments were made to the Constitution 's amendment procedure , so that all amendments could be and were in fact made by a simple Act of the Oireachtas ( parliament ) .",

It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and the overseas territories . Parliament is bicameral but has three parts , consisting of the Sovereign ( Queen-in-Parliament ) , the House of Lords , and the House of Commons ( the primary chamber ) . The two houses meet in the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster , one of the inner boroughs of the capital city , London . The House of Lords includes two different types of members : the Lords Spiritual , consisting of the most senior bishops of the Church of England , and the Lords Temporal , consisting mainly of life peers , appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister , and of 92 hereditary peers , sitting either by virtue of holding a royal office , or by being elected by their fellow hereditary peers . Prior to the opening of the Supreme Court in October 2009 , the House of Lords also performed a judicial role through the Law Lords . The House of Commons is an elected chamber with elections to 650 single member constituencies held at least every five years under the first-past-the-post system . The two Houses meet in separate chambers in the Palace of Westminster ( commonly known as the Houses of Parliament ) in London . By constitutional convention , all government ministers , including the Prime Minister , are members of the House of Commons or , less commonly , the House of Lords and are thereby accountable to the respective branches of the legislature . Most cabinet ministers are from the Commons , whilst junior ministers can be from either House . However , the Leader of the House of Lords must be a peer . The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Treaty of Union by Acts of Union passed by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland , both Acts of Union stating , That the United Kingdom of Great Britain be represented by one and the same Parliament to be styled The Parliament of Great Britain .",

That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic , the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) ; and British Crown forces . The Free State was established as a Dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations . It comprised 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland . Northern Ireland , which comprised the remaining six counties , exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the new state . The Free State government consisted of the Governor-General , the representative of the King , and the Executive Council ( cabinet ) , which replaced both the revolutionary D\u00e1il Government and the Provisional Government set up under the Treaty . W. T. Cosgrave , who had led both of these governments since August 1922 , became the first President of the Executive Council ( prime minister ) .

The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 . Although the Troubles primarily took place in Northern Ireland , at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland , England , and mainland Europe . The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic , fuelled by historical events . It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension , although it was not a religious conflict . A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland . Unionists/loyalists , who were mostly Protestants , wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom . Irish nationalists/republicans , who were mostly Catholics , wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland . The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force . The authorities attempted to suppress this protest campaign and were accused of police brutality ; it was also met with violence from loyalists , who alleged it was a republican front .

In ancient Athenian democracy , sortition was the traditional and primary method for appointing political officials , and its use was regarded as a principal characteristic of democracy . Today , sortition is commonly used to select prospective jurors in common law-based legal systems and is sometimes used in forming citizen groups with political advisory power ( citizens ' juries or citizens ' assemblies ) ."
