  "/wiki/Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl": "The Korean alphabet , known as Hangul ( Hangeul ) [ note 1 ] in South Korea or Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea , has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great . It is the official writing system of Korea , both South Korea and North Korea . It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province , China . It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau , Indonesia . A Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode ( 1987 ) developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien , and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin ( see Taiwanese Hangul ) . The Hangul alphabet originally consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters when it was created . As four became obsolete , modern Hangul consists of a total of 24 letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters . In North Korea the total is counted 40 . It consists of 19 consonant letters and 21 vowel letters as it additionally includes 5 tense consonants ( \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3149 \u3146 ) and 6 compound and complex vowel letters as well as \u3150 and \u3154 . The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions . For example , the Korean word for honeybee ( kkulbeol ) is written \uafc0\ubc8c , not \u3132\u315c\u3139\u3142\u3153\u3139 . As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems , it has been described as an alphabetic syllabary by some linguists .",
  "/wiki/Hancha": "Hanja ( Korean : \ud55c\uc790 ; Hanja : \u6f22\u5b57 ; Korean pronunciation : [ ha ( \u02d0 ) nt\u0348\u0255a ] ) [ citation needed ] is the Korean name for Chinese characters ( Chinese : \u6f22\u5b57 ; pinyin : h\u00e0nz\u00ec ) . More specifically , it refers to the Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation . Hanja-mal or Hanja-eo ( the latter is used more often ) refers to words that can be written with Hanja , and hanmun , or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities . Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the etymology of Sino-Korean words , and for enlarging one 's Korean vocabulary . Today , Hanja are not used to write native Korean words , which are always rendered in Hangul , and even words of Chinese origin - Hanja-eo ( \ud55c\uc790\uc5b4 , \u6f22\u5b57\u8a9e ) - are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time , with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics .
