  "/wiki/Wales": "Wales ( Welsh : Cymru [ \u02c8k\u0259mri ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 ( 8,023 sq mi ) . Wales has over 1,680 miles ( 2,700 km ) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .",

The head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a lieutenant governor . Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom . Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC . Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD , and the Manx language , a branch of the Gaelic languages , emerged . In 627 Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia . In the 9th century , Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles , which included the Isle of Man . Magnus III , King of Norway from 1093 to 1103 , reigned also as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103 . In 1266 the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth , after being ruled by Norway . After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England , the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399 . The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765 , but the island never became part of the 18th century kingdom of Great Britain or its successors ( the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the present-day United Kingdom ) . It retained its internal self-government .",

Its population at the 2011 UK Census was 10,651 , distributed evenly across the island 's two Wards of Walney North and Walney South . Walney Island formed during the last glacial period , when the River Duddon was a large glacial lake , depositing till at its mouth , which became Walney . Some evidence of neolithic inhabitants has been found in the island 's sand dunes , though its name is likely of Norse origin . The island remained rural until the growth of Barrow-in-Furness ' industries in the nineteenth century . In particular , the development between 1867 and 1881 of docks at Barrow Island , in Walney Channel opposite Walney , encouraged the growth of Walney as a settlement . The planned worker town of Vickerstown was built on the island in 1898 , resulting in a large population increase , and the construction of Jubilee Bridge connecting Walney to the mainland in 1908 . Walney 's contemporary population now forms about a seventh of the overall population of Barrow-in-Furness . The island contains two nature reserves , at either end , and its sandy beaches make it a popular leisure site .",

The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations .
