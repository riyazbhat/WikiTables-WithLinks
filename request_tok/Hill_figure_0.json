The best views of the figure are obtained from the air , or from directly across the Vale , particularly around the villages of Great Coxwell , Longcot and Fernham . The site is owned and managed by the National Trust and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument . The Guardian stated in 2003 that for more than 3,000 years , the Uffington White Horse has been jealously guarded as a masterpiece of minimalist art . The Uffington Horse is by far the oldest of the white horse figures in Britain and is of an entirely different design from the others inspired by it",

It was restored in 1778 , an action which may have obliterated another horse that had occupied the same slope . A contemporary engraving from the 1760s appears to show a horse facing in the opposite direction that was rather smaller than the present figure . There is , however , no documentation or other evidence for the existence of a chalk horse at Westbury before 1742 .

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating",

Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester .

The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest .

  "/wiki/Kilburn_White_Horse": "The Kilburn White Horse , grid reference SE516813 , is a hill figure cut into the hillside in the North York Moors National Park near Kilburn in North Yorkshire , England . The figure is 318 feet ( 97 m ) long by 220 ft ( 67 m ) high and covers about 1.6 acres ( 6,475.0 m2 ) and said to be the largest and most northerly hill figure in England . Located on the southern flank of Sutton Bank , near Roulston Scar at the edge of the Hambleton table-land , it faces south-south-west and is visible from some distance , particularly from the East Coast Main Line railway south of Thirsk , and from the A19 . On a clear day , the horse is visible from north Leeds , 28 miles ( 45 km ) away on the higher ground to the west of the Vale of York . Sutton Bank , geologically , is formed of sandstone and the horse was created by removing the topsoil and exposing the underlying rock and covering it with white limestone chips . It was created in November 1857 , and some accounts state that it was done by school master John Hodgson and his pupils , together with local volunteers . A tablet erected at the car park below it reads , The Kilburn 'White Horse ' -- This figure was cut in 1857 on the initiative of Thomas Taylor , a native of Kilburn . In 1925 a restoration fund was subscribed by the readers of the Yorkshire Evening Post and the residue of \u00a3100 was invested to provide for the triennial grooming of the figure . However , Morris Marples in his 1949 book gives Thomas Taylor the credit for being the prime mover : a native of Kilburn , he was a buyer for a London provision merchant , and he seems to have attended celebrations at Uffington White Horse in 1857 , and he was inspired to give his home village a similar example . Thirty-three men were involved in cutting it , and 6 tons ( 6.1 metric tonnes ) of lime were used to whiten the exposed rock . Nowadays a car park is provided below the white horse and there is a footpath ascending past it and crossing immediately above it . The image itself is now formed of off-white limestone chips , but the steep gradient of the hillside , especially at the horse 's breast and forelegs , have led to slumping and retention boards have been fixed to restrain this",

Simmonds claimed later that it had been his intention to enlarge the horse gradually over the years , but he had to give up the farm and so did not have the opportunity . The white horse serves as an icon for the village of Broad Town and is generally regarded as one of the most animated white horse figures in Wiltshire , and has been noted for being both conspicuous , due to its being visible for many miles , and the secret white horse , due to its rural location away from main roads .

The nearby Alton Barnes White Horse was cut 27 years later by a Robert Pile of the same address , but is unknown if this is the same man . The horse received a scouring in 1789 , believed to be the first and last scouring , as the landowner objected to the festivities which had accompanied the scouring and thus refused to allow it to happen again . Thus , it fell into neglect , and by the mid-1800s was in a bad state of repair . By the mid-1930s , the chalk of the horse was no longer visible . Nonetheless , the outline of the head and body could still vaguely be seen , both as raised contours revealed by both the light of the rising sun and as a discolouration of the grass . As is visible from a sketch of the contours still visible in 1939 , the horse may have been of fairly good proportions . A local legend says that the horse had a boy rider , but there appears to have been no visible rider in the late 1800s when the chalk was still able to be seen , so this theory has often been refuted . Had it had a rider , it would have been one of two of such horses to do so in England , alongside the 19th century Osmington White Horse near Weymouth , Dorset . In 1937 , George Marples , an authority on hill figures , was in the area researching the horse , which at this time was barely visible , when he was approached by a committee that had just been formed to find a suitable way of commemorating the Coronation of George VI .

Both the traditional and ceremonial East Riding include Kingston upon Hull , but the administrative East Riding does not as Kingston upon Hull is in its own unitary authority . The traditional East Riding covers a larger area than both the ceremonial and administrative East Riding . The East Riding , North Riding and West Riding were treated as three separate counties for many purposes , such as having separate quarter sessions . In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 , administrative counties with a county council were created on the historic boundaries . In 1974 both the Local Government Area and the Lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 , being succeeded in most of the riding by the newly created Humberside which included parts of the West Riding and parts of Lincolnshire . The modern Local Government Area and the ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire were formed in 1996 from the northern part of Humberside upon its abolition . At the 2011 Census , the population was 334,179 . The landscape consists of a crescent of low chalk hills , the Yorkshire Wolds , surrounded by the low-lying fertile plains of Holderness and the Vale of York . The Humber Estuary and North Sea mark its southern and eastern limits"
