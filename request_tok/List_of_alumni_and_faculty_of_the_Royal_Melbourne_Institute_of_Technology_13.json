Tensions emerged within the Pledge Left about her candidacy and she was not selected as a result .",

Victoria has compulsory voting and uses preferential voting in single-member seats for the Legislative Assembly , and single transferable vote in multi-member seats for the proportionally represented Legislative Council . The Council is described as a house of review . Majorities in the Legislative Council are rare , so the government of the day must negotiate with other parties to pass much of its legislative agenda . All members serve four-year terms . The parliament 's functions and processes have evolved over time , undergoing significant changes as Victoria changed from an independent colony to a state within the federated Australia .

  "/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia": "The Parliament of Australia ( officially the Federal Parliament , also called the Commonwealth Parliament ) is the legislative branch of the government of Australia . It consists of three elements : the Crown ( represented by the Governor-General ) , the Senate and the House of Representatives . The combination of two elected chambers , in which the members of the Senate represent the states and territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population , is modelled on the United States Congress . Through both chambers , however , there is a fused executive , drawn from the Westminster system . The upper house , the Senate , consists of 76 members : twelve for each state , and two each for the territories , Northern Territory ( including Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) and the Australian Capital Territory ( including Norfolk Island and the Jervis Bay Territory ) . Senators are elected using the single transferable vote proportional representation system and as a result , the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power . The governing party or coalition has not held a majority in the Senate since 1981 ( except between 2005 and 2007 ) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed . The lower house , the House of Representatives , currently consists of 151 members , each elected using full-preference instant-runoff voting from single-member constituencies known as electoral divisions ( and commonly referred to as electorates or seats ) . This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major political groups , the centre-right Coalition ( consisting of the Liberal and National Parties ) and the centre-left Labor Party . The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power . The House of Representatives has a maximum term of three years , although it can be dissolved early . The Senate has fixed terms , with 36 Senators ' terms expiring every three years ( the terms of the four territory Senators are linked to House elections ) .",
