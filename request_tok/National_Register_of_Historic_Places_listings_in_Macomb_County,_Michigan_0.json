  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line , he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle-class Americans could afford . In doing so , Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century . His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry . As the owner of the Ford Motor Company , he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world . He is credited with Fordism : mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers . Ford had a global vision , with consumerism as the key to peace . His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations , including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents . Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to control the company permanently .

  "/wiki/Paleo-Indian": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",
  "/wiki/Strandline": "A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land . Such a mark is often the result of a flood , but high water marks may reflect an all-time high , an annual high ( highest level to which water rose that year ) or the high point for some other division of time . Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area , particularly in making preparations for flood surges . High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt . It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area , usually with a line at the level to which the water rose , and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set . This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker , or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark . A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark , but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining . A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a strandline and is typically composed of debris left by high tide . The area at the top of a beach where debris is deposited is an example of this phenomenon . Where there are tides , this line is formed by the highest position of the tide , and moves up and down the beach on a fortnightly cycle . The debris is chiefly composed of rotting seaweed , but can also include a large amount of litter , either from ships at sea or from sewage outflows .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
