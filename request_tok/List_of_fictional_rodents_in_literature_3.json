  "/wiki/Beaver": "The beaver ( genus Castor ) is a large , primarily nocturnal , semiaquatic rodent . Castor includes two extant species , the North American beaver ( Castor canadensis ) ( native to North America ) and Eurasian beaver ( Castor fiber ) ( Eurasia ) . Beavers are known for building dams , canals , and lodges ( homes ) . They are the second-largest rodent in the world ( after the capybara ) . Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still , deep water to protect against predators , and to float food and building material . The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million , but as of 1988 was 6-12 million . This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur , for glands used as medicine and perfume , and because the beavers ' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses .",
  "/wiki/C._S._Lewis": "Clive Staples Lewis ( 29 November 1898 - 22 November 1963 ) was a British writer and lay theologian . He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University ( Magdalen College , 1925-1954 ) and Cambridge University ( Magdalene College , 1954-1963 ) . He is best known for his works of fiction , especially The Screwtape Letters , The Chronicles of Narnia , and The Space Trilogy , and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics , such as Mere Christianity , Miracles , and The Problem of Pain . Lewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends . They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings . According to Lewis 's memoir Surprised by Joy , he was baptised in the Church of Ireland , but fell away from his faith during adolescence . Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32 , owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends , and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England . Lewis 's faith profoundly affected his work , and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim . Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies . The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage , TV , radio , and cinema . His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations . In 1956 , Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman ; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45 .",

  "/wiki/Grey_Owl": "Archibald Stansfeld Belaney ( September 18 , 1888 - April 13 , 1938 ) , commonly known as Grey Owl , was a British-born conservationist , fur trapper , and writer who pretended to be a First Nations person . While he achieved fame as a conservationist during his life , after his death the revelation that he was not Indigenous , along with other autobiographical fabrications , negatively affected his reputation . Belaney rose to prominence as a notable author and lecturer , primarily on environmental issues . In working with the National Parks Branch , Grey Owl became the subject of many films , and was established as the 'caretaker of park animals ' at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba in 1931 . Together with his numerous articles , books , films and lectures , his views on conservation reached audiences beyond the borders of Canada . His conservation views largely focused on humans ' negative impact on nature through their commodification of nature 's resources for profits , and a need for humans to develop a respect for the natural world . Recognition of Belaney has included biographies , a historic plaque at his birthplace , and a 1999 biopic about his life by the director Richard Attenborough .",

Those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as Inuit . The M\u00e9tis , another distinct ethnicity , developed after European contact and relations primarily between First Nations people and Europeans . There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada , roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia . Under Charter Jurisprudence , First Nations are a designated group , along with women , visible minorities , and people with physical or mental disabilities . First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada . North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years . Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events , such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption . Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery , beginning in the late 15th century . European accounts by trappers , traders , explorers , and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture . In addition , archeological and anthropological research , as well as linguistics , have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples . Although not without conflict , early Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cers ' , Acadians ' , and Newfoundlanders ' interactions with First Nations , M\u00e9tis , and Inuit populations were less combative compared to the often violent battles between colonists and native peoples in the United States .",

Born into an upper-middle-class household , Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children . She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District , developing a love of landscape , flora , and fauna , all of which she closely observed and painted . Potters study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology . In her thirties , Potter self-published the highly successful children 's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit . Following this , Potter began writing and illustrating children 's books full-time . In all , Potter wrote thirty books ; the best known being her twenty-three children 's tales . With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt , in 1905 Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey , a village in the Lake District which at that time was in Lancashire . Over the following decades , she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape . In 1913 , at the age of 47 , she married William Heelis , a respected local solicitor from Hawkshead . Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation . She continued to write and illustrate , and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children 's books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue .",
  "/wiki/The_Tale_of_Timmy_Tiptoes": "The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children 's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter , and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911 . Timmy Tiptoes is a squirrel believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows , and imprisoned by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement . Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee , a friendly , mischievous chipmunk who has run away from his wife and is camping-out in the tree . Chippy urges the prisoner to eat the nuts stored in the tree , and Timmy does so but grows so fat he can not escape the tree . He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree . The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less than harmonious marriage of the chipmunk . The book sold well at release , but is now considered one of Potter 's weakest productions . Potter never observed the tale 's indigenous North American mammals in nature , and , as a result , her depictions are thought stiff and unnatural . Other elements in the story have come under fire : the rhymes , for example , reveal nothing about the characters nor do they provide an amusing game for the child reader in the manner of the rhymes in The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin . The storm in the finale is viewed as a weak plot device introduced solely to hurry the tale to its conclusion , and the marriage of the chipmunks has been described as abrasive and shocking and an impediment to the flow of the tale . The tale 's disappointing qualities have been ascribed to Potter 's growing lack of interest in writing for children , to pressure from her publisher for yet another book , and to Potter 's desire to exploit the lucrative American market . Potter 's artistically successful books were written for specific children ; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter 's amorphous , ill-defined American fanbase .",

  "/wiki/Guinea_pig": "The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia . Despite their common name , guinea pigs are not native to Guinea , nor are they biologically related to pigs , and the origin of the name is still unclear . They originated in the Andes of South America , and studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C. tschudii , and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild . They were originally domesticated as livestock , as a source of food , and continue to be . In Western society , the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pocket pet , a type of household pet , since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century . Their docile nature , friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding , and the relative ease of caring for them have made and continue to make guinea pigs a popular choice of pet . Organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide , and many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures are selected by breeders . The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean groups , especially as a food source , but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies . The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains , where they are known as cuy . A modern breeding program was started in the 1960s in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as cuy mejorados ( improved cuy ) and prompted efforts to increase consumption of the animal outside South America . Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century . The animals were so frequently used as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject .",
