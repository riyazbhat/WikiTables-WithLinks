In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) .

During the early 2000s the company borrowed substantially to fund mortgages , with the aim of ambitious growth , and also donated large amounts to charitable purposes and communities directly and through sponsorships . The global banking crisis beginning around 2007-08 meant that it was unable to produce income as expected from its loans , and was at risk of being unable to repay the amounts it had borrowed . The news that the bank had approached the government for support with its liquidity led within 24 hours to a public lack of confidence and concerns that savings were at risk , and the bank failed following a bank run as people rushed to withdraw their savings . It was the first British bank in 150 years to fail due to a bank run . Unable to find a commercial buyer or secure the further government support needed , it was taken into public ownership in 2008 , as an alternative to insolvency . By that point the government had extended liquidity support of tens of billions of pounds to Northern Rock . An inquiry concluded that the board had failed to properly protect the bank from the risks inherent in its strategy , or to restrain the executive directors where required , therefore although the bank had sufficient assets , it had become vulnerable . The branch operations were eventually returned to private ownership when the branches and other retail operations were acquired by Virgin Group in 2012 , being rebranded as Virgin Money the same year .

  "/wiki/Danish_krone": "The krone ( Danish pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u02b0\u0281o\u02d0n\u0259 ] ; plural : kroner ; sign : kr . ; code : DKK ) is the official currency of Denmark , Greenland , and the Faroe Islands , introduced on 1 January 1875 . Both the ISO code DKK and currency sign kr . are in common use ; the former precedes the value , the latter in some contexts follows it . The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish crown in English , since krone literally means crown . Historically , krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century . One krone is subdivided into 100 \u00f8re ( Danish pronunciation : [ \u02c8\u00f8\u02d0\u0250 ] ; singular and plural ) , the name \u00f8re is probably derived from the Roman word for gold . Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone , with the smallest being the 50 \u00f8re coin ( one half of a krone ) . Formerly there were more \u00f8re coins , but those were discontinued due to inflation . The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II , the European Union 's exchange rate mechanism . Adoption of the euro is favoured by some of the major political parties , however a 2000 referendum on joining the Eurozone was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone .",
