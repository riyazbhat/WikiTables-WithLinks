  "/wiki/Crying": "Crying is the shedding of tears ( or welling of tears in the eyes ) in response to an emotional state , pain or a physical irritation of the eye . Emotions that can lead to crying include anger , happiness , or sadness . The act of crying has been defined as a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus , without any irritation of the ocular structures , instead , giving a relief which protects from conjunctivitis . A related medical term is lacrimation , which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears . Various forms of crying are known as sobbing , weeping , wailing , whimpering , bawling , and blubbering . For crying to be described as sobbing , it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms , such as slow but erratic inhalation , occasional instances of breath holding and muscular tremor . A neuronal connection between the lacrimal gland ( tear duct ) and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established . Scientists debate over whether humans are the only animals that produce tears in response to emotional states . Charles Darwin wrote in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals that the keepers of Indian elephants in the London Zoo told him that their charges shed tears in sorrow . Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears . They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones prolactin , adrenocorticotropic hormone , and Leu-enkephalin , and the elements potassium and manganese .",

This can result in mental illness , Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , irregular heartbeat , an impaired immune response , liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk , among other diseases .

  "/wiki/Promiscuity": "Promiscuity is the practice of engaging in sexual activity frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners . The term can carry a moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships . A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand , and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity . What sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures , as does the prevalence of promiscuity . Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statutes . Feminists have traditionally argued a significant double standard exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity . Historically , stereotypes of the promiscuous woman have tended to be pejorative , such as the slut or the harlot , while male stereotypes have been more varied , some expressing approval , such as the stud or the player , while others imply societal deviance , such as the womanizer or the philanderer . A scientific study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are both prone to derogatory judgment . Promiscuity is common in many animal species . Some species have promiscuous mating systems , ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event . Many species form stable pair bonds , but still mate with other individuals outside the pair . In biology , incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called extra-pair copulations .",
