  "/wiki/Electronic_music": "Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments , digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology . In general , a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means ( electroacoustic music ) , and that produced using electronics only . Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements , such as strings , hammers , and so on , and electric elements , such as magnetic pickups , power amplifiers and loudspeakers . Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium , Hammond organ , and the electric guitar , which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet . Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings , hammers , or other sound-producing mechanisms . Devices such as the theremin , synthesizer , and computer can produce electronic sounds . The first electronic devices for performing music were developed at the end of the 19th century , and shortly afterward Italian futurists explored sounds that had not been considered musical . During the 1920s and 1930s , electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions for electronic instruments were made . By the 1940s , magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction , leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s , in Egypt and France . Musique concr\u00e8te , created in Paris in 1948 , was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds . Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 . Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s",
  "/wiki/Funk": "Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , psychedelic rock , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer , often at slower tempos than other popular music . Like much of African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that created a hypnotic and danceable feel . Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat - with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure ( The One ) , and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines , drum patterns , and guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly and the Family Stone , The Meters , and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . Notable funk women include Chaka Khan , Marva Whitney , Lyn Collins , Brides of Funkenstein , Vicki Anderson , Anna King ( The JB 's singer ) , and Parlet . Funk derivatives include the psychedelic funk of Sly Stone and George Clinton ; the avant-funk of groups such as Talking Heads and the Pop Group ; boogie , a form of post-disco dance music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour , Faith No More ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam . Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and various forms of electronic dance music , such as house music , and Detroit techno . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk",
  "/wiki/Soul_music": "Soul music ( often referred to simply as soul ) is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s . It combines elements of African-American gospel music , rhythm and blues and jazz . Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States , where record labels such as Motown , Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement . Soul also became popular around the world , directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa . According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky , secular testifying . Catchy rhythms , stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves , are an important feature of soul music . Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound . The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions , twirls and auxiliary sounds . Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture . The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music , which boasted pride in being black . Soul music dominated the U.S. R & B chart in the 1960s , and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. , Britain and elsewhere . By 1968 , the soul music genre had begun to splinter",
  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation",
  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s",

  "/wiki/Trombone": "The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family . As on all brass instruments , sound is produced when the player 's vibrating lips ( embouchure ) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate . Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch . Many modern trombone models also use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument . Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet . The word trombone derives from Italian tromba ( trumpet ) and -one ( a suffix meaning large ) , so the name means large trumpet . The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart , the baritone , in contrast to its conical valved counterparts : the cornet , the euphonium , and the French horn . The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone . The most common variant , the tenor , is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d , an octave below the B\u266d trumpet and an octave above the pedal B\u266d tuba . The once common E\u266d alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor , but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works . Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef , although exceptions do occur , notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B\u266d transposing instrument , written in treble clef . A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player",

  "/wiki/Pop_music": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern forms in the US and the UK during the mid-1950s . The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks",

  "/wiki/French_horn": "The French horn ( since the 1930s known simply as the horn in some professional music circles ) is a brass instrument made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell . The double horn in F/B\u266d ( technically a variety of German horn ) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands . A musician who plays a French horn is known as a horn player or hornist . Pitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors : speed of air through the instrument ( controlled by the player 's lungs and thoracic diaphragm ) ; diameter and tension of lip aperture ( by the player 's lip muscles - the embouchure ) in the mouthpiece ; plus , in a modern French horn , the operation of valves by the left hand , which route the air into extra sections of tubing . Most horns have lever-operated rotary valves , but some , especially older horns , use piston valves ( similar to a trumpet 's ) and the Vienna horn uses double-piston valves , or pumpenvalves . The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations , in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet . A horn without valves is known as a natural horn , changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument ( similar to a bugle ) . Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell , in effect reducing the bell 's diameter . The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell . The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different crooks of different lengths . Three valves control the flow of air in the single horn , which is tuned to F or less commonly B\u266d . The more common double horn has a fourth , trigger valve , usually operated by the thumb , which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B\u266d which expands the horn range to over four octaves and blends with flutes or clarinets in a woodwind ensemble",

  "/wiki/Brass_instrument": "A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player 's lips . Brass instruments are also called labrosones , literally meaning lip-vibrated instruments . There are several factors involved in producing different pitches on a brass instrument . Slides , valves , crooks ( though they are rarely used today ) , or keys are used to change vibratory length of tubing , thus changing the available harmonic series , while the player 's embouchure , lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series . The view of most scholars ( see organology ) is that the term brass instrument should be defined by the way the sound is made , as above , and not by whether the instrument is actually made of brass . Thus one finds brass instruments made of wood , like the alphorn , the cornett , the serpent and the didgeridoo , while some woodwind instruments are made of brass , like the saxophone",

  "/wiki/The_Beau_Brummels": "The Beau Brummels were an American rock band . Formed in San Francisco in 1964 , the band 's original lineup included Sal Valentino ( lead vocals ) , Ron Elliott ( lead guitar ) , Ron Meagher ( bass guitar ) , Declan Mulligan ( rhythm guitar , bass , harmonica ) , and John Petersen ( drums ) . They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label , Autumn Records , where Sylvester Stewart - later known as Sly Stone - produced the group 's early recording sessions . Initially , the band 's musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to the Beatles , while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock . The Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single , Laugh , Laugh , for which they would later be credited for setting one of the aesthetic foundations for the San Francisco Sound , along with other bands such as the Charlatans ; the song is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll . The band 's popularity continued with the subsequent album , 1965 's Introducing The Beau Brummels , and the Top 10 single Just a Little . The group 's commercial success declined by the following year , at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records . After recording an album of cover songs , Beau Brummels '66 , the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums : Triangle in 1967 and Bradley 's Barn in 1968 . The band underwent several personnel changes , beginning with Mulligan 's departure in 1965 . Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition , leaving him unable to tour with the band . Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66 , Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces . Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre , reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle",
