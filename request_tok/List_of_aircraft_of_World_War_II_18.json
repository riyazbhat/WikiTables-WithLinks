  "/wiki/Ambrosini_S.7": "The Ambrosini SAI.7 was an Italian racing aircraft flown before World War II that entered production as a military trainer ( designated simply S.7 ) after the war . It was of conventional configuration , constructed of wood , with a tail wheel undercarriage . Power was provided by an air-cooled inverted inline engine , the Alfa-Romeo model 115 with 225 horsepower .",
  "/wiki/Ambrosini_SAI.10_Grifone": "The Ambrosini SAI.10 Grifone ( Griffon ) was a military trainer aircraft produced in small numbers for the Italian Regia Aeronautica early in World War II . With the approach of war , the Ministero dell ' Aeronautica began a programme to increase the number of pilots available , and ordered a prototype primary trainer from Ambrosini . This aircraft , a parasol monoplane of mixed construction , first flew on July 8 1939 with Guiliano Ferrari at the controls . A production batch of 50 was ordered , but this was quickly reduced to just 10 machines , all of which were delivered in 1940 . Production aircraft differed by having a Fiat A.50 radial engine in place of the prototype 's CNA D. Other engine fits that were trialled included an example with a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 , and one with an Alfa Romeo 110 ; this latter machine designated SAI.11 . Another experimental development that did not enter production was a float-equipped SAI.10 Gabbiano ( Seagull ) .",
  "/wiki/Arado_Ar_65": "The Arado Ar 65 was the single-seat biplane fighter successor to the Ar 64 . Both looked very similar . The only major difference was the use of a 12-cylinder inline engine versus the Ar 64 's radial . The wingspan was also increased . The Ar 65 appeared in 1931 and six models were built . The first three 65a-c were prototypes , while the 65d-f were production models . The Ar 65d was delivered in 1933 and served alongside the Ar 64 in the two fighter groups - Fliegergruppe D\u00f6beritz and Fliegergruppe Damm . In 1935 , the Ar 65 was reduced to a training aircraft . Production of the fighter was discontinued in 1936 . However , the next year , 12 of them were presented to Germany 's ally - the Royal Bulgarian Air Force . The final production total was 85 aircraft .",

  "/wiki/CAC_Wirraway": "The CAC Wirraway ( an Aboriginal word meaning challenge ) was a training and general purpose military aircraft manufactured in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation ( CAC ) between 1939 and 1946 . It was an Australian development of the North American NA-16 training aircraft . The Wirraway has been credited as being the foundation of Australian aircraft manufacturing . During the Second World War , both Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) deployed a number of Wirraways into combat roles , where they served in a makeshift light bomber/ground attack capacity , striking against the advancing forces of the Empire of Japan . While the type had been primarily used as a trainer and general purpose aircraft , being present in small quantities within the majority of front-line squadrons for these purposes ; the aircraft was often pressed into combat when required . Typically , fighter versions of the Wirraway were operated over theatres such as New Guinea to perform ground attack missions and other Army co-operation tasks over extended periods until more advanced aircraft had become available in sufficient quantities . On 12 December 1942 , the Wirraway achieved its only shoot-down of an enemy aircraft - thought to be a Mitsubishi A6M Zero at the time , but later determined to be a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa - while flown by Pilot Officer John S. Jack Archer . Following the end of the conflict , the Wirraway was operated for over a decade as a trainer by the RAAF , the newly formed RAN Fleet Air Arm , and the squadrons of the Citizen Air Force . During 1957 , the last of the RAN 's Wirraways was retired , having been replaced by the newer jet-powered de Havilland Vampire ; as the CAC Winjeel came into squadron service , the RAAF phasing out its remaining fleet of Wirraways during the late 1950s . Officially , the last military flight to be performed by the type was conducted on 27 April 1959 . Notably , the Wirraway had also functioned as the starting point for the design of a wartime emergency fighter , which was also developed and manufactured by CAC , known as the Boomerang .",
  "/wiki/Caproni_Ca.113": "The Caproni Ca.113 was an advanced training biplane produced in Italy and Bulgaria in the early 1930s . Designed as a follow-on to the Ca.100 , it was a more powerful and robust aircraft capable of aerobatics . It was a conventional design with two cockpits in tandem , single-bay staggered wings of equal span , and mainwheels covered by large spats .",
  "/wiki/Caudron_C.690": "The Caudron C.690 was single-seat training aircraft developed in France in the late 1930s to train fighter pilots to handle high-performance aircraft . It was a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane that bore a strong resemblance to designer Marcel Riffard 's racer designs of the same period . Caudron attempted to attract overseas sales for the aircraft , but this resulted in orders for only two machines - one from Japan , and the other from the USSR . In the meantime , the first of two prototypes was destroyed in a crash that killed Ren\u00e9 Paulhan , Caudron 's chief test pilot . Despite this , the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air eventually showed interest in the type , and ordered a batch of a slightly refined design . The first of these was not delivered until April 1939 , and only 15 C.690Ms were supplied before the outbreak of war .",

  "/wiki/Hawker_Hart": "The Hawker Hart was a British two-seater biplane light bomber aircraft of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . It was designed during the 1920s by Sydney Camm and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft . The Hart was a prominent British aircraft in the inter-war period , but was obsolete and already side-lined for newer monoplane aircraft designs by the start of the Second World War , playing only minor roles in the conflict before being retired . Several major variants of the Hart were developed , including a navalised version for the Royal Navy 's aircraft carriers . Beyond Britain , the Hart would be operated by a number of foreign nations , including Sweden , Yugoslavia , Estonia , South Africa , and Canada .",

It was a singular aircraft , being obsolescent as a fighter when it first appeared in 1934 , but despite this it was used as such until 1940 . The Luftwaffe showed an interest in it as a trainer , even though German first line fighters were completely different . The Ro.41 is almost unknown , compared to many other Italian aircraft , despite being one of the most numerous produced , in its 16-year career .",

  "/wiki/Miles_Master": "The Miles M.9 Master was a British two-seat monoplane advanced trainer designed and built by aviation company Miles Aircraft Ltd . It was inducted in large numbers into both the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) during the Second World War . The Master can trace its origins back to the earlier M.9 Kestrel demonstrator aircraft . Following the failure of the rival de Havilland Don as a satisfactory trainer aircraft , the RAF ordered 500 M9A Master advancer trainers to meet its needs . Once in service , it provided a fast , strong and fully aerobatic aircraft that functioned as an excellent introduction to the high performance British fighter aircraft of the day : the Spitfire and Hurricane . Throughout its production life , thousands of aircraft and various variants of the Master were produced , the latter being largely influenced by engine availability . Numerous Masters were modified to enable their use as glider tows . The Master also served as the basis for the Miles Martinet , a dedicated target tug adopted by the RAF . Perhaps the most radical use of the aircraft was the M.24 Master Fighter . Armed with six .303 in machine guns , it was intended to function as an emergency fighter during the Battle of Britain ; this model did not ultimately see combat . Ordinary trainer models could also be fitted with armaments , including a single .303 in Vickers machine gun and eight bombs , albeit intended for training purposes only . Beyond the British air services , other nations also chose to adopt the Master , including the South African Air Force , United States Army Air Force ( USAAF ) , Irish Air Corps , Royal Egyptian Air Force , Turkish Air Force , and the Portuguese Air Force ."
