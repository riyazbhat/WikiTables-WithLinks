  "/wiki/12_Metre": "The 12 Metre class is a rating class for racing sailboats that are designed to the International rule . It enables fair competition between boats that rate in the class whilst retaining the freedom to experiment with the details of their designs . The designation 12 Metre does not refer to any single measurement on the boat , and is not referencing the vessels overall length , rather , measures the sum of the components directed by the formula which governs design and construction parameters . Typically 12 Metre class boats range from 65 to 75 feet ( about 20 to 23 m ) in length overall ; they are most often sloop-rigged , with masts roughly 85 feet ( 26 m ) tall . The first 12 Metres were built in 1907 . The 12 Metre class was used in the Olympic Games of 1908 , 1912 and 1920 but few boats participated in these events . The 12 Metre class boats are best known as the boat design used in the America 's Cup from 1958 to 1987 . Competitiveness between boats in the class is maintained by requiring the boats to be in compliance with the 12 Metre formula . Designers and builders are required to take into account such things as the sail area , the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth ( the measurement around the boat from one sideboard , under the keel , and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side ) . The measurements are then weighted in the formula . For example , the present formula takes the square root of the sail area rather than total area . The combination of weighted measurements must be less than or equal to 12 metres",
  "/wiki/International_rule_(sailing)": "The International rule , also known as the Metre rule , was created for the measuring and rating of yachts to allow different designs of yacht to race together under a handicap system . Prior to the ratification of the International rule in 1907 , countries raced yachts under their own national rules and international competition was always subject to various forms of subjective handicapping",
  "/wiki/15-metre_class": "The IYRU Fifteen Metre class yachts are constructed to the First International rule of 1907 . A total of twenty 15mR yachts were built between 1907 and 1917 , the four that have survived are still actively raced",

Eight metre in class name does not , somewhat confusingly , refer to length of the boat , but product of the formula . 8mR boats are on average some 15 metres long .
