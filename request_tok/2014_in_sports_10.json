  "/wiki/Formula_One": "Formula One ( also known as Formula 1 or F1 ) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) and owned by the Formula One Group . The World Drivers ' Championship , which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981 , has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 . The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres . Traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008 .",
  "/wiki/2014_United_States_Grand_Prix": "The 2014 United States Grand Prix ( formally the 2014 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix ) was a Formula One motor race held on 2 November at the Circuit of the Americas in Travis County near Austin , Texas . It was the 17th round of the 2014 Formula One season and the 36th running of the event held as part of the Formula One World Championship . The 56-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton after starting from second position . His teammate Nico Rosberg finished second and Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo came in third . It was Hamilton 's tenth victory of the season , his second at Austin , and the 32nd of his career . Rosberg won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage on the first lap . The race was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car on the same lap when Sergio P\u00e9rez made contact with Adrian Sutil and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen , and remained out for a further three laps . During the first period of the race , Hamilton ran close behind teammate Rosberg to conserve fuel but braked heavily through portions of the track to prevent brake glazing . After the two Mercedes cars made their pit stops for tyre changes , Hamilton drew closer to Rosberg , passed him for the lead of the race on lap 24 , and pulled away from his teammate . He remained the leader after the second round of pit stops to win . In the week running up to the Grand Prix , the Caterham and Marussia teams went into administration and were granted dispensation to miss the race , leaving the sport with only nine entered teams , the lowest number since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix . Hamilton 's victory , his fifth consecutive of the season , enabled him to pull further clear from Rosberg at the top of the Drivers ' Championship , with Ricciardo 's third-place finish rendering him unable to challenge for the title .",

[ note 3 ] Born and raised in Stevenage , Hertfordshire , Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 . This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007 , making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport . [ note 4 ] That season , Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point . The following season , he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion - making a crucial overtake on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season - to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history . After four more years with McLaren without finishing higher than fourth in the drivers ' standings , Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013 , reuniting with his childhood karting teammate , Nico Rosberg . Changes to regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines contributed to the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton , during which he has won five further World Championship titles . Hamilton won consecutive titles in 2014 and 2015 during an intense and sometimes volatile rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg , to match his hero Ayrton Senna 's three World Championships .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s .
