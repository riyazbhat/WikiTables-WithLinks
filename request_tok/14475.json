  "/wiki/THX": "THX Ltd. is an American company founded in 1983 by George Lucas and it is headquartered in San Francisco , California . It develops the THX high fidelity audio/visual reproduction standards for movie theaters , screening rooms , home theaters , computer speakers , gaming consoles , car audio systems , and video games . THX Ltd. is a subsidiary of Razer Inc . The current THX was created on June 12 , 2002 when it spun off from Lucasfilm Ltd. THX was developed by Tomlinson Holman at George Lucas 's company , Lucasfilm , in 1983 to ensure that the soundtrack for the third Star Wars film , Return of the Jedi , would be accurately reproduced in the best venues . THX was named after Holman , with the X standing for crossover or experiment as well as in homage to Lucas 's first film , THX 1138 . The distinctive glissando up from a rumbling low pitch used in the THX trailers , created by Holman 's coworker James A. Moorer , is known as the Deep Note . The THX system is not a recording technology and it does not specify a sound recording format : all sound formats , whether digital ( Dolby Digital , DTS , SDDS ) or analog ( Dolby Stereo , Ultra Stereo ) , can be shown in THX . THX is a quality assurance system . THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality , predictable playback environment to ensure that any film soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer . THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard . Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements ; architectural requirements include a floating floor , baffled and acoustically treated walls , non-parallel walls ( to reduce standing waves ) , a perforated screen ( to allow center channel continuity ) , and NC30 rating for background noise ( ensures noise from air conditioning units and projection equipment does not mask the subtle effects in a movie 's soundtrack ) . In 2002 , THX was owned by sound card manufacturer Creative Technology Limited , which held a 60 % share of the company .",
