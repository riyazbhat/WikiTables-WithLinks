The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization .

Napier88 was ahead of its time in many ways , and was the first robustly implemented language to combine a polymorphic type system with orthogonal persistence . The language was robustly implemented and released to users from both industry and academia ; up to 1,000 registered users were recorded in due course . The language , however , was only intended to provide a proof of concept for an experiment in persistent programming ; some time after 1989 ( the year the first implementation was in fact released ) the group 's interests moved on and the language was no longer maintained . Its influence lives on in various other systems however ; the CORBA type ANY is distinctly recognisable in Napier88 's type ANY ; Microsoft 's Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) uses a similar polymorphic architecture , and Java 's parametric types solve some of the same problems of uninstantiated types escaping from their static scope .",

Developed to be suitable for teaching , research and industrial application , Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features . Type classes , for example , enable type-safe operator overloading , were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott for Standard ML and were first implemented in Haskell . Haskell 's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler . It is named after logician Haskell Curry . Haskell 's semantics are historically based on those of the Miranda programming language , which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group . The last formal specification of the language was made in July 2010 , while the development of GHC 's implementation has continued to extend Haskell via language extensions . The next formal specification is planned for 2020 . Haskell is used in academia and industry . As of September 2019 , Haskell was the 23rd most popular programming language in terms of Google searches for tutorials and made up less than 1% of active users on the GitHub source code repository .",

  "/wiki/TypeScript": "TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft . It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript , and adds optional static typing to the language . TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript . As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript , existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs . TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution ( as with Node.js or Deno ) . There are multiple options available for transcompilation . Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used , or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript . TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries , much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files . This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities . There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery , MongoDB , and D3.js . TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available , allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript . The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript .",

  "/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)": "Lisp ( historically LISP ) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive , fully parenthesized prefix notation . Originally specified in 1958 , Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today . Only Fortran is older , by one year . Lisp has changed since its early days , and many dialects have existed over its history . Today , the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Clojure , Common Lisp , and Scheme . Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs , influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church 's lambda calculus . It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence ( AI ) research . As one of the earliest programming languages , Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science , including tree data structures , automatic storage management , dynamic typing , conditionals , higher-order functions , recursion , the self-hosting compiler , and the read-eval-print loop . The name LISP derives from LISt Processor . Linked lists are one of Lisp 's major data structures , and Lisp source code is made of lists . Thus , Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure , giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp . The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax .",

Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs .

PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification .
