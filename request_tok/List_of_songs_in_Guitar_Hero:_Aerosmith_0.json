The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat , and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 ( as a result of constant fighting between the brothers ) . Their third single , the Ray Davies-penned You Really Got Me , became an international hit , topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States . Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres , including rhythm and blues , American rock and roll , British music hall , folk , and country .

  "/wiki/Guitar": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings . It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand , while simultaneously fretting ( pressing the strings against the frets ) with the fingers of the other hand . The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically , by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar ( for an acoustic guitar ) , or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker . The guitar is a type of chordophone , traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning . The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four-course Renaissance guitar , and the five-course baroque guitar , all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument . There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar : the classical guitar ( Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar ) , the steel-string acoustic guitar , and the archtop guitar , which is sometimes called a jazz guitar . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings ' vibration , amplified by the hollow body of the guitar , which acts as a resonating chamber . The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player 's fingers , as opposed to being strummed . The term finger-picking can also refer to a specific tradition of folk , blues , bluegrass , and country guitar playing in the United States . The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar . Electric guitars , introduced in the 1930s , use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear , and , given that it produces an electric signal when played , that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer ( e.g. , bass and treble tone controls ) and a huge variety of electronic effects units , the most commonly used ones being distortion ( or overdrive ) and reverb . Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body , but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s , as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback howls .",
