The opera was orchestrated for strings only . Demetrio e Polibio was Rossini 's first attempt at a full-scale opera , assembled piecemeal during his student days at the Philharmonic Academy of Bologna in 1806 . Because it was commissioned by tenor Domenico Mombelli ( whose wife wrote the libretto ) and was performed privately by Mombelli and his two daughters , a performance which Rossini did not attend , it was not his first fully staged opera . The opera was not professionally staged until 18 May 1812 , when it premiered at Rome 's Teatro Valle .",

  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
  "/wiki/Teatro_Valle": "The Teatro Valle ( literally Valley Theater ) is a theatre and former opera house in Rome , Italy . Commissioned by the Capranica family , the architect Tommaso Morelli designed the theatre which was built in 1726 . It was inaugurated with the staging of the tragedy Matilde by Simon Falconio Pratoli . After hosting a season of opera seria in 1730 , the Valle was limited through much of the latter half of the 18th century to staging prose dramas as well as a mix of intermezzos and comic operas , particularly those of Galuppi , Piccinni , Anfossi , Sacchini , Paisiello , Guglielmi , and Cimarosa . It was the only theatre in Rome in 1782 , and after 1786 , which offered both spring and autumn seasons of opera as well a season during Carnival . Throughout the early 19th century , the Valle was regularly staging opera buffa and opera semiseria as well as prose comedies and , increasingly after 1830 , serious melodramas . A number of operas during this time were premiered at the Valle , including Rossinis Demetrio e Polibio ( 1812 ) , Torvaldo e Dorliska ( 1815 ) , and La Cenerentola ( 1817 ) ; Mercadantes Il geloso ravveduto ( 1820 ) ; Donizettis L'ajo nell'imbarazzo ( 1824 ) , Olivo e Pasquale ( 1827 ) , Il furioso allisola di San Domingo ( 1833 ) , and Torquato Tasso ( 1833 ) ; Pacinis La giovent\u00f9 di Enrico V ( 1820 ) ; and Luigi Riccis Lorfana di Ginevra ( 1829 ) , Il sonnambulo ( 1829 ) , and Chi dura vince ( 1834 ) , as well as many lesser known works from local composers . Beginning from the middle of the 19th century , the Teatro Valle has staged only spoken drama . Pirandello 's Six Characters in Search of an Author had its world premiere in the theatre in 1921 . The seating in the Teatro Valle initially consisted of five tiers of 27 boxes . It underwent renovation in by Mauro Fontana in 1765 and was restored again in 1791 . The theatre was rebuilt in 1821 to the design of Valadier , completed by Salvi and in 1845 a fa\u00e7ade designed by Gaspare Servi was added .",

  "/wiki/Farsa": "Farsa ( Italian , literally : farce , plural : farse ) is a genre of opera , associated with Venice in the late 18th and early 19th centuries .

Many of the recorded productions were at the Teatro San Mois\u00e8 in Venice , often during Carnival . Musically they may have derived from the two-act dramma giocoso , although there were other influences , including the French com\u00e9die m\u00eal\u00e9e d'ariettes . Few of the original 18th-century farse are now performed . The German composer Johann Simon Mayr , who lived in Northern Italy , wrote about 30 farse . Rossini wrote five examples : La cambiale di matrimonio ( 1810 ) , L'inganno felice ( 1812 ) , La scala di seta ( 1812 ) , Il Signor Bruschino ( 1813 ) , and Adina ( 1818 ) .

He was educated at Turin , and showed an early fondness for literature , especially for the theatre . The praise he received for his early attempts made him persevere this choice of career , and he obtained engagements with several companies both as writer and actor . He made a happy marriage in 1777 , and soon afterwards left the stage and devoted himself entirely to writing . He settled at Padua , and the reputation of his numerous comedies rapidly spread in Italy , for a time eclipsing that of his predecessors . Most of his plays were melodramas , and his work became repetitive , but he caught something of the new spirit appearing in German dramatic literature , in the works of Schiller , Iffland and Kotzebue . When his financial success came to an end , he found a helpful friend in a wealthy merchant of Padua , Francis Barisan , for whose private theatre he wrote many pieces . In 1791 he became dangerously ill and was unable to work for several years . His works , in the absence of any copyright law , were published by others without his permission . In 1802 , he undertook to prepare a collected edition ; but of this four volumes only were completed when he was again taken ill , and died at Padua .",

It is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges . The islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon , an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers ( more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile ) . In 2018 , 260,897 people resided in the Comune di Venezia , of whom around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice ( centro storico ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , which is considered a statistical metropolitan area , with a total population of 2.6 million . The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for a millennium and more , from 697 to 1797 . It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as an important center of commerce - especially silk , grain , and spice , and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th . The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial center , emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence .

The term is a contraction of dramma giocoso per musica and describes the opera 's libretto ( text ) . The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition , mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice . A dramma giocoso characteristically used a grand buffo ( comic or farce ) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act . Goldoni 's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales , followed by a short third act . Composers Baldassare Galuppi , Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni , and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni 's texts to music . The only operas of this genre that are still frequently staged are Gioachino Rossini 's L'italiana in Algeri ( 1813 ) and La Cenerentola ( 1817 ) , and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte 's Don Giovanni ( 1787 ) and Cos\u00ec fan tutte ( 1790 ) .

The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813 , and because Il signor Bruschino premiered in late January , the composer must have completed Tancredi in less than a month . The overture , borrowed from La pietra del paragone , is a popular example of Rossini 's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded . Considered by Stendhal , Rossini 's earliest biographer , to be high amongst the composer 's masterworks , and describing it as a genuine thunderbolt out of a clear , blue sky for the Italian lyric theatre , his librettist Gaetano Rossi notes that , with it , Rossini rose to glory . Richard Osborne proclaims it to be his fully fledged opera seria and it established him , more of less instantly , as Italy 's leading composer of contemporary opera . Although the original version had a happy ending ( as required by the opera seria tradition ) , soon after the Venice premiere , Rossini - who was more of a Neo-classicist than a Romantic , notes Servadio - had the poet Luigi Lechi rework the libretto to emulate the original tragic ending by Voltaire . In this new ending , presented at the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara on 21 March 1813 , Tancredi wins the battle but is mortally wounded , and only then does he learn that Amenaide never betrayed him . Argirio marries the lovers in time for Tancredi to die in his wife 's arms .

However , the third fire was the result of arson . It destroyed the house in 1996 leaving only the exterior walls , but it was rebuilt and re-opened in November 2004 . In order to celebrate this event the tradition of the Venice New Year 's Concert started .",

It has been suggested that the latter name may have resulted from a confusion of Romani with Luigi Romanelli , La Scala 's house poet prior to Romani 's appointment to the post . The story was based on the libretto by Gaetano Sertor for Pasquale Anfossi 's 1789 opera Zenobia in Palmira and it centers on the rivalry between the Roman Emperor Aurelian and Prince Arsace of Persia over the beautiful Zenobia , Queen of Palmyra . The Act 1 duet between Zenobia and Arsace , Se tu m'ami , o mia regina ( If you love me , oh my queen ) , was greatly admired by Stendhal . Although he had never seen a complete performance of Aureliano in Palmira , he heard the duet in a concert in Paris and described its music as sublime and one of the best duets that Rossini had written .

It was premiered at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on 4 October 1815 and was the first of nine operas which Rossini wrote for the San Carlo . Altogether , this was one of eighteen operas which he wrote during the time he spent in Naples . Rossini took melodies from other operas to compose Elisabetta , including the overture , first written for Aureliano in Palmira , which is famous as the overture to The Barber of Seville . As Holden notes , with the re-uses of earlier music , it is as if Rossini wished to present himself to the Neapolitan public by offering a selection of the best music from operas unlikely to have been revived in Naples .

The city was an important part of Magna Graecia , played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society and a significant cultural centre under the Romans . It served as the capital of the Duchy of Naples ( 661-1139 ) , then of the Kingdom of Naples ( 1282-1816 ) and finally of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861 . Naples is also considered a capital of the Baroque since the arrival of Caravaggio in the 17th century , and due to the artistic revolution his arrival occasioned . Between 1925 and 1936 , Naples was expanded and upgraded by Benito Mussolini 's government but subsequently sustained severe damage from Allied bombing during World War II , which led to extensive post-1945 reconstruction work . Naples has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades , helped by the construction of the Centro Direzionale business district and an advanced transportation network , which includes the Alta Velocit\u00e0 high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno and an expanded subway network .

It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as commedia in musica , commedia per musica , dramma bernesco , dramma comico , divertimento giocoso . Especially associated with developments in Naples in the first half of the 18th century , whence its popularity spread to Rome and northern Italy , buffa was at first characterized by everyday settings , local dialects , and simple vocal writing ( the basso buffo is the associated voice type ) , the main requirement being clear diction and facility with patter . The New Grove Dictionary of Opera considers La Cilla ( music by Michelangelo Faggioli , text by Francesco Antonio Tullio [ it ] , 1706 ) and Luigi and Federico Ricci 's Crispino e la comare ( 1850 ) to be the first and last appearances of the genre , although the term is still occasionally applied to newer work ( for example Ernst Krenek 's Zeitoper Schwergewicht ) . High points in this history are the 80 or so libretti by Carlindo Grolo , Loran Glodici , Sogol Cardoni and various other approximate anagrams of Carlo Goldoni , the three Mozart/Da Ponte collaborations , and the comedies of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti . Similar foreign genres such as op\u00e9ra comique or Singspiel differed as well in having spoken dialogue in place of recitativo secco , although one of the most influential examples , Pergolesi 's La serva padrona ( which is an intermezzo , not opera buffa ) , sparked the querelle des bouffons in Paris as an adaptation without sung recitatives .",

The plot of the libretto differs greatly from Shakespeare 's play in that it takes place wholly in Venice , not mainly on Cyprus , and the dramatic conflict develops in a different manner . The role of Iago is much less diabolical than Shakespeare 's play or Verdi 's 1887 opera Otello , which was based on it . Shakespeare derived his play from the story Un Capitano Moro ( A Moorish Captain ) by Cinthio , a disciple of Boccaccio , first published in 1565.In further contrast , the role of Roderigo , a sub-plot in Shakespeare and Verdi , is very prominent in Rossini 's version - some of the most difficult and brilliant music being assigned to the character Rodrigo . The roles of Otello , Iago , and Rodrigo are all composed for the tenor voice . Rossini 's Otello is an important milestone in the development of opera as musical drama . It provided Giuseppe Verdi with a benchmark for his own adaptations of Shakespeare .

La Cenerentola , which he completed in a period of three weeks , is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles .

  "/wiki/Cinderella": "Cinderella , or The Little Glass Slipper , is a folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression and triumphant reward .

The Chinese story of Ye Xian , first attested in a source from around 860 AD , is another early variant of the story . The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634 ; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9 in 1697 . Another version was later published by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms ' Fairy Tales in 1812 . Although the story 's title and main character 's name change in different languages , in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name . The word Cinderella has , by analogy , come to mean one whose attributes were unrecognized- one who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect .
