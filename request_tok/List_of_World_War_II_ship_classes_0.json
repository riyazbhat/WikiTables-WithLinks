  "/wiki/250t-class_torpedo_boat": "The 250t class were high-seas torpedo boats built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1913 and 1916 . A total of 27 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies , with the letter after the boat number indicating the manufacturer . There were small variations between manufacturers , mainly in the steam turbines used , and whether they had one or two funnels . The eight boats of the T-group , designated 74 T - 81 T , were built by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino , located at Trieste . The sixteen boats of the F-group , 82 F - 97 F , were built by Ganz-Danubius at their shipyards at Fiume and Porto Re . The three M-group boats , 98 M - 100 M , were manufactured by Cantiere Navale Triestino at Monfalcone . All 27 boats saw service in World War I , undertaking anti-submarine operations in the Adriatic Sea , shore bombardment missions along its Italian coastline , and convoy , escort and minesweeping tasks . Although widely used during the war , the class suffered no losses , despite taking hits during surface engagements and damage from accidents . In 1917 , one of the 66 mm ( 2.6 in ) guns on each boat was placed on an anti-aircraft mount . Under the terms of the post-war Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye , the boats were transferred to various countries , including seven to Romania , six to Portugal , six to Greece , and eight to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) . By 1940 , thirteen boats of the class had been lost or scrapped , including all six Portuguese boats . During World War II , the five remaining Greek boats were sunk by Axis aircraft during the German-led invasion of Greece in April 1941",
  "/wiki/Torpedo_boat": "A torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval ship designed to carry torpedoes into battle . The first designs rammed enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes , and later designs launched self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes . They were created to counter battleships and other slow and heavily armed ships by using speed , agility , and the power of their torpedo weapons . A number of inexpensive torpedo boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship 's ability to fight them off using its large but cumbersome guns . An inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could pose a threat to much larger and more expensive fleets of capital ships , albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them . The introduction of fast torpedo boats in the late 19th century was a serious concern to the era 's naval strategists . In response , navies operating large ships introduced smaller ships to counter torpedo boats , mounting light quick-firing guns . These ships , which came to be called torpedo boat destroyers and later simply destroyers , became larger and took on more roles , making torpedo attacks as well as defending against them , and eventually defending against submarines and aircraft . The destroyer eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the guided missile age . In the modern era , the old concept of a very small , fast , and cheap surface combatant with powerful offensive weapons is taken up by the fast attack craft",

  "/wiki/German_World_War_II_destroyers": "At the outbreak of the Second World War Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine had 21 destroyers ( Ger : Zerst\u00f6rer ) in service , while another one was just being completed . These 22 vessels - comprising 3 classes ( Type 34 , 34A and 36 ) - had all been built in the 1930s , making them modern vessels ( no destroyers remained in German hands following the close of the First World War ) . [ note 1 ] Including that final pre-war vessel , a further 19 were brought into service during the war and more were captured from opposing navies , including the Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) after the Italian Armistice with the Allies in 1943 . German destroyer classes were generally known by the year of their design . Because of their size , use and weaponry , some vessels classified as fleet torpedo boats , Flottentorpedoboot , are also described . During World War II , destroyers were administratively grouped into one of several destroyer flotillas . Class general characteristics are taken from the first of each class , and may differ slightly for individual ships , particularly when they were refitted . Post-war , some surviving ships had significant changes to armament",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340 %",

It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels",

The Norwegian government purchased four submarines that were almost completed in 1913 and received three of these before World War I . The fourth , A-5 , was seized by German authorities at the outbreak of war and commissioned as SM UA . It was used for coastal protection and from 1916 as a training vessel in the Baltic Sea",
  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage",

Before World War I , mine ships were termed mine planters generally . For example , in an address to the United States Navy ships of Mine Squadron One at Portland , England Admiral Sims used the term mine layer while the introduction speaks of the men assembled from the mine planters . During and after that war the term mine planter became particularly associated with defensive coastal fortifications . The term minelayer was applied to vessels deploying both defensive- and offensive mine barrages and large scale sea mining . Minelayer lasted well past the last common use of mine planter in the late 1940s . An army 's special-purpose combat engineering vehicles used to lay landmines are sometimes called minelayers",

By the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America . After the 1893 naval rebellion , there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905 , when Brazil acquired two of the most powerful and advanced dreadnoughts of the day which sparked a dreadnought race with Brazil 's South American neighbours .

Bl\u00fccher was sunk by Norwegian coastal defenses outside Oslo while Admiral Hipper led the attack on Trondheim . She then conducted sorties into the Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping . In 1942 , she was deployed to northern Norway to attack shipping to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 , where she was damaged by British cruisers . Prinz Eugen saw her first action during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung with the battleship Bismarck . She eventually returned to Germany during the Channel Dash in 1942 , after which she too went to Norway . After being torpedoed by a British submarine , she returned to Germany for repairs",
  "/wiki/Heavy_cruiser": "The heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser , a naval warship designed for long range and high speed , armed generally with naval guns of roughly 203 mm ( 8 inches ) in caliber , whose design parameters were dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930 . The heavy cruiser is part of a lineage of ship design from 1915 through the early 1950s , although the term heavy cruiser only came into formal use in 1930 . The heavy cruiser 's immediate precursors were the light cruiser designs of the 1900s and 1910s , rather than the armoured cruisers of the years before 1905 . When the armoured cruiser was supplanted by the battlecruiser , an intermediate ship type between this and the light cruiser was found to be needed - one larger and more powerful than the light cruisers of a potential enemy but not as large and expensive as the battlecruiser so as to be built in sufficient numbers to protect merchant ships and serve in a number of combat theaters . With their intended targets being other cruisers and smaller vessels , the role of the heavy cruiser differed fundamentally from that of the armored cruiser . Also , the heavy cruiser was designed to take advantage of advances in naval technology and design . Typically powered by oil-fired steam turbines rather than the reciprocating steam engines of the armoured cruiser , heavy cruisers were capable of far faster speeds and could cruise at high speed for much longer than could an armoured cruiser . They used uniform main guns , mounted in center-line superfiring turrets rather than casemates . Casemate guns and a mixed battery were eliminated to make room for above deck torpedoes , and ever increasing and more effective anti-aircraft armaments . They also benefited from the superior fire control of the 1920s and continually upgraded through the 1950s . Late in the development cycle radar and electronic countermeasure would also appear and rapidly gain in importance . These developments meant that the heavy cruiser was an overall more powerful ship type than the armoured cruiser had been",
  "/wiki/Admiralty_type_flotilla_leader": "The Admiralty type leader , sometimes known as the Scott class , were a class of eight destroyer leaders designed and built for the Royal Navy towards the end of World War I . They were named after Scottish historical leaders . The function of a leader was to carry the flag staff of a destroyer flotilla , therefore they were enlarged to carry additional crew , offices and signalling equipment , allowing a fifth gun to be carried . These ships were very similar to the Thornycroft type leader , but the latter had broad , slab-sided funnels characteristic of Thornycroft designs , the Admiralty type having two narrow funnels of equal height . All except Mackay and Malcolm were completed in time for wartime service , Scott being a war loss . The two final orders - Barrington and Hughes - were cancelled with the end of the War ; these two had originally been ordered to the Thornycroft leader design . Stuart was transferred to Australia in 1933 . All the remaining ships except Bruce ( expended as a target ship in 1939 ) survived service in World War II , being converted to escort ships . Montrose and Stuart had Brown-Curtis steam turbines , giving 43,000 shp ( 32,000 kW ) for an extra \u00bd knot",
  "/wiki/Flotilla_leader": "A flotilla leader was a warship of late 19th century and early 20th century navies suitable for commanding a flotilla of destroyers or other small warships , typically a small cruiser or a large destroyer ( known as a destroyer leader ) . The flotilla leader provided space , equipment and staff for the flotilla commodore ( who typically held the rank of captain ) , including a wireless room , senior engineering and gunnery officers , and administrative staff to support the officers . Originally , older light or scout cruisers were often used , but in the early 1900s , the rapidly increasing speed of new destroyer designs meant that such vessels could no longer keep pace with their charges . Accordingly , large destroyer designs were produced for use as leaders . As destroyers changed from specialized anti-torpedo boat vessels that operated in squadrons to larger multi-purpose ships that operated alone or as leaders of groups of smaller vessels , and as command and control techniques improved ( and the technology became more readily available ) , the need for specialized flotilla leaders decreased and their functions were adopted by all destroyers . The last specialized flotilla leader to be built for the Royal Navy was HMS Inglefield , launched in 1936 . Subsequent leaders used the same design as the private ships of the class , with minor detailed changes to suit them to their role . In the Royal Navy , the flotilla leader and commanding officer were known as Captain ( D ) . In the Royal Navy , flotilla leaders and divisional leaders could be identified by particular coloured bands painted on their funnels",
