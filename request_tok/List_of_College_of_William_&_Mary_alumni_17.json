  "/wiki/Continental_Congress": "The Continental Congress was initially a convention of delegates from a number of British American colonies at the height of the American Revolution , who acted collectively for the people of the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately became the United States of America . After declaring the colonies independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776 , it acted as the provisional governing structure for the collective United States , while most government functions remained in the individual states . The term most specifically refers to the First Continental Congress of 1774 and the Second Continental Congress of 1775-1781 . More broadly , it also refers to the Congress of the Confederation of 1781-1789 , thus covering the three congressional bodies of the Thirteen Colonies and the United States that met between 1774 and the inauguration of a new government in 1789 under the United States Constitution . Convened in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1774 , the First Continental Congress sought to help repair the frayed relationship between the British government and its American colonies while also asserting the rights of colonists . The Second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 , proclaiming that the 13 colonies were now independent sovereign states , no longer under British rule . This body functioned as the provisional government for the U.S. until the nation 's first Frame of Government , the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , came into force on March 1 , 1781 , at which time it became the Congress of the Confederation . Officially styled The United States in Congress Assembled , this unicameral governing body would convene in eight sessions ( a ninth would fail to achieve a quorum ) prior to being disbanded in 1789 , when the 1st United States Congress under the new constitution took over the role as the nation 's legislative branch of government . Much of what is known today about the daily activities of these congresses comes from the journals kept by the secretary for all three congresses , Charles Thomson . Printed contemporaneously , the Papers of the Continental Congress contain the official congressional papers , letters , treaties , reports and records . The delegates to the Continental and Confederation congresses had extensive experience in deliberative bodies , with a cumulative total of nearly 500 years of experience in their Colonial assemblies , and fully a dozen of them had served as speakers of the houses of their legislatures .",

With the creation of the House of Burgesses in 1642 , the General Assembly , which had been established in 1619 , became a bicameral institution . From 1642 to 1776 , the House of Burgesses was an instrument of government alongside the royally-appointed colonial governor and the upper-house Council of State in the General Assembly . When the Virginia colony declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain at the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776 and became the independent Commonwealth of Virginia , the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates , which continues to serve as the lower house of the General Assembly .",
  "/wiki/Stamp_Act": "A stamp act is any legislation that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents . Those who pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents , making them legal documents . A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including playing cards , dice , patent medicines , cheques , mortgages , contracts , marriage licenses and newspapers . The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty , although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common . This system of taxation was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax . Stamp acts have been enforced in many countries , including Australia , Canada , People 's Republic of China , Ireland , India , Malaysia , Israel , the United Kingdom , and the United States of America . The taxes raised under a stamp act are called stamp duty .",

  "/wiki/Restored_government_of_Virginia": "The Restored ( or Reorganized ) Government of Virginia was the Unionist government of Virginia during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) in opposition to the government which had approved Virginia 's seceding from the United States and joining the new Confederate States of America . Each government regarded the other as illegitimate ; the Restored Government had de facto control of the state 's northwest until , with its approval , the area became West Virginia in mid-1863 . Thereafter , the Restored Government was in large part a government in exile , with most of its de jure territory under the secessionist state government or martial law . The Restored Government had only executive and legislative branches ; it did not form a judicial branch . The Restored Government met in Wheeling , in the extreme northwestern corner of the state , until that became West Virginia . From August 26 , 1863 until June 1865 , it met in Alexandria on the northeast edge of the state , which had been occupied by Union Army forces in 1861 to protect the adjacent national capital of Washington , D.C .

The Lee Resolution for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes . The Committee of Five had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence . John Adams , a leader in pushing for independence , had persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which Congress edited to produce the final version . The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . Adams wrote to his wife Abigail , The Second Day of July 1776 , will be the most memorable Epocha , in the History of America - although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4 , the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved .
