  "/wiki/Folk_high_school": "Folk high schools ( Danish : Folkeh\u00f8jskole ; Dutch : Volkshogeschool ; Finnish : kansanopisto and ty\u00f6v\u00e4enopisto or kansalaisopisto ; German : Volkshochschule and ( a few ) Heimvolkshochschule ; Norwegian : Folkeh\u00f8gskole ( NB ) /Folkeh\u00f8gskule ( NN ) ; Swedish : Folkh\u00f6gskola ; Hungarian : n\u00e9pf\u0151iskola ) are institutions for adult education that generally do not grant academic degrees , though certain courses might exist leading to that goal . They are most commonly found in Nordic countries and in Germany , Switzerland and Austria . The concept originally came from the Danish writer , poet , philosopher , and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig ( 1783-1872 ) . Grundtvig was inspired by the Marquis de Condorcet 's Report on the General Organization of Public Instruction which was written in 1792 during the French Revolution . The revolution had a direct influence on popular education in France . In the United States , a Danish folk school called Danebod was founded in Tyler , Minnesota . Despite similar names and somewhat similar goals , the institutions in Germany and Sweden are quite different from those in Denmark and Norway . Folk high schools in Germany and Sweden are in fact much closer to the institutions known as folkeuniversitet in Norway and Denmark , which provide adult education . However , unlike the folkeuniversitet folk high schools in Sweden are not connected with a regular university . The Finnish adult education centers called ty\u00f6v\u00e4enopisto and kansalaisopisto ( Swedish : arbetarinstitut , literally workers ' institute ) are also part of the adult education tradition . Other countries have also been inspired by Grundtvig 's concept of popular education . In Nigeria , the United States , and India , a few schools have been built upon Grundtvig 's principles for education .",
