  "/wiki/Cruiserweight_boxing": "Cruiserweight , also referred to as junior heavyweight , is a weight class in professional boxing between light heavyweight and heavyweight . Before the advent of the current cruiserweight class , light heavyweight and cruiserweight were sometimes used interchangeably in the United Kingdom . The current weight limit for the division is 200 pounds ( 14 stone 4 pounds / 90.7 kg ) . When originally established , the weight limit was 190 pounds ( 13st . 8 lbs . / 86.2 kg ) . The division was established in order to accommodate smaller heavyweight boxers who could not compete with the growing size of boxers in that division . While many great heavyweight champions ( such as Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis ) weighed around 190 pounds in their career , during the 1970s it became fairly standard that fit heavyweight boxers weighed at least 210 pounds . It was felt by many boxing authorities that asking men weighing between 176 and 190 pounds to fight these larger men was unfair . The WBC was the first boxing organization to recognize the cruiserweight division when it sanctioned a bout between Marvin Camel and Mate Parlov on December 8 , 1979 , for their version of the title . That fight was a draw , but in the rematch in March 1980 Camel won and became the first cruiserweight champion . In 1982 the World Boxing Association recognized Ossie Ocasio as their first cruiserweight champion when he defeated South African Robbie Williams ( although at that time the WBA called the division junior heavyweight ) .",
