Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions , with distances beginning with 50 meters ( 50 yards ) and reaching 1500 meters ( 1650 yards ) , also known as the mile . The term 'freestyle stroke ' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl ' , as front crawl is the fastest swimming stroke . It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions .",

The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition . [ fn 4 ] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa . Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

  "/wiki/Breaststroke": "Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on their chest and the torso does not rotate . It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer 's head being out of the water a large portion of the time , and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds . In most swimming classes , beginners learn either the breaststroke or the freestyle ( front crawl ) first . However , at the competitive level , swimming breaststroke at speed requires comparable endurance and strength to other strokes . Some people refer to breaststroke as the frog stroke , as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water . The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest of all swimming strokes .",

It is the newest swimming style swum in competition , first swum in 1933 and originating out of the breaststroke .",
