  "/wiki/Stormers": "The Stormers ( known for sponsorship reasons as the DHL Stormers ) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Cape Town in the Western Cape , competing in the Super Rugby competition . They have never won a tournament , but their home stadium , Newlands , typically draws the highest average attendance figures of any ground in Super Rugby . [ citation needed ] They are centred on the Western Province Currie Cup side , but also draw players from the Boland Cavaliers ( covering the Cape Winelands and West Coast districts , with home matches in Wellington ) . Through 2005 , they also drew players from the SWD Eagles ( George ) , which meant that they drew players from all three unions in the Western Cape Province . However , the general realignment of franchise areas resulting from the expansion of the competition resulted in the Eagles being moved to the area of the Southern Spears ( later succeeded by the Southern Kings ) . Prior to 1998 , South Africa did not use a franchise system for the Super 12 , instead sending the top four unions from its domestic competition , the Currie Cup , into the Super 12 . In 1996 , the Stormers qualified and competed in the Super 12 as Western Province . In 1997 , they did not qualify , the 4th South African team being the Orange Free State ( now the Free State Cheetahs at Currie Cup level ; the region would later be represented in Super 12 by the Cats ( now known as the Lions ) and in Super 14 by the Cheetahs ) . The Stormers played their first ever final , against the Bulls in front of 36,000 fans in Johannesburg , in 2010 after beating the Waratahs in the semi-final stage but ultimately lost to the Bulls . In the two previous years in which they reached the semi-finals , 1999 and 2004 , they were eliminated by the Highlanders and Crusaders . They made consecutive home semifinals in 2011 and 2012 , but lost both at Newlands to the Crusaders and the Sharks respectively .
