It is located at the confluence of the Nive and Adour rivers in the northern part of the cultural region of the Basque Country , as well as the southern part of Gascony where the Aquitaine basin joins the beginning of the Pre-Pyrenees . Together with nearby Anglet , Biarritz , Saint-Jean-de-Luz , and several smaller communes , Bayonne forms an urban area with 288,359 inhabitants at the 2012 census , 45,855 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper . The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before ancient times as a fortified enclosure was attested in the 1st century at the time when the Tarbelli occupied the territory . Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman castrum , a stronghold in Novempopulania at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the Vascones . In 1023 Bayonne was the capital of Labourd and , in the 12th century , extended to and beyond the Nive . At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour . The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine : it became militarily and , above all , commercially important thanks to maritime trade . It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by Richard the Lion Heart . In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the Hundred Years ' War . The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it . The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the Spanish expulsions dictated by the Alhambra Decree .",
