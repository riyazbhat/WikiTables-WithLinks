  "/wiki/Headphones": "Headphones ( or head-phones in the early days of telephony and radio ) traditionally refer to a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user 's ears . They are electroacoustic transducers , which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound . Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately , in contrast to a loudspeaker , which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear . Headphones are also known as earspeakers , earphones or , colloquially , cans . Circumaural ( 'around the ear ' ) and supra-aural ( 'over the ear ' ) headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place . Another type , known as earbuds or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user 's ear canal . A third type are bone conduction headphones , which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal , leaving the ear canal open . In the context of telecommunication , a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone . Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier , radio , CD player , portable media player , mobile phone , video game console , or electronic musical instrument , either directly using a cord , or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth , DECT or FM radio . The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators , to keep their hands free . Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones . Headphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities",

  "/wiki/Model_theory": "In mathematics , model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures ( e.g . groups , fields , graphs , universes of set theory ) from the perspective of mathematical logic . The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language . A set of sentences in a formal language is one of the components that form a theory . A model of a theory is a structure ( e.g . an interpretation ) that satisfies the sentences of that theory . Model theory recognizes and is intimately concerned with a duality : it examines semantical elements ( meaning and truth ) by means of syntactical elements ( formulas and proofs ) of a corresponding language : in a summary definition , dating from 1973 ,",

He was one of the most prolific mathematicians and producers of mathematical conjectures of the 20th century . He was known both for his social practice of mathematics ( he engaged more than 500 collaborators ) and for his eccentric lifestyle ( Time magazine called him The Oddball 's Oddball ) . He devoted his waking hours to mathematics , even into his later years - indeed , his death came only hours after he solved a geometry problem at a conference in Warsaw . Erd\u0151s pursued and proposed problems in discrete mathematics , graph theory , number theory , mathematical analysis , approximation theory , set theory , and probability theory . Much of his work centered around discrete mathematics , cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field . He championed and contributed to Ramsey theory , which studies the conditions in which order necessarily appears . Overall , his work leaned towards solving previously open problems , rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics . Erd\u0151s published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime , a figure that remains unsurpassed . He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity , living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians . Erd\u0151s 's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erd\u0151s number , the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erd\u0151s in terms of co-authorships",
