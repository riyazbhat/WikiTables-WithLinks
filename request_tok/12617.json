  "/wiki/Psychology": "Psychology is the science of behavior and mind . Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena , as well as feeling and thought . It is an academic discipline of immense scope . Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains , and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties , joining this way the broader neuroscientific group of researchers . As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases . In this field , a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social , behavioral , or cognitive scientist . Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior , while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors . Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes , including perception , cognition , attention , emotion , intelligence , subjective experiences , motivation , brain functioning , and personality . This extends to interaction between people , such as interpersonal relationships , including psychological resilience , family resilience , and other areas . Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind . Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables . In addition , or in opposition , to employing empirical and deductive methods , some - especially clinical and counseling psychologists - at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques .",
