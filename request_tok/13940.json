  "/wiki/Boucan_d'enfer": "Boucan d'enfer is a studio album from French artist Renaud . It was released in 2002 and published by Virgin Records . It was Renaud 's first production with original material since 1994 's \u00c0 la belle de mai . It marked Renaud 's comeback to the musical scene after years of alcoholism . Some of the songs thus refer to this period , especially the first track , Docteur Renaud , Mister Renard which opposes the good and the bad sides of the past and present Renaud in an obvious parody of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde . The track was released as a single and proved a minor success hitting number 25 on the French charts . His separation from his wife is also very present in the lyrics , but the usual social themes have n't been left out either . Petit p\u00e9d\u00e9 is the story of a homosexual who left his country town after his coming out . But the song Manhattan-Kaboul , a duet with Belgian Axelle Red , became the most recognised song of the album , and one of Renaud 's biggest hits ( the single spent five months in the French top twenty with two weeks at number 2 ) . In Manhattan-Kaboul Renaud talks about a Puerto Rican immigrant worker who died in the 9/11 attack , while Axelle Red tells the story of a young Afghan girl who died when the US-led coalition attacked her country in retaliation . Corsic'armes focuses on nationalism in Corsica , the song being dedicated to 'Christel ' ( Christelle ) , the widow of assassinated nationalist Fran\u00e7ois Santoni . Some of the album 's songs have more humorous tones , for example Baltique , which is about Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 's dog , who was n't allowed to attend his master 's funeral .",
