Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria , the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew . For a country attempting to rebuild its shattered economy and reputation after World War II , Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride . Of all Italy 's ships at the time , Andrea Doria was the largest , fastest and supposedly safest . Launched on 16 June 1951 , the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953 . On 25 July 1956 , while Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket , Massachusetts , bound for New York City , the eastbound MS Stockholm of the Swedish American Line collided with her in one of history 's most infamous maritime disasters . Struck in the side , the top-heavy Andrea Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard , which left half of its lifeboats unusable . The consequent shortage of lifeboats could have resulted in significant loss of life , but the ship stayed afloat for over 11 hours after the collision . The calm , appropriate behavior of the crew , together with improvements in communications , and the rapid response of other ships , averted a disaster similar in scale to that of Titanic in 1912 . While 1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived , 46 people on the ship died as a direct consequence of the collision . The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning . This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of SS Eastland in 1915",

Why Antilles\u2032 captain decided to sail into the narrow , shallow strait is still not known . But on hitting the rocks the impact ruptured a fuel tank and she caught fire . All of her passengers and crew evacuated the ship safely to the island of Mustique and they were rescued by the Cunard Line\u2032s Queen Elizabeth 2 .
