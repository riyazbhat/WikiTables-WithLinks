  "/wiki/Historical_buildings_and_structures_of_Zion_National_Park": "The historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park represent a variety of buildings , interpretive structures , signs and infrastructure associated with the National Park Service 's operations in Zion National Park , Utah . Structures vary in size and scale from the Zion Lodge to road culverts and curbs , nearly all of which were designed using native materials and regional construction techniques in an adapted version of the National Park Service Rustic style . A number of the larger structures were designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood , while many of the smaller structures were designed or coordinated with the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs . The bulk of the historic structures date to the 1920s and 1930s . Most of the structures of the 1930s were built using Civilian Conservation Corps labor . The version of the National Park Service Rustic style that was adopted at Zion was less extreme in its rustic character than that employed at other parks . Compared with the Bryce Canyon Lodge , the Zion Park Lodge used smaller elements of timber and stonework , and employed milled lumber in place of rough log elements . This reflected the more settled character of the Zion area , which retained farms and irrigation systems at the time the first visitor facilities were built . Many of Zion 's historical structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) , either as individual structures or as contributing structures in a historic district . They represent an unusually homogeneous series of buildings for a national park , sharing details of composition , scale and materials . They have collectively been described as some the best work in the National Park Service Rustic style . ( The NRHP-listed structures are also listed in alphabetical order in National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park . )",

  "/wiki/Zion_National_Park": "Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale . A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile ( 590 km2 ) park is Zion Canyon , which is 15 miles ( 24 km ) long and up to 2,640 ft ( 800 m ) deep . The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River . The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft ( 1,117 m ) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft ( 2,660 m ) at Horse Ranch Mountain . Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau , Great Basin , and Mojave Desert regions , the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity . Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds , 75 mammals ( including 19 species of bat ) , and 32 reptiles inhabit the park 's four life zones : desert , riparian , woodland , and coniferous forest . Zion National Park includes mountains , canyons , buttes , mesas , monoliths , rivers , slot canyons , and natural arches . Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans , one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi ( c. 300 CE ) . Subsequently , the Virgin Anasazi culture ( c. 500 ) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities . Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes . Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s . In 1909 , President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon .",
