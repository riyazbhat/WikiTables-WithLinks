  "/wiki/Electric_power": "Electric Power is the rate , per unit time , at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit . The SI unit of power is the watt , one joule per second . Electric power is usually produced by electric generators , but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries . It is usually supplied to businesses and homes ( as domestic mains electricity ) by the electric power industry through an electric power grid . Electric energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour ( 1 kW\u00b7h = 3.6 MJ ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours . Electric utilities measure energy using an electricity meter , which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer . Electric power can be delivered over long distances by transmission lines and used for applications such as motion , light or heat with high efficiency .",
  "/wiki/Turbines": "A turbine ( from the Latin turbo , a vortex , related to the Greek \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b2\u03b7 , tyrb\u0113 , meaning turbulence ) is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work . The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator . A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly , which is a shaft or drum with blades attached . Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor . Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels . Gas , steam , and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid . Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer Sir Charles Parsons ( 1854-1931 ) for invention of the reaction turbine , and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval ( 1845-1913 ) for invention of the impulse turbine . Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit , typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery . The word turbine was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo , or vortex , in a memo , Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires \u00e0 grande vitesse , which he submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences in Paris . Benoit Fourneyron , a former student of Claude Burdin , built the first practical water turbine .",
  "/wiki/Bagasse": "Bagasse ( /b\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u00e6s/ b\u0259-GAS-se ' ) is the dry pulpy fibrous residue that remains after sugarcane or sorghum stalks are crushed to extract their juice . It is used as a biofuel for the production of heat , energy , and electricity , and in the manufacture of pulp and building materials . Agave bagasse is a similar material that consists of the tissue of the blue agave after extraction of the sap .",

  "/wiki/Coffee_grounds": "Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage . While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials , the process includes four basic steps : raw coffee beans must be roasted , the roasted coffee beans must then be ground , the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time ( brewed ) , and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds . Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking . In most areas , coffee may be purchased unprocessed , or already roasted , or already roasted and ground . Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life .",
  "/wiki/Sawdust": "Sawdust ( or wood shavings ) is a by-product or waste product of woodworking operations such as sawing , milling , planing , routing , drilling and sanding .

  "/wiki/Biofuels": "A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass , rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels , such as oil . Since biomass technically can be used as a fuel directly ( e.g . wood logs ) , some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably . More often than not however , the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of , or some form of thermally/chemically altered solid end product , like torrefied pellets or briquettes . The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels , used for transportation . The EIA ( U.S. Energy Information Administration ) follow this naming practice . If the biomass used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly , the fuel is generally considered to be a form of renewable energy ."
