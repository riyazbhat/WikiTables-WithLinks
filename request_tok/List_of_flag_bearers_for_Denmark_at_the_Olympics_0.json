  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

  "/wiki/Curling": "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet toward the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones , with each player throwing two . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends . The player can induce a curved path , described as curl , by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides . The path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms or brushes , who accompany it as it slides down the sheet and sweep the ice in front of the stone . Sweeping a rock decreases the friction , which makes the stone travel a straighter path ( with less curl ) and a longer distance . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result . This gives curling its nickname of chess on ice .",

  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 .

  "/wiki/Sailing": "Sailing employs the wind - acting on sails , wingsails or kites - to propel a craft on the surface of the water ( sailing ship , sailboat , windsurfer , or kitesurfer ) , on ice ( iceboat ) or on land ( land yacht ) over a chosen course , which is often part of a larger plan of navigation . A course defined with respect to the true wind direction is called a point of sail . Conventional sailing craft can not derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind . On a given point of sail , the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction ( as perceived on the craft ) to mobilize the power of the wind . The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull , keel , and rudder of a sailing craft , by forces from skate runners of an iceboat , or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course . In the 21st century , most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport . Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising . Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips , coastal sailing within sight of land , and daysailing . Until the mid of the 19th century , sailing ships were the primary means for marine commerce , this period is known as Age of Sail .",

  "/wiki/Badminton": "Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net . Although it may be played with larger teams , the most common forms of the game are singles ( with one player per side ) and doubles ( with two players per side ) . Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach ; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court . Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side 's half of the court . Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net . Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire , service judge , or ( in their absence ) the opposing side . The shuttlecock is a feathered or ( in informal matches ) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports . In particular , the feathers create much higher drag , causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly . Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports . The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature . The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock . European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia , with recent competitions dominated by China .",

  "/wiki/Figure_skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice .

The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward ( classic style ) or side-to-side in a skating motion ( skate skiing ) , aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow . It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes , including Northern Europe , Canada , Russia , the United States , Australia and New Zealand .

Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits .
