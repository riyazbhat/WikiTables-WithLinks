  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",
  "/wiki/M3_GMC": "The M3 Gun Motor Carriage ( GMC ) was a United States Army tank destroyer equipped with a 75 mm M1897A4 gun , which was built by the Autocar Company during World War II . After observing the new and often decisive , uses of armored vehicles on both sides during the French campaign of 1940 , the US Army decided that it required a 75 mm self-propelled gun , based on the chassis of the M3 Half-track . This was initially known as the T12 . However , after the addition of features such as the gun shield from the M2A3 ( a carriage for the M1897A4 ) , the new vehicle entered production under the name M3 Gun Motor Carriage ( or M3 GMC ) . Because the number of M2A3 gun shields available was insufficient for the M3 GMC order , a new gun shield was designed . Variants featuring the new shield were designated M3A1 GMC . The T12/M3 first served in the Philippines Campaign in 1942 with the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade in the anti-tank and the fire-support role . It then served in North Africa in tank destroyer battalions . It was used ineffectively in the Battle of Kasserine Pass and several other engagements , but was used with success in the Battle of El Guettar . It also served in the Allied invasion of Sicily , but was eventually superseded by the M10 tank destroyer . A total of 2,203 were produced , of which 1,361 were converted back into M3A1 half-tracks . The M3 GMC also served in the Pacific theater , starting with the Battle of Saipan .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour .

  "/wiki/Birch_gun": "The Birch Gun was the world 's first practical self-propelled artillery gun , built at the Royal Arsenal , Woolwich in 1925 . Despite proving itself a practical proposition the Birch Gun was never highly regarded by the British High Command , apparently not for any particular defect or lack of capability but an entrenched belief that such an innovation was unprecedented and so at best unwelcome and at worst an expensive and unnecessary indulgence . Named after General Sir Noel Birch , who was Master General of Ordnance at the time , the Birch gun comprised a Vickers Medium Mark II tank chassis originally fitted with a QF 18 pdr ( 83.8 mm ) . This remained the armament in all the models , although the latest version , usually called the Mk III , had limited elevation . Birch Guns were used in the Experimental Mechanised Force manoeuvres of 1928 but by 1931 they had all been removed from service and political pressure was applied to prevent any plans to complete the third version of this weapon . It would be a decade before the British Army returned to the concept of tracked artillery , in the middle years of a war for national survival where speed and mobility on the battlefield were not optional , and eleven years before it would once again be equipped with a similarly effective weapon .",

  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies .

Its chassis was engineered to be mine-resistant and blastproof , allowing it to survive multiple TM-46 detonations during trials . The G6 was conceived as a wheeled rather than a tracked vehicle for this purpose , as well as to allow it to deploy long distances by road without consuming excessive quantities of fuel or requiring a tank transporter . G6s entered service during the last two years of the South African Border War , frequently shelling positions held by the People 's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola ( FAPLA ) during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale . Their ability to bombard a target and change positions rapidly in less than two minutes , with minimal preparation , greatly reduced the threat posed by retaliatory Angolan air raids and counter-battery fire . A number of G6s were subsequently manufactured for export and purchased by Abu Dhabi and Oman . Export models included a specialist anti-aircraft variant with a GEC-Marconi Marksman turret and twin-barrelled 35mm autocannon . Chile briefly produced the G6 under licence as the CC-SP-45 , although this arrangement was later terminated after the system was not adopted by that country 's armed forces .",
  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",
  "/wiki/Contemporary_history": "Contemporary history , in English-language historiography , is a subset of modern history which describes the historical period from approximately 1945 to the present . Contemporary history is either a subset of the late modern period , or it is one of the three major subsets of modern history , alongside the early modern period and the late modern period . The term contemporary history has been in use at least since the early 19th century . Contemporary history is politically dominated by the Cold War ( 1945-91 ) between the United States and Soviet Union whose effects were felt across the world . The confrontation , which was mainly fought through proxy wars and through intervention in the internal politics of smaller nations , ultimately ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact in 1991 , following the Revolutions of 1989 . The latter stages and aftermath of the Cold War enabled the democratisation of much of Europe , Africa , and Latin America . In the Middle East , the period after 1945 was dominated by conflict involving the new state of Israel and the rise of petroleum politics , as well as the growth of Islamism after the 1980s . The first supranational organisations of government , such as the United Nations and European Union , emerged during the period after 1945 , while the European colonial empires in Africa and Asia collapsed , gone by 1975 . Countercultures rose and the sexual revolution transformed social relations in western countries between the 1960s and 1980s , epitomised by the Protests of 1968 . Living standards rose sharply across the developed world because of the post-war economic boom , whereby such major economies as Japan and West Germany emerged . The culture of the United States , especially consumerism , spread widely . By the 1960s , many western countries had begun deindustrializing ; in their place , globalization led to the emergence of new industrial centres , such as Japan , Taiwan and later China , which exported consumer goods to developed countries .",
  "/wiki/Non-Line-of-Sight_Cannon": "The Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles ( MGV ) was a family of lighter and more transportable ground vehicles developed by BAE Systems Inc and General Dynamics as part of the United States Army 's Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) program . The ground vehicles were to be based on a common tracked vehicle chassis . The MGV program was superseded by the Ground Combat Vehicle which has also been cancelled .",
  "/wiki/Future_Combat_Systems": "Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) was the United States Army 's principal modernization program from 2003 to early 2009 . Formally launched in 2003 , FCS was envisioned to create new brigades equipped with new manned and unmanned vehicles linked by an unprecedented fast and flexible battlefield network . The U.S. Army claimed it was their most ambitious and far-reaching modernization program since World War II . Between 1995 and 2009 , $ 32 billion was expended on programs such as this , with little to show for it . In April and May 2009 , Pentagon and army officials announced that the FCS vehicle-development effort would be cancelled . The rest of the FCS effort would be swept into a new , pan-army program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program ."
