Symptoms are repeated , brief periods of vertigo with movement , that is , of a spinning sensation upon changes in the position of the head . This can occur with turning in bed or changing position . Each episode of vertigo typically lasts less than one minute . Nausea is commonly associated . BPPV is one of the most common causes of vertigo . BPPV can result from a head injury or simply occur among those who are older . A specific cause is often not found . The underlying mechanism involves a small calcified otolith moving around loose in the inner ear . It is a type of balance disorder along with labyrinthitis and M\u00e9ni\u00e8re 's disease . Diagnosis is typically made when the Dix-Hallpike test results in nystagmus ( a specific movement pattern of the eyes ) and other possible causes have been ruled out . In typical cases , medical imaging is not needed .",

He invented the first perfusion pump with Charles A. Lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation . His positive description of an allegedly miraculous healing he witnessed during a pilgrimage earned him scorn of some of his colleagues . This prompted him to relocate to the United States , where he lived most of his life . He had a leading role in implementing eugenic policies in Vichy France . A Nobel Prize laureate in 1912 , Alexis Carrel was also elected twice , in 1924 and 1927 , as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR .",

He was born in London as the youngest of 8 children to a family of steel merchants from Leeds . As a school boy he did water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst . He studied chemistry at the University of Leeds with Julius B. Cohen and after he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg he joined Columbia University in 1905 , working in the lab of Christian Herter . During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds . In 1905 , he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory ( see : History of catecholamine research ) . In 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort . Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute , Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne . There they developed the Carrel-Dakin method of wound treatments . This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin 's solution , a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite ( the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products ) and boric acid . In the process , he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances , and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing . The solution is still widely used for that purpose , as of 2013 .",

  "/wiki/Digital_object_identifier": "In computing , a digital object identifier ( DOI ) is a persistent identifier or handle used to identify objects uniquely , standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) . An implementation of the Handle System , DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic , professional , and government information , such as journal articles , research reports and data sets , and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources , such as commercial videos . A DOI aims to be resolvable , usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers . This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object , such as a URL , indicating where the object can be found . Thus , by being actionable and interoperable , a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to identify their referents uniquely . The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata . The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document , whereas its location and other metadata may change . Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL . But every time a URL changes , the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL . It is the publisher 's responsibility to update the DOI database . If they fail to do so , the DOI resolves to a dead link leaving the DOI useless . The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation ( IDF ) , which introduced it in 2000 .",

  "/wiki/Emergency_medicine": "Emergency medicine , also known as accident and emergency medicine , is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention . Emergency physicians care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages . As first-line providers , their primary responsibility is to initiate resuscitation and stabilization and to start investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase . Emergency physicians generally practise in hospital emergency departments , pre-hospital settings via emergency medical services , and intensive care units , but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics . Sub-specializations of emergency medicine include disaster medicine , medical toxicology , ultrasonography , critical care medicine , hyperbaric medicine , sports medicine , palliative care , or aerospace medicine . Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally . In countries following the Anglo-American model , emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons , general practitioners , and other generalist physicians , but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts , and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners . By contrast , in countries following the Franco-German model , the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists ( for critical resuscitation ) , surgeons , specialists in internal medicine , pediatricians , cardiologists or neurologists as appropriate . In developing countries , emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited .",
  "/wiki/Choking": "Choking occurs when breathing is impeded by a constricted or obstructed throat or windpipe . In some cases the air flow is completely blocked , in other cases some amount of air can pass to the lungs . Insufficient oxygen being delivered to the body will result in oxygen deprivation . Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops , this sequence of events can lead to death . Choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the US in 2011 . Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young ( children under 1 years old ) and in the elderly ( adults over 75 years ) . Obstruction of the airway can occur at the level of the pharynx or the trachea . Foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx ( such as bananas , marshmallows , or gelatinous candies ) can be a danger not just for children but for persons of any age . Choking is one type of airway obstruction , which includes any blockage of the air-conducting passages , including blockage due to tumors , swelling of the airway tissues , and compression of the laryngopharynx , larynx or vertebrate trachea in strangulation .",

Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination . Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted . On occasion , neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used . Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , edited and used by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , published by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) . The fifth edition of the DSM ( DSM-5 ) was published in 2013 which re-organized the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current research . The combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice , but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities , e.g. , assertive community treatment , community reinforcement , and supported employment . Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis , depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question .

The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms . People often have more than one anxiety disorder . The cause of anxiety disorders is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Risk factors include a history of child abuse , family history of mental disorders , and poverty . Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders , particularly major depressive disorder , personality disorder , and substance use disorder . To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present for at least 6 months , be more than what would be expected for the situation , and decrease functioning . Other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism ; heart disease ; caffeine , alcohol , or cannabis use ; and withdrawal from certain drugs , among others . Without treatment , anxiety disorders tend to remain .",

  "/wiki/Appendicitis": "Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix . Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and decreased appetite . However , approximately 40 % of people do not have these typical symptoms . Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread , painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis . Appendicitis is caused by a blockage of the hollow portion of the appendix . This is most commonly due to a calcified stone made of feces . Inflamed lymphoid tissue from a viral infection , parasites , gallstone , or tumors may also cause the blockage . This blockage leads to increased pressures in the appendix , decreased blood flow to the tissues of the appendix , and bacterial growth inside the appendix causing inflammation . The combination of inflammation , reduced blood flow to the appendix and distention of the appendix causes tissue injury and tissue death . If this process is left untreated , the appendix may burst , releasing bacteria into the abdominal cavity , leading to increased complications . The diagnosis of appendicitis is largely based on the person 's signs and symptoms . In cases where the diagnosis is unclear , close observation , medical imaging , and laboratory tests can be helpful .",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Meister": "Joseph Meister ( 21 February 1876 - 24 June 1940 ) was the first person to be inoculated against rabies by Louis Pasteur , and the first person to be successfully treated for the infection . In 1885 , nine-year-old Meister was badly bitten by a rabid dog . After consulting with Alfred Vulpian and Jacques-Joseph Grancher and obtaining their assistance , Louis Pasteur agreed to inoculate the boy with spinal tissue from rabid rabbits , which he had successfully used to prevent rabies in dogs . The treatment was successful and the boy did not develop rabies . As an adult , Meister served as a caretaker at the Pasteur Institute until his death in 1940 at age 64 . On 24 June 1940 , ten days after the German army occupied Paris during World War II , Meister committed suicide with his gas gun . Although often repeated , the version of his suicide stating he chose to commit suicide rather than allow the Wehrmacht to enter the Pasteurs ' crypt is not sustainable . Instead , a contemporary journal article as well as the testimony of Meister 's granddaughter indicate that he was overwhelmed by the guilt of having sent his family away , thinking it had resulted in their deaths .

He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases , and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since . He reduced mortality from puerperal fever , and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax . His medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine . He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination , a process now called pasteurization . He is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology , together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch , and is popularly known as the father of microbiology . Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation . He performed experiments that showed that without contamination , microorganisms could not develop . Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences , he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed , and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow . Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory , his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that it was true . Today , he is often regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory . Pasteur made significant discoveries in chemistry , most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization .",

Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine .",
  "/wiki/Inoculation": "The terms inoculation , vaccination , and immunization are often used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases . However , there are some important historical and current differences . In English medicine , inoculation referred only to the practice of variolation until the very early 1800s . When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798 , this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation . Soon , to avoid confusion , smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation ( from Variola = smallpox ) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination ( from Jenner 's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow ) . Then , in 1891 , Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed . Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin , which contains preformed antibody such as to diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins . Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection and the like , and questions along the lines of Have you had your flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization ? should not cause confusion . The focus is on what is being given and why , not the literal meaning of the technique used . [ citation needed ] Inoculation also has a specific meaning for procedures done in vitro . These include the transfer of microorganisms into and from laboratory apparatus such as test tubes and petri dishes in research and diagnostic laboratories , and also in commercial applications such as brewing , baking , oenology ( wine making ) , and the production of antibiotics .",
  "/wiki/Rabies": "Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months , but can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system . Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animal . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . In countries where dogs commonly have the disease , more than 99 % of rabies cases are the direct result of dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5 % of cases are from dogs .",

Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy . An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death . The opposite is hypothyroidism , when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone . Graves ' disease is the cause of about 50 % to 80 % of the cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States . Other causes include multinodular goiter , toxic adenoma , inflammation of the thyroid , eating too much iodine , and too much synthetic thyroid hormone . A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma . The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests . Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and raised T3 or T4 .",

It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products .

  "/wiki/Eclampsia": "Eclampsia is the onset of seizures ( convulsions ) in a woman with pre-eclampsia . Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction . Onset may be before , during , or after delivery . Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy . The seizures are of the tonic-clonic type and typically last about a minute . Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma . Complications include aspiration pneumonia , cerebral hemorrhage , kidney failure , and cardiac arrest . Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy . Recommendations for prevention include aspirin in those at high risk , calcium supplementation in areas with low intake , and treatment of prior hypertension with medications . Exercise during pregnancy may also be useful . The use of intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulfate improves outcomes in those with eclampsia and is generally safe . This is true in both the developed and developing world .",
  "/wiki/Morphine": "Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family which is found naturally in a number of plants and animals , including humans . It acts directly on the central nervous system ( CNS ) to decrease the feeling of pain . It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain . It is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labor . It can be given by mouth , by injection into a muscle , by injection under the skin , intravenously , injection into the space around the spinal cord , or rectally . Maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when given intravenously and after 60 minutes when given by mouth , while duration of effect is 3-7 hours . Long-acting formulations also exist . Potentially serious side effects include decreased respiratory effort and low blood pressure . Morphine is addictive and prone to abuse . If the dose is reduced after long-term use , opioid withdrawal symptoms may occur . Common side effects include drowsiness , vomiting , and constipation . Caution is advised when used during pregnancy or breast feeding , as morphine may affect the baby .",
  "/wiki/Chloral_hydrate": "Chloral hydrate is a geminal diol with the formula C2H3Cl3O2 . It is a colorless solid . It has limited use as a sedative and hypnotic pharmaceutical drug . It is also a useful laboratory chemical reagent and precursor . It is derived from chloral ( trichloroacetaldehyde ) by the addition of one equivalent of water . It was discovered in 1832 by Justus von Liebig in Gie\u00dfen when a chlorination ( halogenation ) reaction was performed on ethanol . Its sedative properties were observed by Rudolf Buchheim in 1861 , but only described in detail and published by Oscar Liebreich in 1869 ; subsequently , because of its easy synthesis , its use became widespread . It was widely used for sedation in asylums and in general medical practice , and also became a popular drug of abuse in the late 19th century . One notable recreational user , for instance , was the poet and illustrator Dante Gabriel Rossetti . Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and ethanol , readily forming concentrated solutions . A solution of chloral hydrate in ethanol called knockout drops was used to prepare a Mickey Finn . More reputable uses of chloral hydrate include as a clearing agent for chitin and fibers and as a key ingredient in Hoyer 's mounting medium , which is used to prepare permanent or semipermanent microscope slides of small organisms , histological sections , and chromosome squashes .",
  "/wiki/Silence": "Silence is the absence of ambient audible sound , the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves , or the state of having ceased to produce sounds ; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication , whether through speech or other medium . Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word , or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves . Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units , in turn-taking , or as reactive tokens , e.g. , as a sign of displeasure , disagreement , embarrassment , desire to think , confusion , and the like . Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals ; in some religious disciplines , people maintain silence for protracted periods , or even for the rest of their lives , as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation .",
  "/wiki/Childbirth": "Childbirth , also known as labour and delivery , is the ending of pregnancy where one or more babies leaves the uterus by passing through the vagina or by Caesarean section . In 2015 , there were about 135 million births globally . About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation , while between 3 and 12 percent were born after 42 weeks . In the developed world most deliveries occur in hospitals , while in the developing world most births take place at home with the support of a traditional birth attendant . The most common way of childbirth is a vaginal delivery . It involves three stages of labour : the shortening and opening of the cervix , descent and birth of the baby , and the delivery of the placenta . The first stage typically lasts 12 to 19 hours , the second stage 20 minutes to two hours , and the third stage five to 30 minutes . The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pain that last around half a minute and occur every 10 to 30 minutes . The pain becomes stronger and closer together over time . During the second stage , pushing with contractions may occur . In the third stage , delayed clamping of the umbilical cord is generally recommended . A number of methods can help with pain , such as relaxation techniques , opioids , and spinal blocks .",

Degenerative changes are associated primarily with the frontal and temporal lobar cortex . The disease affects approximately 7 % of infected individuals . It is more common among men . GPI was originally considered to be a type of madness due to a dissolute character , when first identified in the early 19th century . The condition 's connection with syphilis was discovered in the late 1880s . Subsequently , the discovery of penicillin and its use in the treatment of syphilis rendered paresis curable and avoidable . Prior to these events , paresis was inevitably fatal unless another terminating illness intervened , and it accounted for as much as 25 % of the primary diagnoses for residents in public psychiatric hospitals .",
  "/wiki/Malaria": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group . The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood . The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans .",

The system was first devised in 1937 by Dr. Paul C. Williams ( 1900-1978 ) , then a Dallas orthopedic surgeon . WFEs have been a cornerstone in the management of lower back pain for many years for treating a wide variety of back problems , regardless of diagnosis or chief complaint . In many cases they are used when the disorders cause or characteristics were not fully understood by the physician , Athletic trainer or physical therapist . Also , physical therapists and athletic trainers often teach these exercises with their own modifications .",

  "/wiki/Low_back_pain": "Low back pain ( LBP ) is a common disorder involving the muscles , nerves , and bones of the back . Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling . Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute ( pain lasting less than 6 weeks ) , sub-chronic ( 6 to 12 weeks ) , or chronic ( more than 12 weeks ) . The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical , non-mechanical , or referred pain . The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start , with 40-90 % of people completely better by six weeks . In most episodes of low back pain , a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for , with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain . If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by red flags such as unexplained weight loss , fever , or significant problems with feeling or movement , further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem . In most cases , imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks . Despite this , the use of imaging in low back pain has increased . Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs , and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause . In those with chronic pain , the pain processing system may malfunction , causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events . Initial management with non-medication based treatments is recommended .",

  "/wiki/Obesity": "Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to an extent that it may have a negative effect on health . People are generally considered obese when their body mass index ( BMI ) , a measurement obtained by dividing a person 's weight by the square of the person 's height , is over 30 kg/m2 ; the range 25-30 kg/m2 is defined as overweight . Some East Asian countries use lower values . Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions , particularly cardiovascular diseases , type 2 diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , certain types of cancer , osteoarthritis , and depression . Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake , lack of physical activity , and genetic susceptibility . A few cases are caused primarily by genes , endocrine disorders , medications , or mental disorder . The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported . On average , obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass . Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices . Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments . Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods , such as those high in fat or sugars , and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber . Medications can be used , along with a suitable diet , to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption .",
  "/wiki/Carbohydrate": "A carbohydrate ( /k\u0251\u02d0rbo\u028a\u02c8ha\u026adre\u026at/ ) is a biomolecule consisting of carbon ( C ) , hydrogen ( H ) and oxygen ( O ) atoms , usually with a hydrogen-oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 ( as in water ) and thus with the empirical formula Cm ( H2O ) n ( where m may be different from n ) . This formula holds true for monosaccharides . Some exceptions exist ; for example , deoxyribose , a sugar component of DNA , has the empirical formula C5H10O4 . The carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon ; structurally it is more accurate to view them as aldoses and ketoses . The term is most common in biochemistry , where it is a synonym of saccharide , a group that includes sugars , starch , and cellulose . The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups : monosaccharides , disaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides . Monosaccharides and disaccharides , the smallest ( lower molecular weight ) carbohydrates , are commonly referred to as sugars . The word saccharide comes from the Greek word \u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( s\u00e1kkharon ) , meaning sugar . While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex , the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose , as in the monosaccharides fructose ( fruit sugar ) and glucose ( starch sugar ) and the disaccharides sucrose ( cane or beet sugar ) and lactose ( milk sugar ) . Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms . Polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy ( e.g . starch and glycogen ) and as structural components ( e.g .",
  "/wiki/Yuzpe_regimen": "The Yuzpe regimen is a method of emergency contraception that uses a combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel . It is less effective and less commonly used than a larger dose of levonorgestrel alone , a dose of ulipristal acetate , or insertion of a copper intrauterine device . It is designed to be used within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse because it works by inhibiting ovulation . Typically , the Yuzpe regimen uses several doses of combined oral contraceptive pills . It may be preferred in locations where other forms of emergency contraception are unavailable or accessing emergency contraception carries a societal stigma . In these places , people often self-administer combined oral contraceptives as emergency contraception . Subsequently , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) undertook an investigation into the use of progestogen-only tablets as an Emergency Hormonal Contraceptive ( i.e . without any estrogen component ) . This showed greater efficacy with reduced side effects and has therefore superseded the Yuzpe method . A single dose of 10 mg mifepristone is also more effective than the Yuzpe regime .",

Emergency contraception has not been shown to affect the rates of abortion within a country . There are different forms of EC . Emergency contraceptive pills ( ECPs ) - sometimes simply referred to as emergency contraceptives ( ECs ) or the morning-after pill - are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization , which are necessary for pregnancy . ECPs and abortion pills are not the same . ECPs work by preventing or delaying ovulation and therefore preventing pregnancy , not by abortion .
