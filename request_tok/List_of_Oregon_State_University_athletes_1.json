A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",

Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players . If a selected player can not participate because of injury , the NBA commissioner selects a replacement . Starting in 2018 , the leading vote-getters for each conference are designated as team captains and can choose from the pool of All-Star reserves to form their teams regardless of conference . LeBron James and Stephen Curry became the first players to choose teams through the new format , selecting players for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game in a non-televised draft on January 25 . Likely due to fan interest in the draft process , captains for the 2019 All-Star Game , James and Giannis Antetokounmpo , drafted their teams live on TNT . The teams also play for a charity of their choice to help the games remain competitive . The head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen to lead their respective conference in the All-Star Game , with a prohibition against consecutive appearances . Known as the Riley Rule , it was created after perennially successful Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley earned the right to coach the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons between 1982 and 1990 .",

  "/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) [ a ] is a nonprofit organization that regulates student athletes from 1,268 North American institutions and conferences . It also organizes the athletic programs of many colleges and universities in the United States and Canada , and helps more than 480,000 college student-athletes who compete annually in college sports . The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis , Indiana . In its 2016-17 fiscal year the NCAA took in $ 1.06 billion in revenue , over 82% of which was generated by the Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament . In August 1973 , the current three-division system of Division I , Division II , and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention . Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA . In 2006 , Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) and Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) . Controversially , the NCAA severely caps the benefits that collegiate athletes can receive from their schools ."
