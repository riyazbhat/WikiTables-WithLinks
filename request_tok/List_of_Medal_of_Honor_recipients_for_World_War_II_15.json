Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite .

The United States Congress first authorized the Coast Guard to use the promotion to chief petty officer on 18 May 1920 . Chief petty officer is also the final cadet grade in the U.S . Naval Sea Cadet Corps . Prior to 1958 , chief petty officer was the highest enlisted grade in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard . This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage Pub.L . 85-422 , the Military Pay Act of 1958 , which established two new pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces .

Prior to establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , chief petty officers could typically serve in uniform for 30 or more years . Shortly following establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , service limits currently known as high year tenure ( HYT ) were established by pay grade .

California served as the flagship of the Battle Fleet in the Pacific Ocean for duration of her peacetime career . She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises , including the annual Fleet Problems , and cruises around the Americas and further abroad , such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925 . California was moored in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked the port , bringing the United States into World War II . The ship was moderately damaged by a pair of torpedoes and a bomb , but a fire disabled the ship 's electrical system , preventing the pumps from being used to keep the ship afloat . California slowly filled with water over the following three days and eventually sank . Her crew suffered heavy casualties in the attack and four men were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the attack . She was raised in April 1942 , repaired and heavily rebuilt , and returned to service in January 1944 . The ship thereafter supported the amphibious operations conducted during the Pacific War , including the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign ( though she was damaged in a collision with Tennessee and thus missed the Battle of Peleliu ) and the Philippines campaign , during which she took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait .

The westernmost of the five code-named landing beaches in Normandy , Utah is on the Cotentin Peninsula , west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers . Amphibious landings at Utah were undertaken by United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the United States Navy and Coast Guard as well as elements from the British , Dutch and other Allied navies . The objective at Utah was to secure a beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula , the location of important port facilities at Cherbourg . The amphibious assault , primarily by the US 4th Infantry Division and 70th Tank Battalion , was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division . The intention was to rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula , prevent the Germans from reinforcing Cherbourg , and capture the port as quickly as possible . Utah , along with Sword on the eastern flank , was added to the invasion plan in December 1943 . These changes doubled the frontage of the invasion and necessitated a month-long delay so that additional landing craft and personnel could be assembled in England . Allied forces attacking Utah faced two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment , part of the 709th Static Infantry Division . While improvements to fortifications had been undertaken under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beginning in October 1943 , the troops assigned to defend the area were mostly poorly equipped non-German conscripts . D-Day at Utah began at 01:30 , when the first of the airborne units arrived , tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland . While some airborne objectives were quickly met , many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day",
  "/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt": "Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( /\u02c8ro\u028az\u0259v\u025blt/ ROH-z\u0259-velt ; [ b ] October 27 , 1858 - January 6 , 1919 ) was an American statesman , politician , conservationist , naturalist , and writer who served as the 26th president of the United States from 1901 to 1909 . He served as the 25th vice president from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd governor of New York from 1899 to 1900 . Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the Republican Party and became a driving force for the anti-trust policy while supporting Progressive Era policies in the United States in the early 20th century . His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore alongside George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and Abraham Lincoln . He is generally ranked in polls of historians and political scientists as one of the five best presidents . Roosevelt was a sickly child with debilitating asthma , but he overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle , as well as growing out of his asthma naturally in his young adult years . He integrated his exuberant personality , vast range of interests , and world-famous achievements into a cowboy persona defined by robust masculinity . He was home-schooled , and he began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending Harvard College . His book The Naval War of 1812 ( 1882 ) established his reputation as a learned historian and as a popular writer . Upon entering politics , he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York 's state legislature . His wife and his mother both died in rapid succession , and he escaped to a cattle ranch in the Dakotas . He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley , but he resigned from that post to lead the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War , returning a war hero",

  "/wiki/Warrant_Officer_(United_States)": "In the United States Armed Forces , the ranks of warrant officer ( grades W - 1 to W - 5 ; see NATO : WO1-WO5 ) are rated as officers above all non-commissioned officers , candidates , cadets , and midshipmen , but subordinate to the lowest officer grade of O - 1 ( NATO : OF - 1 ) . This application differs from the Commonwealth of Nations and other militaries , where warrant officers are the most senior of the other ranks ( NATO : OR - 8 and OR - 9 ) , equivalent to the US Armed Forces grades of E - 8 and E - 9 . Warrant officers are highly skilled , single-track specialty officers , and while the ranks are authorized by Congress , each branch of the uniformed services selects , manages , and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways . For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one ( W - 1 ) , normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service . However , appointment to this rank can come via commission by the service secretary , the department secretary , or by the President , but this is more uncommon . For the chief warrant officer ranks ( CW - 2 to CW - 5 ) , these warrant officers are commissioned by the President . Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath as regular commissioned officers ( O - 1 to O - 10 ) . Warrant officers can and do command detachments , units , activities , vessels , aircraft , and armored vehicles , as well as lead , coach , train , and counsel subordinates . However , the warrant officer 's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert , providing valuable skills , guidance , and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field",
  "/wiki/USS_Nevada_(BB-36)": "USS Nevada ( BB-36 ) , the second United States Navy ship to be named after the 36th state , was the lead ship of the two Nevada-class battleships . Launched in 1914 , Nevada was a leap forward in dreadnought technology ; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent US battleship : triple gun turrets , [ c ] oil in place of coal for fuel , geared steam turbines for greater range , and the all or nothing armor principle . These features made Nevada , alongside its sister ship Oklahoma , the first US Navy standard-type battleships . Her only disadvantage against her continental contemporaries was her slower speed , however , her superior armor , firepower , and secondaries meant she was vastly superior . Nevada served in both World Wars . During the last few months of World War I , Nevada was based in Bantry Bay , Ireland , to protect supply convoys that were sailing to and from Great Britain . In World War II , it was one of the battleships trapped when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . Nevada was the only battleship to get underway during the attack , making the ship the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal and depressing morning for the United States . Still , it was hit by one torpedo and at least six bombs while steaming away from Battleship Row , forcing the crew to beach the stricken ship on a coral ledge . The ship continued to flood and eventually slid off the ledge and sank to the harbor floor . Nevada was subsequently salvaged and modernized at Puget Sound Navy Yard , allowing it to serve as a convoy escort in the Atlantic and as a fire-support ship in five amphibious assaults ( the invasions of Attu , Normandy , Southern France , Iwo Jima , and Okinawa ) . At the end of World War II , the Navy decided that Nevada was too old to be retained , so they assigned it to be a target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 ( Operation Crossroads )",
