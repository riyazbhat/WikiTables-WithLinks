  "/wiki/Help:Template": "A template is a Wikipedia page created to be included in other pages . Templates usually contain repetitive material that might need to show up on any number of articles or pages . They are commonly used for boilerplate messages , standard warnings or notices , infoboxes , navigational boxes , and similar purposes . The most common method of inclusion is called transclusion , where the wikitext of the target page contains a reference to the template , using the { { Template name } } syntax . Another method is substitution , where the content of the template is copied into the wikitext of the target page , just once , when it is saved . Help : A quick guide to templates gives a brief introduction to the subject . There is further help from MediaWiki and Wikimedia at mw : Help : Templates , m : Help : Template , and m : Help : Advanced templates .",
