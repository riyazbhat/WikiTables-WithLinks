  "/wiki/Government_of_Australia": "The Government of Australia is the government of the Commonwealth of Australia , a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy . It is also commonly referred to as the Australian Government , the Commonwealth Government , or the Federal Government . The legislature , also known as the Parliament of Australia , or simply Parliament , is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia . These representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation . The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution . The Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers : the House of Representatives ( or 'the lower house ' ) and the Senate ( or 'the upper house ' ) . The House of Representatives has 151 members , each representing a different area of the country ( 'electorate ' ) . Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary , meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House . The Senate is composed of 76 members . Unlike the House of Representatives , membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states . Each state has 12 senators , and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each . The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states .",

  "/wiki/War_crimes": "A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the laws of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility . Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners , torturing , destroying civilian property , taking hostages , performing a perfidy , raping , using child soldiers , pillaging , declaring that no quarter will be given , and seriously violating the principles of distinction , proportionality , and military necessity . The concept of war crimes emerged at the turn of the twentieth century when the body of customary international law applicable to warfare between sovereign states was codified . Such codification occurred at the national level , such as with the publication of the Lieber Code in the United States , and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 . Moreover , trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law . Following the end of World War II , major developments in the law occurred . Numerous trials of Axis war criminals established the Nuremberg principles , such as notion that war crimes constituted crimes defined by international law . Additionally , the Geneva Conventions in 1949 defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over such crimes . In the late 20th century and early 21st century , following the creation of several international courts , additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states , such as civil wars , were defined .",
  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension .",
  "/wiki/New_South_Wales": "New South Wales ( abbreviated as NSW ) is a state on the east coast of Australia . It borders Queensland to the north , Victoria to the south , and South Australia to the west . Its coast borders the Coral and Tasman Seas to the east . The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state . New South Wales ' state capital is Sydney , which is also Australia 's most populous city . In March 2019 [ update ] , the population of New South Wales was over 8 million , making it Australia 's most populous state . Just under two-thirds of the state 's population , 5.1 million , live in the Greater Sydney area . Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as New South Welshmen . The Colony of New South Wales was founded as a British penal colony in 1788 . It originally comprised more than half of the Australian mainland with its western boundary set at 129th meridian east in 1825 . The colony then also included the island territories of New Zealand , Van Diemen 's Land , Lord Howe Island , and Norfolk Island . During the 19th century , most of the colony 's area was detached to form separate British colonies that eventually became New Zealand and the various states and territories of Australia .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Northern_Territory": "The Northern Territory ( NT ; formally the Northern Territory of Australia ) is an Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia . It shares borders with Western Australia to the west ( 129th meridian east ) , South Australia to the south ( 26th parallel south ) , and Queensland to the east ( 138th meridian east ) . To the north , the territory looks out to the Timor Sea , the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria , including Western New Guinea and other Indonesian islands . The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres ( 520,902 sq mi ) , making it the third-largest Australian federal division , and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world . It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining .

The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide . Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray . The state 's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled , planned British province , rather than as a convict settlement . Colonial government commenced on 28 December 1836 , when the members of the council were sworn in near the Old Gum Tree . [ citation needed ] As with the rest of the continent , the region has a long history of human occupation by numerous tribes and languages .",

  "/wiki/Tasmania": "Tasmania ( /t\u00e6z\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ ; abbreviated as TAS , nicknamed Tassie ) is an island state of Australia . It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42 % of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 .
