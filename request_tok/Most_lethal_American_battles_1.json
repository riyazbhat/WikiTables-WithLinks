  "/wiki/Operation_Overlord": "Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy , the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II . The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings ( Operation Neptune , commonly known as D-Day ) . A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels . Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June , and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August . The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion . The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion , with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha , the British at Sword and Gold , and the Canadians at Juno . To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead , special technology was developed , including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart 's Funnies . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , Operation Bodyguard , using both electronic and visual misinformation . This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler 's proclaimed Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion . The Allies failed to accomplish their objectives for the first day , but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at Cherbourg on 26 June and the city of Caen on 21 July",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed",
  "/wiki/Meuse-Argonne_Offensive": "The Meuse-Argonne offensive ( also known as the Meuse River-Argonne Forest offensive , the Battles of the Meuse-Argonne , and the Meuse-Argonne campaign ) was a major part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front . It was fought from September 26 , 1918 , until the Armistice of November 11 , 1918 , a total of 47 days . The Meuse-Argonne offensive was the largest in United States military history , involving 1.2 million American soldiers . It is the second deadliest battle in American history , resulting in over 350,000 casualties including 28,000 German lives , 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives . U.S. losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops , the tactics used during the early phases of the operation and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the Spanish Flu . Meuse-Argonne was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) during World War I . It was one of a series of Allied attacks known as the Hundred Days Offensive , which brought the war to an end . It was the largest and bloodiest operation of World War I for the AEF even if , given the scale of other battles on the Western Front , its size was limited and the operation itself secondary as it was far from the main offensive axis",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge": "The Battle of the Bulge , also known as the Ardennes Counteroffensive , was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II , and took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 . It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium , northeast France , and Luxembourg , towards the end of the war in Europe . The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines , allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers ' favor . The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944 , due to a combination of Allied overconfidence , preoccupation with Allied offensive plans , and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather . American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war . The battle also severely depleted Germany 's armored forces , and they were largely unable to replace them . German personnel and , later , Luftwaffe aircraft ( in the concluding stages of the engagement ) also sustained heavy losses . The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops . The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame , south east of Dinant , being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944",
  "/wiki/Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany": "The Western Allied invasion of Germany was coordinated by the Western Allies during the final months of hostilities in the European theatre of World War II . In preparation for the Allied invasion of Germany , a series of offensive operations were designed to seize and capture the east and west bank of the Rhine River : Operation Veritable and Operation Grenade in February 1945 , and Operation Lumberjack and Operation Undertone in March 1945 . The Allied invasion of Germany started with the Western Allies crossing the Rhine on 22 March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to the Alpine passes in the south , where they linked up with troops of the U.S. Fifth Army in Italy . Combined with the capture of Berchtesgaden , any hope of Nazi leadership continuing to wage war from a so-called National redoubt or escape through the Alps was crushed , shortly followed by unconditional German surrender on 8 May 1945 . This is known as the Central Europe campaign in United States military histories . By early 1945 , events favored the Allied forces in Europe . On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany with campaigns against the Siegfried Line since the Battle of Aachen and the Battle of Hurtgen Forest in late 1944 and by January 1945 had pushed the Germans back to their starting points during the Battle of the Bulge . The failure of this offensive exhausted Germany 's strategic reserve , leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe . Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army , leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine . On 7 March , the Allies seized the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen , and had established a large bridgehead on the river 's east bank . During Operation Lumberjack , Operation Plunder and Operation Undertone in March 1945 , German casualties during February-March 1945 are estimated at 400,000 men , including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war . On the Eastern Front , the Soviet Red Army ( including the Polish Armed Forces in the East under Soviet command ) simultaneously with the Western Allies , had taken most of Poland and began their offensive into Eastern Germany in February 1945 , and by March were within striking distance of Berlin",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa": "The Battle of Okinawa ( Japanese : \u6c96\u7e04\u6226 , Hepburn : Okinawa-sen ) ( Okinawan : \u6c96\u7e04\u6226 , romanized : Uchinaa ikusa ) , codenamed Operation Iceberg , was a major battle of the Pacific War fought on the island of Okinawa by United States Marine and Army forces against the Imperial Japanese Army . The initial invasion of Okinawa on April 1 , 1945 , was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater of World War II . The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22 , 1945 . After a long campaign of island hopping , the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall , the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands , 340 mi ( 550 km ) away . The United States created the Tenth Army , a cross-branch force consisting of the 7th , 27th , 77th , and 96th infantry divisions of the US Army with the 1st , 2nd , and 6th divisions of the Marine Corps , to fight on the island . The Tenth was unique in that it had its own tactical air force ( joint Army-Marine command ) , and was also supported by combined naval and amphibious forces . The battle has been referred to as the typhoon of steel in English , and tetsu no ame ( rain of steel ) or tetsu no b\u014df\u016b ( violent wind of steel ) in Japanese . The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting , the intensity of Japanese kamikaze attacks , and the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island . The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific , with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides : at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166-117,000 Japanese , including drafted Okinawans wearing Japanese uniforms . 149,425 Okinawans were killed , committed suicide or went missing , a significant proportion of the estimated pre-war 300,000 local population . In the naval operations surrounding the battle , both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft , including the Japanese battleship Yamato . After the battle , Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage , troop staging areas , and airfields in proximity to Japan in preparation for a planned invasion",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_H\u00fcrtgen_Forest": "The Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest ( German : Schlacht im H\u00fcrtgenwald ) was a series of fierce battles fought from 19 September to 16 December 1944 , between American and German forces on the Western Front during World War II , in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest , a 140 km2 ( 54 sq mi ) area about 5 km ( 3.1 mi ) east of the Belgian-German border . It was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and is the longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought . The U.S. commanders ' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the Battle of Aachen , where the US forces were fighting against the Siegfried Line network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes , tank traps , and minefields . A secondary objective may have been to outflank the front line . [ citation needed ] The Americans ' initial tactical objectives were to take Schmidt and clear Monschau . In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen . Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill . While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the Battle of Arnhem , he still kept himself fully informed on the situation , slowing the Allies ' progress , inflicting heavy casualties , and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the Westwall , better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line . The H\u00fcrtgen Forest cost the U.S. First Army at least 33,000 killed and wounded , including both combat and non-combat losses , with upper estimate at 55,000 ; German casualties were 28,000 . The city of Aachen in the north eventually fell on 22 October at high cost to the U.S. Ninth Army , but they failed to cross the Rur or wrest control of its dams from the Germans . The battle was so costly that it has been described as an Allied defeat of the first magnitude , with specific credit given to Model . :391 The Germans fiercely defended the area because it served as a staging area for the 1944 winter offensive Unternehmen : Wacht am Rhein ( later known as the Battle of the Bulge ) , and because the mountains commanded access to the Rur Dam [ notes 3 ] at the head of the Rur Reservoir ( Rurstausee )",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Line": "The Gothic Line ( German : Gotenstellung ; Italian : Linea Gotica ) was a German defensive line of the Italian Campaign of World War II . It formed Field Marshal Albert Kesselring 's last major line of defence along the summits of the northern part of the Apennine Mountains during the fighting retreat of the German forces in Italy against the Allied Armies in Italy , commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander . Adolf Hitler had concerns about the state of preparation of the Gothic Line : he feared the Allies would use amphibious landings to outflank its defences . To downgrade its importance in the eyes of both friend and foe , he ordered the name , with its historic connotations , changed , reasoning that if the Allies managed to break through they would not be able to use the more impressive name to magnify their victory claims . In response to this order , Kesselring renamed it the Green Line ( Gr\u00fcne Linie ) in June 1944 . Using more than 15,000 slave labourers , the Germans created more than 2,000 well-fortified machine gun nests , casemates , bunkers , observation posts and artillery fighting positions to repel any attempt to breach the Gothic Line . Initially this line was breached during Operation Olive ( also sometimes known as the Battle of Rimini ) , but Kesselring 's forces were consistently able to retire in good order . This continued to be the case up to March 1945 , with the Gothic Line being breached but with no decisive breakthrough ; this would not take place until April 1945 during the final Allied offensive of the Italian Campaign . Operation Olive has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy . Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle . The battle took the form of a pincer manoeuvre , carried out by the British Eighth Army and the U.S. Fifth Army against the German 10th Army ( 10 . Armee ) and German 14th Army ( 14",

The battle resulted in a U.S. and Filipino victory . The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations of Luzon by March 1945 , although pockets of Japanese resistance held out in the mountains until the unconditional surrender of Japan . While not the highest in U.S. casualties , it is the highest net casualty battle U.S. forces fought in World War II , with 192,000 to 205,000 Japanese combatants dead ( mostly from starvation and disease ) , 8,000 American combatants killed , and over 150,000 Filipinos , overwhelmingly civilians who were murdered by Japanese forces , mainly during the Manila massacre of February , 1945",
  "/wiki/Operation_Dragoon": "Operation Dragoon ( initially Operation Anvil ) was the code name for the landing operation of the Allied invasion of Provence ( Southern France ) on 15 August 1944 . The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord , the Allied landing in Normandy , but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing . By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered , as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces . Concurrently , the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops . As a result , the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August . The goal of the invasion was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front . After some preliminary commando operations , the US VI Corps landed on the beaches of the C\u00f4te d'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force , followed by several divisions of the French Army B . They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G , which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate Ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment . Hindered by total Allied air superiority and a large-scale uprising by the French Resistance , the weak German forces were swiftly defeated . The Germans withdrew to the north through the Rh\u00f4ne valley , to establish a stable defense line at Dijon . Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Mont\u00e9limar . The ensuing battle led to a stalemate , with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough , until the Germans were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town",
  "/wiki/Guadalcanal_Campaign": "The Guadalcanal campaign , also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal and codenamed Operation Watchtower by American forces , was a military campaign fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943 on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of World War II . It was the first major land offensive by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan . On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces , predominantly United States Marines , landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands , with the objective of using Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases in supporting a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain . The Japanese defenders , who had occupied those islands since May 1942 , were outnumbered and overwhelmed by the Allies , who captured Tulagi and Florida , as well as the airfield - later named Henderson Field - that was under construction on Guadalcanal . Surprised by the Allied offensive , the Japanese made several attempts between August and November to retake Henderson Field . Three major land battles , seven large naval battles ( five nighttime surface actions and two carrier battles ) , and almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November , with the defeat of the last Japanese attempt to bombard Henderson Field from the sea and to land enough troops to retake it . In December , the Japanese abandoned their efforts to retake Guadalcanal , and evacuated their remaining forces by 7 February 1943 , in the face of an offensive by the U.S. Army 's XIV Corps . The Guadalcanal campaign was a significant strategic Allied combined-arms victory in the Pacific theater . While the Battle of Midway was a heavy defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy , it did not stop Japanese offensives , which continued both at sea and on the ground . The victories at Milne Bay , Buna-Gona , and Guadalcanal marked the Allied transition from defensive operations to taking the strategic initiative in the theater , leading to offensive campaigns in the Solomon Islands , New Guinea , and the Central Pacific , which resulted in the surrender of Japan , ending World War II",

It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine , but could not clear central Alsace . During Operation Nordwind in December 1944 , the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace . In late January and early February 1945 , the French First Army ( reinforced by the U.S. XXI Corps ) cleared the Pocket of German forces",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima": "The Battle of Iwo Jima ( 19 February - 26 March 1945 ) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps and Navy landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II . The American invasion , designated Operation Detachment , had the goal of capturing the entire island , including the three Japanese-controlled airfields ( including the South Field and the Central Field ) , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands . This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II . After the heavy losses incurred in the battle , the strategic value of the island became controversial . It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base . However , Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips , which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s . The IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions , and 18 km ( 11 mi ) of tunnels . The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery , and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle . Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although , uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles , American total casualties ( dead and wounded ) exceeded those of the Japanese . Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle , only 216 were taken prisoner , some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled . The majority of the remainder were killed in action , although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards , eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later . Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides , the American victory was assured from the start",

  "/wiki/Operation_Avalanche": "Operation Avalanche was the codename for the Allied landings near the port of Salerno , executed on 9 September 1943 , part of the Allied invasion of Italy . The Italians withdrew from the war the day before the invasion , but the Allies landed in an area defended by German troops . Planned under the name Top Hat , it was supported by the deception plan Operation Boardman . The landings were carried out by the US Fifth Army , under American General Mark W. Clark . It comprised the U.S. VI Corps , the British X Corps and the US 82nd Airborne Division , a total of about nine divisions . Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply , and to cut across to the east coast , trapping the Axis troops further south . In order to draw troops away from the landing ground , Operation Baytown was mounted . This was a landing by the British Eighth Army in Calabria in the 'toe ' of Italy , on 3 September . Simultaneous sea landings were made by the British 1st Airborne Division at the port of Taranto ( Operation Slapstick ) . British General Bernard Montgomery had predicted Baytown would be a waste of effort because it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria ; if they failed to do so , the diversion would not work . He was proved correct . After Baytown the Eighth Army marched 300 miles ( 480 km ) north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineer obstacles",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Anzio": "The Battle of Anzio was a battle of the Italian Campaign of World War II that took place from January 22 , 1944 ( beginning with the Allied amphibious landing known as Operation Shingle ) to June 5 , 1944 ( ending with the capture of Rome ) . The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of Anzio and Nettuno . Nettuno was the German name for the Battle of Anzio . The operation was initially commanded by Major General John P. Lucas , of the U.S. Army , commanding U.S. VI Corps with the intention being to outflank German forces at the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome . The success of an amphibious landing at that location , in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains , depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders . Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders . Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark , commander of the U.S. Fifth Army , understood that risk , but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate , [ citation needed ] Lucas , who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack . The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome . However , Lucas , who had little confidence in the operation as planned , failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength . While Lucas consolidated , Field Marshal Albert Kesselring , the German commander in the Italian theatre , moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the beachhead . His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position . The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water , planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by epidemic",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Pusan_Perimeter": "The Battle of the Pusan Perimeter was a large-scale battle between United Nations Command ( UN ) and North Korean forces lasting from August 4 to September 18 , 1950 . It was one of the first major engagements of the Korean War . An army of 140,000 UN troops , having been pushed to the brink of defeat , were rallied to make a final stand against the invading Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , 98,000 men strong . UN forces , having been repeatedly defeated by the advancing KPA , were forced back to the Pusan Perimeter , a 140-mile ( 230 km ) defensive line around an area on the southeastern tip of South Korea that included the port of Busan . The UN troops , consisting mostly of forces from the Republic of Korea Army ( ROK ) , United States , and United Kingdom mounted a last stand around the perimeter , fighting off repeated KPA attacks for six weeks as they were engaged around the cities of Daegu , Masan , and Pohang and the Nakdong River . The massive KPA assaults were unsuccessful in forcing the UN troops back further from the perimeter , despite two major pushes in August and September . North Korean troops , hampered by supply shortages and massive losses , continually staged attacks on UN forces in an attempt to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line . However , the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops , equipment , and logistics , and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the KPA during the fight . After six weeks , the KPA force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15 and the UN forces in the perimeter broke out from the perimeter the following day . The battle would be the furthest the KPA would advance in the war , as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate",

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90 % of the military personnel .
