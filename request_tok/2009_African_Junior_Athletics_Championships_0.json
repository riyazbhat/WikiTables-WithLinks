  "/wiki/1500_metres": "The 1500 metres or 1,500-metre run ( typically pronounced 'fifteen-hundred metres ' ) is the foremost middle distance track event in athletics . The distance has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 and the World Championships in Athletics since 1983 . It is equivalent to 1.5 kilometers or approximately \u200b15\u204416 miles . The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race . The women 's 1,500-metre race was first added to the Summer Olympics in 1972 , and the winner of the first gold medal was Lyudmila Bragina of the Soviet Union . During the Olympic Games of 1972 through 2008 , the women 's 1,500-metre race has been won by three Soviets plus one Russian , one Italian , one Romanian , one Briton , one Kenyan , and two Algerians .",
  "/wiki/Kenya": "Kenya ( /\u02c8k\u025bnj\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Kenya ( Swahili : Jamhuri ya Kenya ) , is a country in Africa with 47 semiautonomous counties governed by elected governors . At 580,367 square kilometres ( 224,081 sq mi ) , Kenya is the world 's 48th largest country by total area . With a population of more than 47.6 million people , Kenya is the 29th most populous country . Kenya 's capital and largest city is Nairobi , while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa . Kisumu City is the third largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria . Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret . Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic . Nilotic-speaking pastoralists ( ancestral to Kenya 's Nilotic speakers ) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC . European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior . Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920 . Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution , which began in 1952 , and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963 .",

  "/wiki/400_m_hurdles": "The 400 metres hurdles is a track and field hurdling event . The event has been on the Olympic athletics programme since 1900 for men and since 1984 for women . On a standard outdoor track , 400 metres is the length of the inside lane , once around the stadium . Runners stay in their lanes the entire way after starting out of the blocks and must clear ten hurdles that are evenly spaced around the track . The hurdles are positioned and weighted so that they fall forward if bumped into with sufficient force , to prevent injury to the runners . Although there is no longer any penalty for knocking hurdles over , runners prefer to clear them cleanly , as touching them during the race slows runners down . The best male athletes can run the 400 m hurdles in a time of around 47 seconds , while the best female athletes achieve a time of around 53 seconds . The current men 's and women 's world record holders are Kevin Young with 46.78 seconds and Dalilah Muhammad with 52.16 seconds . Compared to the 400 metres run , the hurdles race takes the men about three seconds longer and the women four seconds longer . The 400 m hurdles was held for both sexes at the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics . The first championship for women came at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics - being held as a one-off due to the lack of a race at the 1980 Summer Olympics .",
  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

  "/wiki/Pole_vault": "Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole ( which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber ) as an aid to jump over a bar . Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks , Cretans and Celts . It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since 2000 for women . It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics , alongside the high jump , long jump and triple jump . It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate , even at a basic level . A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics , including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg , reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports . Running speed , however , may be the most dominant factor . Physical attributes such as speed , agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively , but technical skill is an equally if not more important element . The object of pole vaulting is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights ( standards ) without knocking it down .",
  "/wiki/Triple_jump": "The triple jump , sometimes referred to as the hop , step and jump or the hop , skip and jump , is a track and field event , similar to the long jump . As a group , the two events are referred to as the horizontal jumps . The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop , a bound and then a jump into the sand pit . The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games ' inception in 1896 . According to IAAF rules , the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot as that from which he has taken off ; in the step he shall land on the other foot , from which , subsequently , the jump is performed . The current male and female world record holders are Jonathan Edwards , with a jump of 18.29 m ( 60 ft 0.08 in ) , and Inessa Kravets of Ukraine , with a jump of 15.50 m ( 50 ft 10.24 in ) .

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
  "/wiki/Decathlon": "The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events . The word decathlon was formed , in analogy to the word pentathlon , from Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 ( d\u00e9ka , meaning ten ) and \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( \u00e1thlos , or \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd , \u00e1thlon , meaning contest or prize ) . Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all . Performance is judged on a points system in each event , not by the position achieved . The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes , while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon . Traditionally , the title of World 's Greatest Athlete has been given to the person who wins the decathlon , thus the world 's greatest athlete of all times is the record-man of decathlon ( Kevin Mayer as of September 2018 ) . This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe , You , sir , are the world 's greatest athlete after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912 . The event is similar to the pentathlon held at the ancient Greek Olympics , and also similar to a competition called an all-around , which was contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884 . Another all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics . The modern decathlon first appeared at the 1912 Games . The current official decathlon world record holder is French Kevin Mayer , who scored a total of 9,126 points at the 2018 D\u00e9castar in France .",

The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m.
