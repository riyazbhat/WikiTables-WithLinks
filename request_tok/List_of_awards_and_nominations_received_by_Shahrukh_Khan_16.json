  "/wiki/Honorary_degree": "An honorary degree [ note 1 ] is an academic degree for which a university ( or other degree-awarding institution ) has waived the usual requirements , such as matriculation , residence , a dissertation , and the passing of comprehensive examinations . It is also known by the Latin phrases honoris causa ( for the sake of the honour ) or ad honorem ( to the honour ) . The degree is typically a doctorate or , less commonly , a master 's degree , and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution or no previous postsecondary education . An example of identifying a recipient of this award is as follows : Doctorate in Business Administration ( Hon . Causa ) . The degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor 's contributions to a specific field or to society in general . It is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one 's curriculum vitae ( CV ) as an award , and not in the education section . With regard to the use of this honorific , the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients refrain from adopting the misleading title and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate should restrict the use of the title Dr before their name to any engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community . Rev . Theodore Hesburgh held the record for most honorary degrees , having been awarded 150 during his lifetime .",

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language .
