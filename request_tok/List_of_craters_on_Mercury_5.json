  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person , place , or thing after whom or after which something is named , or believed to be named , or the thing so named . The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic . For example , Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era , and the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company refers to Henry Ford , and Ford and Elizabethan England are both eponyms",
  "/wiki/William_Faulkner": "William Cuthbert Faulkner ( /\u02c8f\u0254\u02d0kn\u0259r/ ; September 25 , 1897 - July 6 , 1962 ) was an American writer and Nobel Prize laureate from Oxford , Mississippi . Faulkner wrote novels , short stories , screenplays , poetry , essays , and a play . He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County , based on Lafayette County , Mississippi , where he spent most of his life . Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in American literature generally and Southern literature specifically . Though his work was published as early as 1919 and largely during the 1920s and 1930s , Faulkner 's renown reached its peak upon the publication of Malcolm Cowley 's The Portable Faulkner and his 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature , making him the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner . Two of his works , A Fable ( 1954 ) and his last novel The Reivers ( 1962 ) , each won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction . In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century ; also on the list were As I Lay Dying ( 1930 ) and Light in August ( 1932 ) . Absalom , Absalom ! ( 1936 ) appears on similar lists . [ citation needed ]",

She spent her entire career as a dancer with the Royal Ballet ( formerly the Sadler 's Wells Theatre Company ) , eventually being appointed prima ballerina assoluta of the company by Queen Elizabeth II . Beginning ballet lessons at the age of four , she studied in England and China , where her father was transferred for his work . Her training in Shanghai was with George Goncharov , contributing to her continuing interest in Russian ballet . Returning to London at the age of 14 , she was invited to join the Vic-Wells Ballet School by Ninette de Valois . She succeeded Alicia Markova as prima ballerina of the company in 1935 . The Vic-Wells choreographer , Sir Frederick Ashton , wrote numerous parts for Fonteyn and her partner , Robert Helpmann , with whom she danced from the 1930s to the 1940s . In 1946 , the company , now renamed the Sadler 's Wells Ballet , moved into the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden where Fonteyn 's most frequent partner throughout the next decade was Michael Somes . Her performance in Tchaikovskys The Sleeping Beauty became a distinguishing role for both Fonteyn and the company , but she was also well known for the ballets created by Ashton , including Symphonic Variations , Cinderella , Daphnis and Chloe , Ondine and Sylvia . In 1949 , she led the company in a tour of the United States and became an international celebrity . Before and after the Second World War , Fonteyn performed in televised broadcasts of ballet performances in Britain and in the early 1950s appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show , consequently increasing the popularity of dance in the United States . In 1955 , she married the Panamanian politician Roberto Arias and appeared in a live colour production of The Sleeping Beauty aired on NBC",
