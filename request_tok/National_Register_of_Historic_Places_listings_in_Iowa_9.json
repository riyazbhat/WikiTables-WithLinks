It is significant as the home of farmer and hybrid corn populizer Roswell Garst . During the 1930s and 1940s , Garst played an active role in the conversion of old-style family farms to modern agribusiness . He was a key marketer of hybrid seed corn , which greatly increased corn yields per acre . Further , he espoused the use of nitrogen and other chemical fertilizers to renew soil so that fields need not be left fallow in order for the soil to replenish , allowing farmers to grow more acres of corn . Additionally , he embraced the use of cellulose from corncobs left after processing seed corn as cattle feed . The farm is also famous as site of a visit on September 23 , 1959 , by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev . The visit was not their first meeting , and it was by Khrushchev 's request . Garst 's farm had been visited by Soviet officials first in 1955 , as an unofficial extra when they were on an organized tour of smaller farms . The Garst farm , with its use of hybrid corn and other agricultural innovations , was the only large size farm at all comparable to the scale of Soviet collective farms that the official was able to visit , and that was only by getting away from the official tour . Subsequently , Garst visited the Soviet Union to sell hybrid corn there and spread information about modern American farming methods . He met Khrushchev , and they found they had much in common",
