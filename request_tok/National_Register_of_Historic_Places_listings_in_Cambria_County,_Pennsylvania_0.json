  "/wiki/Allegheny_Portage_Railroad": "The Allegheny Portage Railroad was the first railroad constructed through the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania , United States ; it operated from 1834 to 1854 as the first transportation infrastructure through the gaps of the Allegheny that connected the midwest to the eastern seaboard across the barrier range of the Allegheny Front . Approximately 36 miles ( 58 km ) long overall , both ends connected to the Pennsylvania Canal , and the system was primarily used as a portage railway , haulting river boats and barges over the divide between the Ohio and the Susquehanna Rivers . The railroad was authorized as part of the Main Line of Public Works legislation in 1824 . It had five inclines on either side of the drainage divide running athwart the ridge line from Blair Gap through along the kinked saddle at the summit into Cresson , Pennsylvania . The endpoints connected to the Canal at Johnstown on the west through the relative flats to Hollidaysburg on the east . The Railroad utilized cleverly designed wheeled barges to ride a narrow-gauge rail track with steam-powered stationary engines lifting the vehicles . The roadbed of the railroad did not incline monotonically upwards , but rose in relatively long , saw-toothed stretches of slightly-sloped flat terrain suitable to animal powered towing , alternating with steep cable railway inclined planes using static steam engine powered windlasses , similar to mechanisms of modern ski lifts . Except for peak moments of severe storms , it was an all-weather , all-seasons operation . Along with the rest of the Main Works , it cut transport time from Philadelphia to the Ohio River from weeks to just 3-5 days . Considered a technological marvel in its day , it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce . It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States , the Staple Bend Tunnel , and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare .",
