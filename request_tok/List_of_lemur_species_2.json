Major was born in Glasgow and studied at Basel and Zurich Universities in Switzerland and later G\u00f6ttingen in Germany . He graduated in medicine at Basel in 1868 and became a physician in Florence , Italy . Like many early naturalists he spent his free time studying fossil mammals . His first publication was on fossil primates in 1872 . The Italian government supported him in 1877 and he collected fossils from Calabria , Corsica , Sardinia , and Sicily . In 1886 , he stopped practising as a physician and began to study fossils in the Greek Archipelago with his collections going to the College Galliard at Lausanne and to the British Museum ( Natural History ) . In the British Museum collections he took a keen interest in material from Madagascar . He studied the lemur fauna , both extant and extinct , discovered the new family Megaladapidae ( Major 1893 ) , genus and species of the extinct giant lemur Megaladapis madagascariensis ( Major 1893 ) , and five new species in the genera Lepilemur and Cheirogaleus . This led to a keen interest in Madagascar and initiated an expedition to it . His field trip was funded by The Royal Society along with funds from Lionel Walter Rothschild , F. DuCane Godman , Sir Henry Peek and himself . The expedition started from Britain on 15 July 1894 and returned on 30 August 1896",

Described in 1894 , it was considered either a subspecies or taxonomic synonym of the weasel sportive lemur ( Lepilemur mustelinus ) throughout most of the 20th century . Phylogenetic studies not only support its species status , but also suggest that it is the only eastern Malagasy sportive lemur that is more closely related to western than to other eastern species . According to the original description , some of its teeth are smaller than those in other sportive lemurs . It is relatively large for a sportive lemur , and is difficult to visually distinguish from the weasel sportive lemur .

It is a nocturnal species feeding largely on leaves , though they also eat some fruit . Individuals weigh around 800 g ( 1.8 lb ) , and there is little sexual dimorphism . In general they live in mated pairs , with a home range of about 10,000 square metres . Both members of the pair use the same home range , and there is little overlap between the home ranges of neighbouring pairs . Travel distances each night are between 100 m ( 330 ft ) and 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) , making this a relatively inactive species . This species can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests . Red-tailed Sportive Lemurs travel in this pairs because it can be difficult for a male to produce roaming strategies and move farther away from the homeland . Therefore , they typically pair up with only one female for reproduction , hence their partner . Additionally , these Lemurs dont typically have a strong early warning system , making it difficult for them to warm others or send a signal . Instead , they have grown to develop strong escape mechanisms for them to flee danger . Many studies and experiments have been conducted to produce this information",

From a very wealthy family , at the age of 20 , he and his brother , Ernest Grandidier ( 1833-1912 ) , undertook a voyage around the world . At first they were led by the astronomer and physicist Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen ( 1824-1907 ) , but when Janssen fell sick and had to return to France after about six months , the brothers continued the journey . They visited South America in 1858 and 1859 and in particular the Andes , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina and Brazil . During this voyage they gathered a significant collection of specimens which were analyzed , in 1860 , by Ernest . The two brothers parted ways after this . Ernest Grandidier went to China and collected a vast number of specimens which are now in the Louvre and the Guimet museum . Alfred travelled to India , reaching it in 1863 . He had intended to explore the high plateau of Tibet , but was prevented by a severe attack of fever . Grandidier travelled to Zanzibar to recuperate , remaining some time and making important collections and publishing an account of his findings . He then visited the island of R\u00e9union and in 1865 made his first visit to Madagascar . He became devoted to the study of the island , revisiting in 1866 and 1868"
