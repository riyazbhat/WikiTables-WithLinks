It stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco river , at the point where it is joined by its main tributary , the Caron\u00ed river .

There are three bridges across the Caroni and the second crossing over the Orinoco , the Orinoquia Bridge , was inaugurated in the city in 2006 . With approximately one million people , it is Venezuela 's fastest-growing city [ citation needed ] due to its important iron , steel , aluminium and hydroelectric industries . Ciudad Guayana is one of Venezuela 's five most important ports , since most goods produced in the industry-rich Bol\u00edvar state are shipped through it , as ocean-going vessels can sail to it from the Atlantic Ocean up the Orinoco river . Due to its planned nature , the city has a drastically different feel from many other South American cities . The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla , and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s , including 'cookie cutter ' homes , sidewalks , and patterned lawns . This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel , an American company with iron mining operations in the region . US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American expatriate workers and families , who lived in Puerto Ordaz and other communities until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to leave .",
