  "/wiki/Liao_Dynasty": "The Liao dynasty ( /lja\u028a/ ; Khitan : Mos J\u00e6lud ; traditional Chinese : \u907c\u671d ; simplified Chinese : \u8fbd\u671d ; pinyin : Li\u00e1o ch\u00e1o ) , also known as the Liao Empire , officially the Great Liao ( \u5927\u907c ; \u5927\u8fbd ; D\u00e0 Li\u00e1o ) , or the Khitan ( Qidan ) State ( Khitan : Mos diau-d kitai huld\u0292i gur ) , was an empire and imperial dynasty in East Asia that ruled from 916 to 1125 over present-day Northern and Northeast China , Mongolia and portions of the Russian Far East and North Korea . The empire was founded by Yel\u00fc Abaoji ( Emperor Taizu of Liao ) , Khagan of the Khitans around the time of the collapse of the Tang dynasty and was the first state to control all of Manchuria . Being ruled by the Khitan Yel\u00fc clan , the Liao dynasty is considered by historians to be a conquest dynasty of China . Almost immediately after its founding , the Liao dynasty began a process of territorial expansion , with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae . Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Later Tang ( 923-936 ) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo after losing the Goryeo-Khitan Wars . In 1004 , the Liao dynasty launched an imperial expedition against the Northern Song dynasty . After heavy fighting and large casualties between the two empires , both sides worked out the Chanyuan Treaty . Through the treaty , the Liao dynasty forced the Northern Song to recognize them as peers and heralded an era of peace and stability between the two powers that lasted approximately 120 years . Tension between traditional Khitan social and political practices and Chinese influence and customs was a defining feature of the dynasty . This tension led to a series of succession crises ; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture , while much of the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate . So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments . The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices , while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations , adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices .",

It followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty . Although the Mongols had ruled territories including modern-day North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style , and the conquest was not complete until 1279 when the Southern Song dynasty was defeated in the Battle of Yamen . His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other Mongol khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia . It was the first non-Han Chinese dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan forces . Following that , the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule as the Northern Yuan dynasty . Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language , while others only used their native language ( i.e . Mongolian ) and the 'Phags-pa script .

Starting at Beijing , it passes through Tianjin and the provinces of Hebei , Shandong , Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the city of Hangzhou , linking the Yellow River and Yangtze River . The oldest parts of the canal date back to the 5th century BC , but the various sections were first connected during the Sui dynasty ( 581-618 AD ) . Dynasties in 1271-1633 significantly rebuilt the canal and altered its route to supply their capital Beijing . The total length of the Grand Canal is 1,776 km ( 1,104 mi ) . Its greatest height is reached in the mountains of Shandong , at a summit of 42 m ( 138 ft ) . Ships in Chinese canals did not have trouble reaching higher elevations after the pound lock was invented in the 10th century , during the Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , by the government official and engineer Qiao Weiyue . The canal has been admired by many throughout history including Japanese monk Ennin ( 794-864 ) , Persian historian Rashid al-Din ( 1247-1318 ) , Korean official Choe Bu ( 1454-1504 ) , and Italian missionary Matteo Ricci ( 1552-1610 ) . Historically , periodic flooding of the Yellow River threatened the safety and functioning of the canal . During wartime , the high dikes of the Yellow River were sometimes deliberately broken in order to flood and thus sweep away advancing enemy troops . This would cause disaster and prolonged economic hardships for local residents . Despite temporary periods of desolation and disuse , the Grand Canal furthered an indigenous and growing economic market in China 's urban centers from the Sui period onwards to the present .",

During this period , the Zhou royal authority over the various feudal states eroded , as more and more dukes and marquesses obtained de facto regional autonomy , defying the king 's court in Luoyi , and waging wars amongst themselves .

It was established in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution , which overthrew the Qing dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . The Republic 's first president , Sun Yat-sen , served only briefly before handing over the position to Yuan Shikai , the leader of the Beiyang Army . Sun 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , then led by Song Jiaoren , won the parliamentary election held in December 1912 . However , Song was assassinated on Yuan 's orders shortly after ; and the Beiyang Army , led by Yuan , maintained full control of the Beiyang government . Between late 1915 and early 1916 , Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China before abdicating not long after due to popular unrest . After Yuan 's death in 1916 , the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty . Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing Warlord Era . In 1921 , the KMT established a rival government in Canton , supported by the fledgling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . The economy of northern China , overtaxed to support warlord adventurism , collapsed between 1927 and 1928 . General Chiang Kai-shek , who became the KMT leader after Sun 's death , started the Northern Expedition in 1926 to overthrow the Beiyang government , which was accomplished in 1928 .

The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese . Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ) , numerous rump regimes loyal to the Ming throne - collectively called the Southern Ming - survived until 1662 . [ d ] The Hongwu Emperor ( r. 1368-1398 ) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the Jingnan Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats . One , Zheng He , led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa . The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances ; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely . The imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the Liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the Great Wall of China into its modern form . Wide-ranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially , but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at Nanjing hampered accurate figures .",
