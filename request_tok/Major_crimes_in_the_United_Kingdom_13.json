  "/wiki/Clerkenwell_explosion": "The Clerkenwell explosion , also known as the Clerkenwell Outrage , was a bombing in London on 13 December 1867 . The Irish Republican Brotherhood , nicknamed the Fenians , exploded a bomb to try to free one of their members being held on remand at Clerkenwell Prison . The explosion damaged nearby houses , killed 12 people and caused 120 injuries . None of the prisoners escaped . The event was described by The Times the following day as a crime of unexampled atrocity , and compared to the infernal machines used in Paris in 1800 and 1835 and the Gunpowder Treason of 1605 . The bombing was later described as the most infamous action carried out by the Fenians in Britain in the 19th century . It enraged the public , causing a backlash of hostility in Britain which undermined efforts to establish home rule or independence for Ireland",
  "/wiki/Fenians": "The word Fenian ( /\u02c8fi\u02d0ni\u0259n/ ) served as an umbrella term for the Fenian Brotherhood and the Irish Republican Brotherhood ( IRB ) , fraternal organisations dedicated to the establishment of an independent Irish Republic in the 19th and early 20th centuries . The name originated with the Fianna in Irish mythology - groups of legendary warrior-bands associated with Fionn mac Cumhail . Mythological tales of the Fianna became known as the Fenian Cycle . The term Fenian today occurs as a derogatory sectarian term in Ireland , referring to Irish nationalists and/or Catholics , particularly in Northern Ireland , though the term is commonly not viewed as negative by the community receiving the term . The term has been used similarly in Scotland as a religious slur to refer to Scottish Catholics or to Scots with Irish ancestry",

Each continued to call itself simply the IRA and rejected the other 's legitimacy . Unlike the Provisionals , the Officials did n't think that Ireland could be unified until the Protestant majority of Northern Ireland and Catholic minority of Northern Ireland were at peace with each other . The Officials were Marxist and worked to form a united front with other Irish communist groups , named the Irish National Liberation Front ( NLF ) . The Officials were called the NLF by the Provisionals and were sometimes nicknamed the Red IRA by others . It waged a limited campaign against the British Army , mainly involving shooting and bombing attacks on troops in urban working-class neighbourhoods . Most notably , it was involved in the 1970 Falls Curfew and carried out the 1972 Aldershot bombing . In May 1972 , it declared a ceasefire and vowed to limit its actions to defence and retaliation . By this time , the Provisional IRA had become the larger and more active faction . Following the ceasefire , the OIRA began to be referred to as Group B within the Official movement",

  "/wiki/Car_bomb": "A car bomb , lorry bomb , or truck bomb , also known as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device ( VBIED ) , is an improvised explosive device designed to be placed and detonated in an automobile or other vehicles . Car bombs can be roughly divided into two main categories : those used primarily to kill the occupants of the vehicle ( often as an assassination ) and those used as a means to kill , injure or damage people and buildings outside the vehicle . The latter type may be either parked ( the vehicle disguising the bomb and allowing the bomber to get away ) or the vehicle might be used to deliver the bomb ( often as part of a suicide bombing ) . It is commonly used as a weapon of terrorism or guerrilla warfare to kill people near the blast site or to damage buildings or other property . Car bombs act as their own delivery mechanisms and can carry a relatively large amount of explosives without attracting suspicion ; in larger vehicles and trucks , weights of around 7,000 pounds ( 3,200 kg ) or more have been used , for example , in the Oklahoma City bombing . Car bombs are activated in a variety of ways , including opening the vehicle 's doors , starting the engine , depressing the accelerator or brake pedals or simply lighting a fuse or setting a timing device . The gasoline in the vehicle 's fuel tank may make the explosion of the bomb more powerful by dispersing and igniting the fuel",

The road is part of the unsigned Euroroutes E20 ( Shannon to Saint Petersburg ) and E22 ( Holyhead to Ishim ) . The motorway , which was first proposed in the 1930s , and conceived as two separate routes , was opened in stages between 1971 and 1976 , with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing at that time in Tarbock on the outskirts of Liverpool . The motorway absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles bypass , which was built between 1957 and 1960 . Adjusted for inflation to 2007 , its construction cost approximately \u00a3765 million . The motorway has an average daily traffic flow of 144,000 vehicles in West Yorkshire , and has several areas prone to gridlock , in particular , between Leeds and Huddersfield and the M60 section around Eccles . The M62 coach bombing of 1974 and the Great Heck rail crash of 2001 are the largest incidents to have occurred on the M62 . Stott Hall Farm , situated between the carriageways on the Pennine section , has become one of the best-known sights on the motorway . The M62 has no junctions numbered 1 , 2 or 3 , or even an officially numbered 4 , because it was intended to start in Liverpool proper , not in its outskirts . Between Liverpool and Manchester , and east of Leeds , the terrain along which the road passes is relatively flat .

Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy .

Fletcher had been deployed to monitor a demonstration against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , and died shortly afterwards . Her death resulted in an eleven-day siege of the embassy , at the end of which those inside were expelled from the country and the United Kingdom severed diplomatic relations with Libya . Between 1980 and 1984 Gaddafi had ordered the deaths of several exiled opponents of his regime ; bombings and shootings , targeted at Libyan dissidents , occurred in Manchester and London . Five Libyans thought to be behind the attacks were deported from the UK . During the anti-Gaddafi protest on 17 April 1984 , two gunmen opened fire from the first floor of the embassy with Sterling submachine guns . In addition to the murder of Fletcher , eleven Libyan demonstrators were wounded . The inquest into Fletcher 's death reached a verdict that she was killed by a bullet coming from one of two windows on the west side of the front on the first floor of the Libyan People 's Bureau . Following the breaking of diplomatic relations , Libya arrested six British nationals , the last four of whom were released after nine months in captivity . Two years after Fletcher 's murder , the event became a factor in the decision by the British prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , to allow the US bombing of Libya from bases in the UK .

  "/wiki/Brighton": "Brighton ( /\u02c8bra\u026at\u0259n/ ) is a seaside resort in the county of East Sussex . It is a constituent part of the city of Brighton and Hove , created from the formerly separate towns of Brighton and Hove . Brighton is located on the south coast of England , positioned 47 miles ( 76 km ) south of London . Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age , Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods . The ancient settlement of Brighthelmstone was documented in the Domesday Book ( 1086 ) . The town 's importance grew in the Middle Ages as the Old Town developed , but it languished in the early modern period , affected by foreign attacks , storms , a suffering economy and a declining population . Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France . The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses . In the Georgian era , Brighton developed as a fashionable seaside resort , encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent , later King George IV , who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era . Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841 , becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London . Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era , including the Metropole Hotel ( now Hilton ) Grand Hotel , the West Pier , and the Brighton Palace Pier . The town continued to grow into the 20th century , expanding to incorporate more areas into the town 's boundaries before joining Hove to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove in 1997 , which was granted city status in 2000",

As Prime Minister , she implemented policies known as Thatcherism . Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College , Oxford , and worked briefly as a research chemist , before becoming a barrister . She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970-74 government .

On becoming Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election , she introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . [ nb 1 ] Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983 . She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984-85 miners ' strike",

Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto a residential street in Lockerbie , Scotland , killing 11 people on the ground . With a total of 270 people killed , it is the deadliest terror attack in the history of the United Kingdom . Following a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991 .

In 2003 , Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims , although he maintained that he had never given the order for the attack . Acceptance of responsibility was part of a series of requirements laid out by a UN resolution in order for sanctions against Libya to be lifted . Libya said it had to accept responsibility due to Megrahi 's status as a government employee",

  "/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building , located in Washington , D.C",

His co-accused , Lamin Khalifah Fhimah , was found not guilty and was acquitted . Megrahi unsuccessfully appealed his conviction in January 2001 . In June 2007 , the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission granted Megrahi leave to appeal against his Lockerbie bombing conviction for a second time . After initially appealing , Megrahi abandoned his second appeal in August 2009 as an ongoing appeal would have prevented him from being moved to Libya under the Prisoner Transfer Scheme which was thought to be a possibility . He decided to drop his appeal two days before he was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish Government on 20 August 2009 . Doctors reported on 10 August 2009 that he had terminal prostate cancer . On his return to Libya , al-Megrahi was initially hospitalized then allowed to leave on 2 November 2009 , taking up residence in a villa in Tripoli . He died on 20 May 2012 , two years and 9 months after his release . Several legal experts as well as the UN observer at the Lockerbie trial have vehemently challenged the verdict that convicted Megrahi , while Ulrich Lumpert , the Mebo AG engineer who testified to the validity of a key piece of evidence , admitted in an affidavit to lying in court and stealing the object from his employer , after which he gave it to one of the crime investigators",
