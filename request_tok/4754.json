The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942 .",

A republican , he contributed to the Italian unification and the creation of the Kingdom of Italy . He is considered one of the greatest generals of modern times and one of Italy 's fathers of the fatherland along with Camillo Benso , Count of Cavour , Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and Giuseppe Mazzini . Garibaldi is also known as the Hero of the Two Worlds because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe . Garibaldi was a follower of the Italian nationalist , Giuseppe Mazzini , and embraced republican nationalism as exemplified by the Young Italy movement . He became a life-long supporter of Italian unification under a democratic Republican government . After participating in an uprising in Piedmont , he was sentenced to death and he escaped by sailing to South America ; he spent fourteen years in exile , taking part in several wars and learning the art of guerrilla warfare . In 1835 , in Brazil , he took up the cause of the Riograndense Republic in its attempt to proclaim another republic within Santa Catarina , joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins . Garibaldi also became involved in the Uruguayan Civil War , raising an Italian force known as Redshirts , and is today celebrated as an important contributor towards the independence of the country . In 1848 , he returned to Italy and commanded and fought in many military campaigns that eventually led to the Italian unification . The provisional government of Milan made Garibaldi a general , and in 1849 , the Minister of War promoted him to General of the Roman Republic . When the war of independence broke out in April 1859 , he led his Hunters of the Alps in the capture of Varese and Como and reached the frontier of South Tyrol ; the war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy .",
  "/wiki/Italy_national_rugby_union_team": "The Italy national rugby union team is the representative national team in the sport of rugby union for the nation of Italy . The team is known as gli Azzurri ( the Blues ) . Savoy blue is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy , as it is the traditional colour of the royal House of Savoy which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1946 . Italy has played international rugby since 1929 , and for decades was considered one of the best European teams outside the Five Nations Championship . Since 2000 , Italy has competed annually in the Six Nations Championship with England , France , Ireland , Scotland and Wales . In 2013 , they were holders of the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy which is played annually between Italy and France . Italy is ranked 14th in the world by the IRB as of 30 September 2019 . Italian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations , creating the Six Nations . Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats , the side has grown in competitiveness , recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013 , and one-sided defeats have become less frequent . The Azzurri have shown respectable results when playing at home in recent years : they defeated France 22-21 in the 2011 Six Nations ; and during the 2013 Six Nations , they again beat France 23-18 , also defeating Ireland 22-15 . However , Italy has not won a Six Nations match since their 22-19 away win against Scotland in Round 3 of the 2015 tournament , losing every game since ; this equates to a losing run of 22 matches . The Italian team has also competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987 , where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand , but is yet to progress beyond the first round .",

Though he began his career as an attorney , after World War I , he became recognized as a skilled project manager in the restoration of a former German ocean liner for American use . In 1922 , in partnership with his brother Frederic Herbert Gibbs , he began the firm which would eventually become Gibbs & Cox ; they were among the major designers of World War II era warships and cargo vessels , including the Liberty ships and Fletcher-class destroyers . Gibbs was a pioneer in the areas of efficient hull design and propulsion , along with being an staunch advocate for high standards of fire prevention and hull integrity . Although the Liberty ships were designed with a priority of production simplicity and economy , other Gibbs designs tended to be sturdy , light , fast , safe , and enduring . In the late 1940s and early 1950s the Gibbs brothers were among the promoters leading the United States government and military to subsidize the cost of building the ultimate ocean liner . In the end Gibbs and Cox was awarded the contract to design and supervise the building of SS United States , which entered service in 1952 . While in the class of the largest liners , it was much lighter and considerably faster than contemporary vessels . It was built with a high emphasis on safety , using a minimum of flammable materials .",

  "/wiki/Minor_premiership": "A minor premiership is the name of the title given to the team which finishes a sporting competition first in the league standings after the regular season but prior to commencement of the playoffs in several Australian sports leagues . The etymology of the term was based on terminology in Australia from the end of the 19th century , where the regular season was referred to as the minor rounds , and the playoffs or finals were referred to as the major rounds ( this terminology is still used in South Australia , but has fallen into disuse in other parts of the country ) . Emerging from this terminology came the minor premiership , for the top-ranked team in the minor rounds , and the major premiership , often shortened simply to premiership , for the winner of the finals series . The term was important in the early finals systems of the Victorian Football League , an Australian rules football league , where the minor premier had the right to a challenge match for the major premiership if it were eliminated at any stage during the finals . The term is used widely throughout Australian sports , and there is often a separate trophy presented for it . The National Rugby League awards the J. J. Giltinan Shield , the Australian Ice Hockey League awards the H. Newman Reid Trophy and the Australian Football League has ( since 1991 ) awarded the Dr Wm . C. McClelland Trophy . The National Basketball League recognises the minor premiers but no official trophy or award is given . Australia 's premier association football competition , the A-League , officially refers to the minor premiership as the premiership , and the major premiership as the championship , which is more common with other association football competitions , but minor premiership is still used colloquially in the sports media even though it is incorrect terminology with regard to the A-League . Although the concept of a minor premiership exists in North America , and a separate award is often presented for the best record in the regular season , the term minor premiership is not used . The Presidents ' Trophy is awarded by the National Hockey League to the team which finishes first in the standings at the end of the season , as are the Supporters ' Shield in Major League Soccer and the NWSL Shield in the National Women 's Soccer League .",

It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42 % of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",

Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history , G\u00f6del had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century , a time when others such as Bertrand Russell , Alfred North Whitehead , and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor . G\u00f6del published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old , one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna . The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers ( for example Peano arithmetic ) , there are true propositions about the naturals that can not be proved from the axioms . To prove this theorem , G\u00f6del developed a technique now known as G\u00f6del numbering , which codes formal expressions as natural numbers . He also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory , assuming these axioms are consistent . The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs . He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic , intuitionistic logic , and modal logic .",
