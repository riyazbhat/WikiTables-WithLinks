The region was originally called Suomi ( Finland ) , which later became the name for the whole country . Turku , as a town , was never founded . The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city . As the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland , a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden . After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire ( 1809 ) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki ( 1812 ) . It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku ( Turun Akatemia ) founded in 1640 , which then became the University of Helsinki . Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s , and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port . Because of its long history , it has been the site of many important events , and has extensively influenced Finnish history .
