  "/wiki/District_of_Columbia's_at-large_congressional_district": "The District of Columbia 's at-large congressional district is a congressional district based entirely of the District of Columbia . According to the U.S. Constitution , only states may be represented in the Congress of the United States . The District of Columbia is not a U.S. state and therefore has no voting representation . Instead , constituents in the district elect a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives . Unlike residents of U.S. territories , who also elect non-voting delegates to the Congress , D.C. residents pay federal income tax , which essentially subjects them to taxation without representation . Despite lacking full voting privileges on the floor of the House of Representatives , delegates are voting members in U.S. Congressional committees and they lobby their congressional colleagues regarding the District 's interests . While the office was initially created during the Reconstruction Era by the Radical Republicans , Norton P. Chipman ( R ) briefly held the seat for less than two terms before the office was eliminated completely . The seat was re-created almost a century later , shortly before the 1970 elections ; Walter E. Fauntroy ( D ) won the 1971 special election the following March . Since 1993 , when the House of Representatives has been under Democratic control , delegates , including the District of Columbia 's delegate , have been allowed to cast non-binding floor votes when the House of Representatives was operating in the Committee of the Whole . The district is currently represented by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton .",

  "/wiki/US_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
