  "/wiki/Screen_One": "Screen One is a British television anthology drama series , produced by BBC Studios and distributed by BBC Worldwide , that transmitted on BBC1 between 1989 and 1994 . A total of six series were broadcast , incorporating sixty individual films , several of which were broadcast as stand-alone specials . The series was born following the demise of the BBC 's Play for Today , which ran from 1970 to 1984 . Producer Kenneth Trodd was asked to formulate a new series of one-off television dramas , the result of which was Screen Two , which began broadcasting on BBC2 in 1985 . However , while Play for Today 's style had often been a largely studio-based form of theatre on television , Screen Two was shot entirely on film . In 1989 , the series was adapted for more mainstream audiences on BBC1 , and Screen One was born to follow the lead taken by Channel 4 , whose many television films had later been released in Cinemas . Screen One attracted many names familiar to television and film audiences , including the likes of Alfred Molina , Sean Bean , David Thewlis , Ray Winstone , Alan Bates , Judi Dench , James Fox , Keith Allen , Bob Peck , Alun Armstrong , Marina Sirtis , David Jason , Brenda Blethyn , James Bolam , Adrian Edmondson , Alison Steadman , Timothy West , Clive Russell and Janet McTeer . Several actors also made their on-screen debuts during the series , including Keira Knightley in the fifth series episode Royal Celebration . By 1993 , the prevailing mood within the BBC was to move away from single dramas and concentrate production on series and serials , and as such , a reduced six-episode series , broadcast in 1994 , was to be the last full-length series of Screen One ; although a further eight , one-off specials followed , with the final episode being broadcast on 15 February 1998 .",
