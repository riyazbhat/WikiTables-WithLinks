It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers . The name Paran\u00e1 is an abbreviation of the phrase para rehe on\u00e1va , which comes from the Tupi language and means like the sea ( that is , as big as the sea ) . [ citation needed ] It merges first with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the R\u00edo de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean . The first European to go up the Paran\u00e1 River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot , in 1526 , while working for Spain",

It flows from north to south and forms parts of the boundaries of Brazil , Argentina , and Uruguay , separating some of the Argentine provinces of La Mesopotamia from the other two countries . It passes between the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil ; forms the eastern border of the provinces of Misiones , Corrientes , and Entre R\u00edos in Argentina ; and makes up the western borders of the departments of Artigas , Salto , Paysand\u00fa , R\u00edo Negro , Soriano , and Colonia in Uruguay",
  "/wiki/R\u00edo_Negro_(Argentina)": "R\u00edo Negro ( Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8ri.o \u02c8ne\u0263\u027eo ] ; Black River ) is the most important river of the Argentine province of R\u00edo Negro , and Patagonia in relation to its flow rate . Its name comes from the literal translation of the Mapuche term Curu Leuvu , although the water is more green than black . Formerly , it was also known as river of the willows because of the big number of weeping willows that grow along the bank . It 's 635 km in length . It originates from the junction of the Limay River and Neuqu\u00e9n River at the border with the Neuqu\u00e9n Province , and flows southeast to the Atlantic Ocean at 41\u00b001\u203220\u2033S 62\u00b047\u203225\u2033W / 41.0223\u00b0S 62.7903\u00b0W / -41.0223 ; -62.7903 , near El C\u00f3ndor beach resort some 30 km ( 19 mi ) downstream from Viedma , R\u00edo Negro province 's capital . The river allows the R\u00edo Negro province to produce 65 % of the pears and apples of Argentina . Besides irrigation , the river is also source of hydroelectricity with small dams on its course . The river served as natural demarcation between civilization and the aboriginal territories during the Conquest of the Desert of late 19th century",
  "/wiki/Bermejo_River": "The Bermejo River ( Spanish , R\u00edo Bermejo ) is a river in South America that flows from Bolivia to the Paraguay River in Argentina . The river is generally called Bermejo in spite of its different names along its way , but it also has its own Native American names ; in Wich\u00ed it is called Teuco , and in Guaran\u00ed it is called Ypit\u00e1 . In the plains of Argentina 's Gran Chaco the Bermejo forms wetlands and splits into two branches . The southern branch is the bed of the old Bermejo River , now an intermittent stream called R\u00edo Bermejito . The northern branch is now the main stem of the Bermejo and is called the Teuco River ( R\u00edo Teuco ) , Bermejo Nuevo , or simply the Bermejo River . The two branches rejoin at 25\u00b039\u2032S 60\u00b011\u2032W / 25.650\u00b0S 60.183\u00b0W / -25.650 ; -60.183 , near Villa R\u00edo Bermejito , forming the Lower Bermejo River .

At its highest part , its main tributaries are the Lipeo River , and further downstream the Grande de Tarija , the Iruya River , and the San Francisco River . It forms part of the international boundary between Argentina and Bolivia",

Along its course , the Pilcomayo silts up and splits into two main branches , North and South . After some distance , these branches rejoin to form the Lower Pilcomayo . The Pilcomayo rises in the foothills of the Andes mountain range in the Bolivian Oruro Department , east of Lake Poop\u00f3 . The Jach ' a Juqhu River is considered the origin of the Pilcomayo . Upstream the Jach ' a Juqhu River successively receives the names Aguas Calientes and Kachi Mayu . From the confluence with the Chillawa ( Chillahua ) , the river is called Pilcomayo . From there , it flows in a southeasterly direction through Chuquisaca and Tarija departments , passes through the Argentine province of Formosa and the Gran Chaco plains of Paraguay , forming the border between these two countries before it joins the Paraguay River near Asunci\u00f3n . The R\u00edo Pilcomayo National Park is located on the Argentine side of the border . It also forms a short part of the boundary between Argentina and Bolivia , just prior to the Argentina-Bolivia-Paraguay tripoint",

The Colorado River marks most of the political boundary between the Argentine provinces of Neuqu\u00e9n and Mendoza , and between Rio Negro and La Pampa .

The Salado 's mouth is about 170 kilometres ( 110 mi ) south of the city of Buenos Aires . The Salado 's drainage basin is about 170,000 square kilometres ( 66,000 sq mi ) , which is over half of the province 's area . The region receives an annual average of 2,000 millimetres ( 79 in ) of precipitation , which often causes flooding in the low-lying area . The river flows by the cities of Jun\u00edn , Roque P\u00e9rez , and General Belgrano , as well as a number of wetlands and lakes ; channelization of the lower course has improved the drainage of the river 's 88 cubic metres per second ( 3,100 cu ft/s ) . Nearly 1 million people live in the basin . Hydrological studies have been performed in the Salado basin , principally in the Azul , Buenos Aires creek basin by the Instituto de Hidrologia de Llanuras de Azul . Ecological studies have been done by the Ecology group of Facultad de Agronom\u00eda de la UNICEN . In the 19th century , before the Conquest of the Desert , the Salado River served as frontier boundary between the Spanish colonised lands and those still under control of the indigenous peoples . Because Argentina has another , more important Salado River , in the northern part of the country , this Salado River is sometimes called Salado del Sur ( Southern Salado )",

  "/wiki/Chubut_River": "The Chubut River ( Spanish : R\u00edo Chubut , Welsh : Afon Camwy ) is located in the Patagonia region of southern Argentina . Its name comes from the Tehuelche word chupat , which means transparent . The Argentine Chubut Province , through which the river flows , is named after it . Welsh settlers called the river Afon Camwy , meaning twisting river . The river is generally shallow and its water flow can vary from 4 to 400 cubic metres per second ( 140 to 14,130 cu ft/s ) between drought and flood . Average discharge is about 60 cubic metres per second ( 2,100 cu ft/s ) . Flooding made the lands beside the river fertile and important for agriculture . The river has great importance for the agricultural and general economy of the province . There were several attempts to create dams near the two townships of Rawson and Gaiman . The Chubut River has a very rare characteristic being higher than the land around it which is mostly arid . Wheat farming was the chief crop and mainstay of the agricultural and commercial resource of Patagonia . At this time the settlers were struggling with finance as they were using sterling , which was in very short supply",

The Desaguadero River has a total length of 1,498 km ( 931 mi ) and its drainage basin is about 260,000 km2 ( 100,000 sq mi ) . It is one of the major rivers that supplies the irrigated areas of Cuyo , and it flows in the eastern border of that region . Due to use of its waters for irrigation , the river is a small , shallow stream for most of the year despite its great length , and only occasionally does surface flow reach the Colorado .

  "/wiki/Deseado_River": "Deseado River ( Spanish : R\u00edo Deseado ) is a river in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz . The name Deseado comes from the English Desire , the name of one of the two ships commanded by John Davis during the Thomas Cavendish expedition of 1592 . The river is born from the glacier-thaw Buenos Aires Lake on the northwestern part of the province at the Andes range , and travels for 615 kilometres ( 382 mi ) before reaching the Atlantic Coast . On its way southeast , its water is tapped for irrigation . Its tributaries include the Pinturas River and the F\u00e9nix River . The river sometimes disappears under the arid terrain , to re-emerge before reaching Puerto Deseado on Santa Cruz 's coastline , where it produces a deep-water natural port . The outlet of the river has become submerged and inundated by sea water , forming an estuary . In 1977 , this was set aside as a nature reserve , the Reserva Natural R\u00eda Deseado"
