In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction .

Geographically , the bay covers 1,930 square kilometres ( 480,000 acres ) and the shore stretches roughly 264 km ( 164 mi ) . Although it is extremely shallow for its size , most of the bay is navigable . The deepest portion is only 24 metres ( 79 ft ) , and half the region is shallower than 8 m ( 26 ft ) . The volume of the water in the port is around 25 cubic kilometres ( 6.0 cu mi ) . Before European settlement the area around Port Phillip was divided between the territories of the Wathaurong ( to the west ) , Wurundjeri ( north ) and Boonwurrung ( south and east ) Nations . Its waters and coast are home to seals , whales , dolphins , corals , and many kinds of seabirds and migratory waders . The first Europeans to enter the bay were the crews of HMS Lady Nelson , commanded by John Murray and , ten weeks later , HMS Investigator commanded by Matthew Flinders , in 1802 . Subsequent expeditions into the bay took place in 1803 to establish the first settlement in Victoria , near Sorrento , but was abandoned in 1804 . Thirty years later , settlers from Tasmania returned to establish Melbourne , now the state 's capital city , at the mouth of the Yarra River in 1835 and Geelong at Corio Bay in 1838 . Today Port Phillip is the most densely populated catchment in Australia with an estimated 4.5 million people living around the bay ; Melbourne 's suburbs extend around much of the northern and eastern shorelines , and the city of Geelong sprawls around Corio Bay , in the bay 's western arm .",
