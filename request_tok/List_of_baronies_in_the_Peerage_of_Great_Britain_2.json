  "/wiki/Peerage_of_Scotland": "The Peerage of Scotland ( Scottish Gaelic : Moraireachd na h-Alba , Scots : Peerage o Scotland ) is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707 . Following that year 's Treaty of Union , the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain , and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created . After the Union , the Peers of the ancient Parliament of Scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords . The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords , but this automatic right was revoked , as for all hereditary peerages ( except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain ) , when the House of Lords Act 1999 received royal assent . Had the Scottish people voted Yes in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum , the eligibility of Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords would have been reviewed . Unlike most peerages , many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring ( thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh ) , and in the case of daughters only , these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance ( as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons ) . Unlike other British peerage titles , Scots Law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth , but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later . The ranks of the Scottish Peerage are , in ascending order : Lord of Parliament , Viscount , Earl , Marquis and Duke . Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other Peerages ( of England , Great Britain , Ireland and the United Kingdom ) by using the style of in their title , as in Viscount of Oxfuird . Though this is the theoretical form , most Viscounts drop the of . The Viscount of Arbuthnott and to a lesser extent the Viscount of Oxfuird still use of . Scottish Peers were entitled to sit in the ancient Parliament of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Marquess_of_Ailesbury": "Marquess of Ailesbury ( later styled Aylesbury ) , in the County of Buckingham , is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . It was created on 17 July 1821 for Charles Brudenell-Bruce , 2nd Earl of Ailesbury . On 18 March 1664 , Robert Bruce , 2nd Earl of Elgin in the Peerage of Scotland was created Baron Bruce , of Skelton in the County of York , Viscount Bruce , of Ampthill in the County of Bedford , and Earl of Ailesbury , in the County of Buckingham , all in the Peerage of England . His grandson , Charles , the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury ( and 4th Earl of Elgin ) , was created Baron Bruce , of Tottenham in the County of Wilts , on 17 April 1746 , in the Peerage of Great Britain , with a special remainder to his nephew , the Honourable Thomas Brudenell , fourth and youngest son of George Brudenell , 3rd Earl of Cardigan , by Lady Elizabeth Bruce , sister of the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury . On Lord Ailesbury 's death in 1747 , his English titles became extinct , except for the 1746 Barony of Bruce , which was inherited by his nephew , Robert , according to the special remainder . His Scottish titles passed to his kinsman , Charles Bruce , 5th Earl of Elgin . Thomas Brudenell , 2nd Baron Bruce , assumed the additional surname of Bruce by Royal licence in 1767 . On 10 June 1776 he was created Earl of Ailesbury , in the County of Buckingham , in the Peerage of Great Britain , a revival of the title which had become extinct on his uncle 's death 29 years earlier . His son , Charles Brudenell-Bruce , 2nd Earl of Ailesbury was created Viscount Savernake , of Savernake Forest in the County of Wilts , Earl Bruce , of Whorlton in the County of York , and Marquess of Ailesbury , in the County of Buckingham , on 17 July 1821 , all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . In 1838 his eldest son , George Brudenell-Bruce , 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury , was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father 's junior title of Baron Bruce . In 1868 the 2nd Marquess also inherited the Earldom of Cardigan from his kinsman the 7th Earl of Cardigan , and so the Marquesses of Ailesbury now also hold the titles Earl of Cardigan ( 1661 ) and Baron Brudenell , of Stonton in the County of Leicester ( 1628 ) , in the Peerage of England , as well as being Baronets of England , styled of Deene in the County of Northampton . The 2nd Marquess was succeeded by his younger brother , Ernest Brudenell-Bruce , 3rd Marquess of Ailesbury , who had previously sat in the House of Commons for 46 years under the name of Lord Ernest Bruce ."
