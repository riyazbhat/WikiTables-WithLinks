The athletics was , alongside the Olympic cycling events , one of the few large sports programmes in which the host nation fared comparatively poorly in terms of medals won . Despite a haul of 100 medals at the games as a whole , Chinese athletes took home two bronze medals from the athletics events . The country 's foremost athlete Liu Xiang , the 2004 Olympic champion in the 110 metres hurdles , had to withdraw after a false start due to injury . In the years following the events , results were significantly affected by doping findings ; 19 of the 47 events have had amendments to their medal rankings as a result of testing and retesting of samples taken at or before the Games .

With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital .",

Veteran athlete Virgilijus Alekna , the last athlete to beat Kanter in competition , was a strong medal possibility . Olympic silver medallist Piotr Malachowski was another contender , as was German Robert Harting who won silver at the previous world championships .

Consistently throwing better than the rest of the field , Harting and Malachowski battled for the top spot . The Pole improved his lead with 69.15 m in the fifth round , another national record , but Harting took the gold with his final throw of the competition , recording a personal best of 69.43 m. The victory for the home athlete was marred by his controversial comments regarding an initiative by victims of doping in East Germany .
