With a population of 4,007,526 , Amman is the largest city in the Levant region and the fifth-largest city in the Arab world . It is considered to be among the most modernized Arab cities and a major tourist destination . The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal , where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered . During the Iron Age , the city was known as Ammon , home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites . It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods , and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period . Abandoned for much of the medieval and post-medieval period , modern Amman dates to the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in 1867 . The first municipal council was established in 1909 . Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan 's capital in 1921 , and after several successive waves of refugees : Palestinians in 1948 and 1967 ; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003 ; and Syrians since 2011 . It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 27 districts , which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh . Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills ( Jabal ) or the valleys ( Wadi ) they occupy , such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun . East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities , while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city .",

  "/wiki/Exhibition_game": "An exhibition game ( also known as a friendly , a scrimmage , a demonstration , a preseason game , a warmup match , or a preparation match , depending at least in part on the sport ) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player 's or the team 's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced . In team sports , matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament . If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues , exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other . The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team . An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge , to provide professional entertainment , to promote the sport , to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player , or to raise money for charities . Several sports leagues hold all-star games to showcase their best players against each other , while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world . International competitions like the Olympic Games may also hold exhibition games as part of a demonstration sport .",

  "/wiki/Ta'Qali": "Ta ' Qali is a wide open space in the limits of Attard in central Malta , which contains the national football stadium , Ta ' Qali National Park , a crafts village , and a national vegetable market which is locally known as the Pitkalija . Shortly before World War II , the area was used to build a military aerodrome and a station for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , which the British called RAF Ta Kali ; Maltese place names were often corrupted in this fashion . RAF Ta Kali was operational throughout the war and continued to be used as an RAF airfield until the mid-1950s . Latterly , RAF squadrons based in the United Kingdom visited Ta Kali as part of their annual proficiency training . Since the departure of the RAF and the closure of the air base , the location has been transformed into a recreational area . The area is small in scale but considered by some in Malta as an ideal place to go for a picnic and spend weekend afternoons . The National Park also includes an amphitheatre . A number of international concerts have been staged at the park . The newly built US Embassy stands across from the Ta'Qali National Park . In July , 2011 the embassy relocated to Ta'Qali from Floriana where it stood for nearly fifty years . Ta ' Qali still fulfils part of its former role as an airfield but the only aircraft that take off from the greatly diminished landing strip are scale models , whose owners make part of a club located in Ta ' Qali . Today , many of the military huts and buildings have been converted into workshops where Maltese craftsmen produce their handiwork , and the Ta ' Qali Crafts Village has become an important tourist attraction .",
