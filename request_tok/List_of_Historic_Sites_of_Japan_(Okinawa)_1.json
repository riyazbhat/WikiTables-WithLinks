It is located on the grounds of Shuri Castle in Naha , Okinawa , a few paces away from the Shureimon castle gate . The utaki , or more specifically its stone gate ( \u77f3\u9580 , ishimon ) , is one of a number of sites which together comprise the UNESCO World Heritage Site officially described as Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu , and has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese national government . While the gates were once opened only for the king , today they are always closed , and so the gates have in a way become a sacred space themselves , representative of the actual sacred space behind them . Many travellers and locals come to pray at the gates . The stone gate was first built in 1519 , during the reign of Ryukyuan king Sh\u014d Shin , though the space had been recognized as a sacred utaki prior to that . Whenever the king left the castle on a journey , he would first stop at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for safe travels . The site also played an important role in the initiation of the High Priestess ( \u805e\u5f97\u5927\u541b , kikoe-\u014dgimi ) of the native religion . The gate is said to be a prime example of traditional Okinawan architecture , and shows many signs of Chinese influence , along with a Japanese-influenced gable in the karahafu style . It was severely damaged in the 1945 battle of Okinawa , but was restored in 1957 , and officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 , along with a number of other sites across Okinawa Island . The utaki , i.e . the sacred grove itself , was once much larger than it is today , an elementary school and other buildings having encroached upon the space",
