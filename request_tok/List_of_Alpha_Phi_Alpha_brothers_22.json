  "/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion",
  "/wiki/Swann_v._Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education": "Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education , 402 U.S. 1 ( 1971 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools . The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools , even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race . This was done to ensure the schools would be properly integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race . Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Brown v. Board of Education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate . In 1963 , the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration , and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation [ citation needed ] . In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation ; thus , it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools . In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education ( 1969 ) , Judge Frank Johnson 's desegregation order for teachers was upheld , allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge",

After escaping from slavery in Maryland , he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York , gaining note for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings . In his time , he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders ' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens . Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave . Douglass wrote several autobiographies . He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography , Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , an American Slave , which became a bestseller , and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition , as was his second book , My Bondage and My Freedom ( 1855 ) . After the Civil War , Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography , Life and Times of Frederick Douglass . First published in 1881 and revised in 1892 , three years before his death , it covered events during and after the Civil War . Douglass also actively supported women 's suffrage , and held several public offices .

Born in Great Barrington , Massachusetts , Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community , and after completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard , where he was the first African American to earn a doctorate , he became a professor of history , sociology and economics at Atlanta University . Due to his contributions in the African-American community he was seen as a member of a Black elite that supported some aspects of eugenics for blacks . Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) in 1909 . Before that , Du Bois had risen to national prominence as the leader of the Niagara Movement , a group of African-American activists that wanted equal rights for blacks . Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise , an agreement crafted by Booker T. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule , while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities . Instead , Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation , which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite . He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth , a concept under the umbrella of Racial uplift , and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership . Racism was the main target of Du Bois 's polemics , and he strongly protested against lynching , Jim Crow laws , and discrimination in education and employment . His cause included people of color everywhere , particularly Africans and Asians in colonies . He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers .

  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) .

After being denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law because he was African American , and refusing the university 's offer to pay for him to attend a neighboring state 's law school that had no racial restriction , Gaines filed suit . The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in his favor , holding that the separate but equal doctrine required that Missouri either admit him or set up a separate law school for black students . The Missouri General Assembly chose the latter option . It authorized conversion of a former cosmetology school in St. Louis to establish the Lincoln University School of Law , to which other , mostly black , students were admitted . The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , which had supported Gaines 's suit , planned to file another one challenging the adequacy of the new law school . While waiting for classes to begin , Gaines traveled between St. Louis , Kansas City and Chicago looking for work . He worked odd jobs and gave speeches before local NAACP chapters . One night in Chicago he left the fraternity house , where he was staying , to buy stamps , and never returned . He was never seen again by anyone who knew or recognized him and reported doing so .

  "/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States",
