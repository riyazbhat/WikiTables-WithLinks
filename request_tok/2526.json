The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons .
