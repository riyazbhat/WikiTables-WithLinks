It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes , who compose a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory . South Dakota is the seventeenth largest by area , but the fifth smallest by population and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States . As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory , South Dakota became a state on November 2 , 1889 , simultaneously with North Dakota . Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls , with a population of about 187,200 , is South Dakota 's largest city . South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota ( to the north ) , Minnesota ( to the east ) , Iowa ( to the southeast ) , Nebraska ( to the south ) , Wyoming ( to the west ) , and Montana ( to the northwest ) . The state is bisected by the Missouri River , dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves , known to residents as East River and West River . Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state 's population , and the area 's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops . West of the Missouri River , ranching is the predominant agricultural activity , and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending . Most of the Native American reservations are in West River . The Black Hills , a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux , are in the southwest part of the state .

The state 's capital and largest city is Boise . Idaho prior to European settlement was inhabited by Native American peoples , some of whom still live in the area . In the early 19th century , Idaho was considered part of the Oregon Country , an area disputed between the U.S. and the United Kingdom . It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 , but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863 , instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory . Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3 , 1890 , becoming the 43rd state . Forming part of the Pacific Northwest ( and the associated Cascadia bioregion ) , Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions . The state 's north , the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle , is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone - the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone .

It is also known informally by its nickname , The Sooner State , in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 , which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory . Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 . With ancient mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers , and the U.S . Interior Highlands , all regions prone to severe weather . Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for Southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans . More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma . A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agricultural products , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology . Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas .",

This re-monumentation was performed by staff from the BLM , members of the Arizona Professional Surveyors Society , and students at Phoenix College . The initial point was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( listing # 02001137 ) as of October 15 , 2002 . The plaque for that listing was installed as part of the 2006 re-monumenting .",

It is also part of the Western and the Mountain states . It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states . Its capital and largest city is Phoenix . Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah , Colorado , and New Mexico ; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest . Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union , achieving statehood on February 14 , 1912 , coinciding with Valentine 's Day . Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain , it became part of independent Mexico in 1821 . After being defeated in the Mexican-American War , Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848 . The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase . Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate , with very hot summers and mild winters . Northern Arizona features forests of pine , Douglas fir , and spruce trees ; the Colorado Plateau ; mountain ranges ( such as the San Francisco Mountains ) ; as well as large , deep canyons , with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls . There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff , Alpine , and Tucson .",

The state 's capital is Baton Rouge , and its largest city is New Orleans . Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp . [ self-published source ] These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets . There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish . In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas . These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants .

  "/wiki/Michigan_Meridian": "The Michigan meridian is the principal meridian ( or north-south line ) used as a reference in the Michigan Survey , the survey of the U.S. state of Michigan in the early 19th century . It is located at 84 degrees , 21 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude at its northern terminus at Sault Ste . Marie , and varies very little from that line down the length of the state . [ citation needed ] The meridian was surveyed by Benjamin Hough in April 1815 . The meridian was selected because it formed one of the principal boundary lines defined in the Treaty of Detroit in 1807 , which was the first large cession of land by Native American peoples to the United States in the Michigan Territory . In that treaty , the boundary line was described as running due north from the mouth of the Auglaize River on the Maumee River , which was the site of Fort Defiance ( now Defiance , Ohio ) . Michigan 's baseline , which today forms the northern border of Wayne , Washtenaw and other counties , was surveyed at the same time by Alexander Holmes . Although regulations governing the U.S. Public Land Survey System would later specify that the baseline should be a true parallel of latitude , this was not the case in earlier surveys , including the Michigan survey . Some roadways were laid out for both survey lines , but there was no intersecting of roadways coinciding with the intersecting of survey lines . Several segments of the Michigan Meridian correspond with a road bearing the name Meridian Road . The Michigan meridian forms the boundary between several counties in Michigan : Lenawee and Hillsdale ; Shiawassee and Clinton ; Saginaw and Gratiot ; Ogemaw and Roscommon ; Oscoda and Crawford ; Montmorency and Otsego ; and a portion of the boundary between Chippewa and Mackinac . U.S. Highway 127 approximately follows the meridian from the Ohio border into Jackson .",

The Arizona lands surveyed using the Navajo meridian and baseline were ranges six west to ten west and townships one north to fourteen north , and included Canyon de Chelly National Monument . While the above-mentioned Arizona lands still reference the Navajo meridian and baseline , in New Mexico the surveys of lands originally surveyed under it were canceled in 1936 , and have since been resurveyed using the New Mexico meridian and baseline . In Arizona , only the portions of the Navajo Reservation that are east of the Hopi Reservation were surveyed using the Navajo meridian and baseline ."
