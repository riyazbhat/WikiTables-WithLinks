It is designated as a historic district by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation . In 1984 , the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation succeeded in having a section of East Washington consisting of 120 Victorian houses added to the National Register of Historic Places . Washington & Jefferson College was opposed to the designation , but filed an objection too late in the proceedings . College President Howard J. Burnett said that the district was structured to prevent expansion of the college . At issue was the college 's plan to expand eastward towards the Wade Avenue area , a plan that was developed in the 1968 Master Plan . Since then , the college has had a policy of purchasing homes in that area when they become available . The college has purchased and demolished a number of buildings listed in the historic district , including 308 , 314 and 322 E. Wheeling Street , which made way for the Burnett Center . A 140-year-old farm house at 137 South Wade Street was acquired by the college in 1977 after being vacant for several years and moved to a new location . As of 1995 , the college owned about 30 properties listed in the historic district",
