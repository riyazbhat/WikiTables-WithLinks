  "/wiki/Mountain": "A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing and skiing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Summit_(topography)": "A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it . The topographic terms acme , apex , peak ( mountain peak ) , and zenith are synonymous . The term top ( mountain top ) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation . For example , a big massive rock then to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit . Summits near a higher peak , with some prominence or isolation , but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities , are often considered subsummits ( or subpeaks ) of the higher peak , and are considered part of the same mountain . A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top . Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line , trail , or route . The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8844.43 m above sea level ( 29,029 ft ) . The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary . They reached the mountain 's peak in 1953 . Whether a highest point is classified as a summit , a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective . The UIAA definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres ( 98 ft ) or more ; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres ( 980 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Peru": "The administrative divisions of Peru have changed from time to time since the nation gained independence from Spain in the early 19th century . The old territorial subdivisions have split or merged due to several reasons , the most common ones being the need for decentralization and population increase , especially in Lima .",
  "/wiki/Mountain_range": "A mountain range or hill range is a series of mountains or hills ranged in a line and connected by high ground . A mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form , structure , and alignment that have arisen from the same cause , usually an orogeny . Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes , but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics . Mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets . Mountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys . Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology . They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes , for example thrust sheets , uplifted blocks , fold mountains , and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types .",

  "/wiki/Coropuna": "Coropuna is a dormant compound volcano located in the Andes mountains of southeast-central Peru whose upper reaches consist of several perennially snowbound conical summits .

Ampato consists of three volcanic cones , which lie on top of an older eroded volcanic edifice . They were formed sequentially by extrusion of lava flows , but Ampato has also had explosive eruptions which have deposited ash , lapilli and pumice in the surrounding landscape . One young lava flow has been dated to 17,000 \u00b1 6,000 years before present , but a summit lava dome is even younger , and Holocene ash layers in surrounding peat bogs may testify to the occurrence of recent eruptions . The present-day volcano is covered by an ice cap , and during the last glacial maximum glaciers advanced to low altitudes .
