A recipient of two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards , five first-team All-Pro selections , and ten Pro Bowl appearances , Greene is widely considered to be the one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the NFL .

Born and raised in Temple , Texas , Greene attended North Texas State University ( now University of North Texas ) , where he earned consensus All-America honors as a senior playing for the North Texas State Mean Green football team . He was drafted by the Steelers fourth overall in the 1969 NFL Draft and made an immediate impact with the team , as he was named the NFL 's Defensive Rookie of the Year . Greene is credited with providing the foundation upon which Steelers coach Chuck Noll turned the dismal franchise into a sports dynasty . He was the centerpiece of the Steel Curtain defense that led Pittsburgh to four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span . Throughout his career , Greene was one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL , able to overpower opposing offensive linemen with ease and disrupt blocking .

He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame , and his number 75 jersey is one of only two retired by the Steelers .

Although considered a turning point in the team 's history , the results were not immediate ; after winning the season opener against the Detroit Lions , the Steelers lost every game afterwards to finish 1-13 . The Steelers became the first team in NFL history since the 1936 Philadelphia Eagles to win its season opener and lose every remaining game , a feat not matched until 2001 when the Carolina Panthers won its season opener against Minnesota before losing every game en route to a 1-15 finish . The Steelers finished 1969 4th in the NFL Century Division and tied with the Chicago Bears for last in the NFL . With the Steelers finishing 1-6 at Pitt Stadium , it marked the last time the Steelers finished the season with a losing record at home until 1999 . As a result of their 1-13 records , Art Rooney of the Steelers won a coin toss with George Halas of the Bears to determine who would select Louisiana Tech quarterback Terry Bradshaw ( the consensus number 1 selection among league teams ) with the number one pick in the 1970 draft . By modern NFL tiebreaking rules , the Steelers would have automatically been given the first pick anyway , as the Bears ' one win came against the Steelers in Week 8 .",

Taylor played his entire professional career as a linebacker for the New York Giants ( 1981-1993 ) in the National Football League ( NFL ) . He is considered one of the greatest players in the history of American football , and has been ranked as the greatest defensive player in league history by former players , coaches , media members , and news outlets such as the NFL Network and Sporting News . After an All-American career at the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) ( 1978-1981 ) , Taylor was drafted by the Giants as the second overall selection in the 1981 NFL Draft . Although controversy surrounded the selection due to Taylor 's contract demands , the two sides quickly resolved the issue . Taylor won several defensive awards after his rookie season . Taylor is both the first and currently only NFL player to win the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in his rookie season . Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s , Taylor was a disruptive force at outside linebacker , and is credited with changing defensive game plans , defensive pass rushing schemes , offensive line blocking schemes , and offensive formations used in the NFL . Taylor produced double-digit sacks each season from 1984 through 1990 , including a career-high of 20.5 in 1986 . He also won a record three AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards and was named the league 's Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) for his performance during the 1986 season . Taylor is one of only two defensive players in the history of the NFL to have ever won the NFL MVP award ( the other one being Alan Page in 1971 ) and no defensive player has won since him .

Eight teams from each conference were seeded 1-8 based on their regular season records . Two teams qualified for the playoffs despite losing records ( the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions ) .

The jury ruled that the NFL violated antitrust laws when it declined to approve the proposed move by the team from Oakland to Los Angeles . Thus , the league was forced to let the officially renamed Los Angeles Raiders play in the second largest city in the United States , returning football to the Los Angeles area proper following a two-year absence ( the Los Angeles Rams left the Coliseum for Anaheim Stadium in Orange County in 1980 ) . For the start of the 1982 season , the Minnesota Vikings moved from Metropolitan Stadium to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome .",
