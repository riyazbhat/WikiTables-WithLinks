The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat , and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 ( as a result of constant fighting between the brothers ) . Their third single , the Ray Davies-penned You Really Got Me , became an international hit , topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States . Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres , including rhythm and blues , American rock and roll , British music hall , folk , and country . They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle , fuelled by Ray Davies ' wittily observational writing style , and are considered one of the most influential groups of the period . Early works included albums such as Face to Face ( 1966 ) , Something Else ( 1967 ) , The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society ( 1968 ) , Arthur ( 1969 ) , Lola Versus Powerman ( 1970 ) , and Muswell Hillbillies ( 1971 ) , along with their accompanying singles .
