  "/wiki/The_Hobbit_(1982_video_game)": "The Hobbit is an illustrated text adventure computer game released in 1982 for the ZX Spectrum home computer and based on the book The Hobbit , by J. R. R. Tolkien . It was developed at Beam Software by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler and published by Melbourne House . It was later converted to most home computers available at the time including the Commodore 64 , BBC Micro and Oric computers . By arrangement with the book publishers , a copy of the book was included with each game sold . The parser was very advanced for the time and used a subset of English called Inglish . When it was released , most adventure games used simple verb-noun parsers ( allowing for simple phrases like get lamp ) , but Inglish allowed the player to type advanced sentences such as ask Gandalf about the curious map then take sword and kill troll with it . The parser was complex and intuitive , introducing pronouns , adverbs ( viciously attack the goblin ) , punctuation and prepositions and allowing the player to interact with the game world in ways not previously possible .",

  "/wiki/Amstrad_CPC": "The Amstrad CPC ( short for Colour Personal Computer ) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990 . It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",
  "/wiki/ZX_Spectrum": "The ZX Spectrum ( UK : /z\u025bd \u025bks/ ) is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research . Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82 , it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine 's colour display , compared with the black and white display of its predecessor , the ZX81 . The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . The Spectrum was among the first mainstream-audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen . Some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry . The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric-1 , Oric Atmos , BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s . While the machine was officially discontinued in 1992 , new software titles continue to be released - over 40 were released in 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",
  "/wiki/BBC_Micro": "The British Broadcasting Corporation Microcomputer System , or BBC Micro , is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company in the 1980s for the BBC Computer Literacy Project , operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation . Designed with an emphasis on education , it was notable for its ruggedness , expandability , and the quality of its operating system . An accompanying 1982 television series , The Computer Programme , featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine , was broadcast on BBC2 . After the Literacy Project 's call for bids for a computer to accompany the TV programmes and literature , Acorn won the contract with the Proton , a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice . Renamed the BBC Micro , the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom , changing Acorn 's fortunes . It was also successful as a home computer in the UK , despite its high cost . Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which , many years later , has become hugely successful for embedded systems , including tablets and cellphones . In 2013 ARM was the most widely used 32-bit instruction set architecture . While nine models were eventually produced with the BBC brand , the phrase BBC Micro is usually used colloquially to refer to the first six ( Model A , B , B+64 , B+128 , Master 128 , and Master Compact ) , excluding the Acorn Electron ; subsequent BBC models are considered part of Acorn 's Archimedes series .",

Parker Brothers was set to publish it , and advertised it in their 1982 and 1983 catalogues as a game that would be released on the Atari 2600 and Atari Home Computer . The game was originally advertised under the name Lord of the Rings , and in one case as The Lord of the Rings I . It was described as an adventure of getting Frodo from the Shire to the door at Moria , a description which was later changed in the 1983 Parker Brothers Video Games catalogue to have Rivendell as the adventures end point instead . The same catalogue was first time the game was ever referred to as The Lord of the Rings : Journey to Rivendell , and was the last advertisement the game ever received . The game was never released , and it was believed that little or no work was done on the game 's coding . Almost twenty years after The Lord of the Rings : Journey to Rivendell was first announced , in the weeks leading up to the much anticipated release of the first live-action movie , a former Parker Brothers employee gave a prototype of the game to the operator of the AtariAge website . Surprisingly , the game was quite complex and seemed to be complete . The game 's objective is to travel as Frodo from the Shire to Rivendell while avoiding The Black Riders . If Frodo is caught by The Black Riders , he will be sent backwards from Rivendell and will be wounded . If Frodo is wounded too many times , or fails to reach Rivendell within 7 days , the game ends . As time passes the Nazg\u00fbl become faster and harder for Frodo to avoid , especially at night .",

  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry .

When it was launched the cost of a PCW system was under 25% of the cost of almost all IBM-compatible PC systems in the UK , and as a result the machine was very popular both in the UK and in Europe , persuading many technophobes to venture into using computers . However the last two models , introduced in the mid-1990s , were commercial failures , being squeezed out of the market by the falling prices , greater capabilities and wider range of software for IBM-compatible PCs . In all models , including the last , the monitor 's casing included the CPU , RAM , floppy disk drives and power supply for all of the systems ' components . All except the last included a printer in the price . Early models used 3-inch floppy disks , while those sold from 1991 onwards used 3\u00bd-inch floppies , which became the industry standard around the time the PCW series was launched .
