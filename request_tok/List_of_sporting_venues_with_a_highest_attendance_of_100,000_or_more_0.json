Variations include restricting races to particular breeds , running over obstacles , running over different distances , running on different track surfaces and running in different gaits .

Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 .

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend .
