  "/wiki/Miami_metropolitan_area": "The Miami metropolitan area , also known as the Greater Miami Area or South Florida , is the 72nd largest metropolitan area in the world and the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States . Located in southern Florida with 6,198,782 inhabitants as of 2018 , the Miami metropolitan area is the most populous in Florida and second largest in the southeastern United States . It extends about 120 miles ( 190 km ) from north to south . The metropolitan area is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach , FL ( MSA ) , consisting of Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties , a metropolitan statistical area used for statistical purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other agencies . Its land area is 6,137 sq . mi ( 15,890 km2 ) . Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties are the first , second , and third most populous counties in Florida , and Miami-Dade , with 2,761,581 people in 2018 , is the seventh most populous county in the United States . The three counties together are known as the Greater Miami Area and have principal cities including Miami , Fort Lauderdale , West Palm Beach , Hialeah , Pembroke Pines and Boca Raton . Besides its association with the South Florida region , which includes the Everglades and the Florida Keys , it is also synonymous with an area known collectively as the Gold Coast . The Census Bureau also defines a wider region based on commuting patterns , the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. Lucie , FL Combined Statistical Area ( CSA ) , with an estimated population of 6,723,472 in 2016 . This includes the four additional counties of Martin , St. Lucie , Indian River , and Okeechobee . Because the population of South Florida is largely confined to a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades , the Miami urbanized area ( that is , the area of contiguous urban development ) is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) long ( north to south ) , but never more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide , and in some areas only 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) wide ( east to west )",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_II": "The second AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional football , known retroactively as Super Bowl II , was played on January 14 , 1968 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida . The National Football League ( NFL ) 's defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33-14 . This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium . Coming into this game , like during the first Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL . The Packers , the defending champions , posted a 9-4-1 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys , 21-17 , in the 1967 NFL Championship Game ( also popularly known as the Ice Bowl ) . The Raiders finished the 1967 AFL season at 13-1 , and defeated the Houston Oilers , 40-7 , in the 1967 AFL Championship Game . As expected , Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II . The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback Daryle Lamonica . Meanwhile , Packers kicker Don Chandler made four field goals , including three in the first half , while defensive back Herb Adderley had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was named the MVP for the second straight time , becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_III": "Super Bowl III was the third AFL-NFL Championship Game in professional American football , and the first to officially bear the trademark name Super Bowl . Played on January 12 , 1969 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the game is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in both American football history and in the recorded history of sports . The 18-point underdog American Football League ( AFL ) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League ( NFL ) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-7 . This was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL . Before the game , most sports writers and fans believed that AFL teams were less talented than NFL clubs , and expected the Colts to defeat the Jets by a wide margin . Baltimore posted a 13-1 record in the regular season and shut out the Cleveland Browns 34-0 in the NFL Championship Game . The Jets were 11-3 in the regular season , and defeated the Oakland Raiders 27-23 in the AFL Championship Game . Jets quarterback Joe Namath famously made an appearance three days before the Super Bowl at the Miami Touchdown Club and personally guaranteed his team 's victory . His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game , building a 16-0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner . Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas , who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown , during the last few minutes of the game . With the victory , the Jets were the only winning team to score only one touchdown ( either offensive , defensive , or special teams ) until the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII . Namath , who completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards , was named as the Super Bowl 's most valuable player , making him the first player in Super Bowl history to be declared MVP without personally scoring or throwing for a touchdown",

The Colts defeated the Cowboys by the score of 16-13 on a field goal with 5 seconds left in the game . The game was played on January 17 , 1971 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the first Super Bowl game played on artificial turf , on first-generation Poly-Turf . This was the first Super Bowl played after the completion of the AFL-NFL merger . Beginning with this game and continuing to the present day , the Super Bowl has served as the NFL 's league championship game , with the winner of the AFC Championship Game and the winner of the NFC Championship Game facing off in the culmination of the NFL playoffs . As per the merger agreement , all 26 AFL and NFL teams were divided into two conferences with 13 teams in each . Along with the Colts , the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the AFC ; the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC . This explains why the Colts represented the NFL in Super Bowl III , but the AFC for Super Bowl V. Baltimore advanced to Super Bowl V after posting an 11-2-1 regular season record . Meanwhile , the Cowboys were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting a 10-4 regular season record . The game is sometimes called the Blunder Bowl , Blooper Bowl , or Stupor Bowl because it was filled with poor play , a missed PAT , penalties , turnovers , and officiating miscues . The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers , with five in the fourth quarter . The Colts ' seven turnovers remain the most committed by a Super Bowl champion",

The game was played at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , on January 18 , 1976 , one of the first major national events of the United States Bicentennial year . Both the pre-game and halftime show celebrated the Bicentennial , while players on both teams wore special patches on their jerseys with the Bicentennial logo . Super Bowl X featured a contrast of playing styles between the Steelers and the Cowboys , which were , at the time , the two most popular teams in the league . The Steelers , dominating teams with their Steel Curtain defense and running game , finished the regular season with a league best 12-2 record and defeated the Baltimore Colts and the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs . The Cowboys , with their offense and flex defense , became the first NFC wild-card team to advance to the Super Bowl after posting a 10-4 regular season record and postseason victories over the Minnesota Vikings and the Los Angeles Rams . Trailing 10-7 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X , the Steelers rallied to score 14 unanswered points , including a 64-yard touchdown reception by Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann .

Bradshaw eclipsed Bart Starr 's Super Bowl record for passing yards in the first half with 253 yards in the air as the Steelers led 21-14 at intermission . His 75-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter also tied Johnny Unitas in Super Bowl V for the longest pass in a Super Bowl .

Dallas also could not overcome turnovers , drops , and a controversial penalty during the second half .

The 49ers defeated the Chargers by the score of 49-26 , becoming the first team to win five Super Bowl championships . The game was played on January 29 , 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami , Florida ( now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens , which became a separate city in 2003 ) .

With Young at the helm , and a defense consisting of several veteran free agents who joined the team during the previous offseason , San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13-3 record , and led the league in total points scored ( 505 ) . The Chargers , on the other hand , were regarded as a Cinderella team , and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11-5 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins . This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters . The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total touchdowns both remain Super Bowl records .

The Chargers were able to cut the deficit late in the first quarter , 14-7 , on a 13-play , 78-yard drive , but could not slow down San Francisco afterwards . Young was named the Super Bowl MVP , throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes , and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards . Despite the predicted blowout ( 18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl ) , the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base , and two teams from California playing , which could have significantly diminished interest along the East Coast , the telecast of the game on ABC still had a Nielsen rating of 41.3",

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80 % of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50 % . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population",

This victory by the AFL squared the Super Bowl series with the NFL at two games apiece as the two leagues merged into one after the game . Despite the AFL 's New York Jets winning the previous season 's Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans thought it was a fluke and continued to believe that the NFL was still superior to the AFL , and thus fully expected the Vikings to defeat the Chiefs ; the Vikings entered the Super Bowl as 12\u00bd to 13\u00bd-point favorites .

The Bears defeated the Patriots by the score of 46-10 , capturing their first NFL championship since 1963 , three years prior to the birth of the Super Bowl . Super Bowl XX was played on January 26 , 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans . This was the fourth Super Bowl and , to date , the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts . The Bears entered the game after becoming the second team in NFL history to win 15 regular season games . With their then-revolutionary 46 defense , Chicago led the league in several defensive categories , outscored their opponents with a staggering margin of 456-198 , and recorded two postseason shutouts . The Patriots were considered a Cinderella team during the 1985 season , and posted an 11-5 regular season record , but entered the playoffs as a wild card because of tiebreakers . But defying the odds , New England posted three road playoff wins to advance to Super Bowl XX . In their victory over the Patriots , the Bears set or tied Super Bowl records for sacks ( seven ) , fewest rushing yards allowed ( seven ) , and margin of victory ( 36 points ) . At the time , New England broke the record for the quickest lead in Super Bowl history , with Tony Franklin 's 36-yard field goal 1:19 into the first quarter after a Chicago fumble . But the Patriots were eventually held to negative yardage ( \u221219 ) throughout the entire first half , and finished with just 123 total yards from scrimmage , the second lowest total yards in Super Bowl history , behind the Minnesota Vikings ( 119 total yards ) in Super Bowl IX .

The 49ers finished the 1989 regular season with a league best 14-2 record . The Broncos , who posted an 11-5 regular season record , entered the Super Bowl looking to avoid tying the Minnesota Vikings with four Super Bowl losses as well as the Vikings record of losing three Super Bowls in four years . This game remains the most lopsided game in Super Bowl history . San Francisco 's 55 points were the most ever scored by one team , and their 45-point margin of victory was the largest ever . The 49ers are also the only team to score at least eight touchdowns in a Super Bowl and at least two touchdowns in each quarter ( the only mistake was a missed extra point attempt ) . San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana was named the Super Bowl MVP , his third award in his fourth Super Bowl victory . He completed 22 of 29 passes for a total of 297 yards and a Super Bowl record 5 touchdowns , while also rushing for 15 yards .

The game was played on January 26 , 1997 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . This Super Bowl featured two clubs that had recently returned to competitiveness .

The pregame ceremonies and the halftime show headlined by the Irish rock band U2 honored the victims of 9/11 . Due to heightened security measures following the terrorist attacks , this was the first Super Bowl designated as a National Special Security Event ( NSSE ) by the Office of Homeland Security ( OHS ) . The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , which replaced the OHS in 2003 , later established the practice of naming each subsequent Super Bowl an NSSE .

In addition , Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games ( Baltimore , 1-0 ; San Francisco , 5-0 ) . The 49ers , who posted a regular-season record of 11-4-1 , entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history ( and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season ) , which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise . The Ravens , who posted a 10-6 regular-season record , made their second Super Bowl appearance in 12 years , having previously won Super Bowl XXXV .

The National Football League ( NFL ) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35-10 . Coming into this game , considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL , thus the teams representing the two rival leagues ( Kansas City and Green Bay , respectively ) felt pressure to win . The Chiefs posted an 11-2-1 record during the 1966 AFL season , and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31-7 , in the AFL Championship Game . The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12-2 , and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-27 in the NFL Championship Game . Still , many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL , and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City . The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive , as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards , 181-164 , to come within 14-10 at halftime . Early in the 3rd quarter , Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line . The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr , who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns , with one interception , was named MVP .

The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11-3 regular-season record and playoff victories over the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys . Despite being undefeated , the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs , largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule .

  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition",
