Born in Chekiang ( Zhejiang ) Province , Chiang was a member of the Kuomintang and a lieutenant of Sun Yat-sen in the revolution to overthrow the Beiyang government and reunify China . With Soviet and communist ( CPC ) help , Chiang organized the military for Sun 's Canton Nationalist Government and headed the Whampoa Military Academy . Commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army ( from which he came to be known as Generalissimo ) , he led the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 , before defeating a coalition of warlords and nominally reunifying China under a new Nationalist government . Midway through the campaign , the KMT-CPC alliance broke down and Chiang purged the communists inside the party , triggering a civil war with the CCP , which he eventually lost in 1949 . As leader of the Republic of China in the Nanjing decade , Chiang sought to strike a difficult balance between the modernizing China while also devoting resources to defending the nation against the impending Japanese threat . Trying to avoid a war with Japan while hostilities with CCP continued , he was kidnapped in the Xi'an Incident and obliged to form an Anti-Japanese United Front with the CCP . Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 , he mobilized China for the Second Sino-Japanese War . For eight years he led the war of resistance against a vastly superior enemy , mostly from the wartime capital Chongqing . As the leader of a major Allied power , Chiang met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Cairo Conference to discuss terms for Japanese surrender . No sooner had the Second World War ended than the Civil War with the communists , by then led by Mao Zedong , resumed . Chiang 's nationalists were mostly defeated in a few decisive battles in 1948",

It also became the regular army of the ROC during the KMT 's period of party rule beginning in 1928 . It was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces after the 1947 Constitution , which instituted civilian control of the military . Originally organized with Soviet aid as a means for the KMT to unify China during the Warlord Era , the National Revolutionary Army fought major engagements in the Northern Expedition against the Chinese Beiyang Army warlords , in the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) against the Imperial Japanese Army and in the Chinese Civil War against the People 's Liberation Army . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the armed forces of the Communist Party of China were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army ( while retaining separate commands ) , but broke away to form the People 's Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war . With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947 and the formal end of the KMT party-state , the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces , with the bulk of its forces forming the Republic of China Army , which retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949",
  "/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912\u201349)": "The Republic of China ( ROC ) was a sovereign state in mainland China between 1912 and 1949 , prior to the nationalist government 's relocation to the island of Taiwan . It was established in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution , which overthrew the Qing dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . The Republic 's first president , Sun Yat-sen , served only briefly before handing over the position to Yuan Shikai , the leader of the Beiyang Army . Sun 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , then led by Song Jiaoren , won the parliamentary election held in December 1912 . However , Song was assassinated on Yuan 's orders shortly after ; and the Beiyang Army , led by Yuan , maintained full control of the Beiyang government . Between late 1915 and early 1916 , Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China before abdicating not long after due to popular unrest . After Yuan 's death in 1916 , the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty . Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing Warlord Era . In 1921 , the KMT established a rival government in Canton , supported by the fledgling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . The economy of northern China , overtaxed to support warlord adventurism , collapsed between 1927 and 1928 . General Chiang Kai-shek , who became the KMT leader after Sun 's death , started the Northern Expedition in 1926 to overthrow the Beiyang government , which was accomplished in 1928 . In April 1927 , Chiang established a nationalist government in Nanking , and massacred Communists in Shanghai",
  "/wiki/Northern_Expedition": "The Northern Expedition was a military campaign launched by the National Revolutionary Army ( NRA ) of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party , against the Beiyang government and other regional warlords in 1926 . The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China , which had become fragmented in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1911 . The expedition was led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , and was divided into two phases . The first phase ended in a 1927 political split between two factions of the KMT : the right-leaning Nanjing faction , led by Chiang , and the left-leaning faction in Wuhan , led by Wang Jingwei . The split was partially motivated by Chiang 's purging of communists within the KMT , which marked the end of the First United Front . In an effort to mend this schism , Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as the commander of the NRA in August 1927 , and went into exile in Japan . The second phase of the Expedition began in January 1928 , when Chiang resumed command . By April 1928 , the nationalist forces had advanced to the Yellow River . With the assistance of allied warlords including Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang , nationalist forces secured a series of decisive victories against the Beiyang Army . As they approached Beijing , Zhang Zuolin , leader of the Manchuria-based Fengtian clique , was forced to flee , and was assassinated shortly thereafter by the Japanese . His son , Zhang Xueliang , took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique , and in December 1928 , announced that Manchuria would accept the authority of the nationalist government in Nanjing . With the final piece of China under KMT control , the Northern Expedition concluded successfully and China was reunified , heralding the start of the Nanjing decade",

He is best known for regrouping the retreating allied armies to defeat the Germans at the strategically decisive First Battle of the Marne in September 1914 . His political position waned after unsuccessful offensives in 1915 , the German attack on Verdun in 1916 , and the disappointing results of the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme in 1916 . At the end of 1916 he was promoted to Marshal of France , the first such promotion under the Third Republic , and moved to an advisory role , from which he quickly resigned .

The third-largest empire in history , at its greatest extent stretching over three continents , Europe , Asia , and North America , the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires . The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 .

An aggressive , even reckless commander at the First Marne , Flanders , and Artois campaigns of 1914-1916 , Foch became the Allied Commander-in-Chief in late March 1918 in the face of the all-out German spring offensive , which pushed the Allies back using fresh soldiers and new tactics that trenches could not contain . He successfully coordinated the French , British and American efforts into a coherent whole , deftly handling his strategic reserves . He stopped the German offensive and launched a war-winning counterattack . In November 1918 , Marshal Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities and was present at the armistice of 11 November 1918 . At the outbreak of war in August 1914 , Foch 's XX Corps participated in the brief invasion of Germany before retreating in the face of a German counter-attack and successfully blocking the Germans short of Nancy . Ordered west to defend Paris , Foch 's prestige soared as a result of the victory at the Marne , for which he was widely credited as a chief protagonist while commanding the French Ninth Army . He was then promoted again to Assistant Commander-in-Chief for the Northern Zone , a role which evolved into command of Army Group North , and in which role he was required to cooperate with the British forces at Ypres and the Somme . At the end of 1916 , partly owing to the disappointing results of the latter offensive and partly owing to wartime political rivalries , Foch was transferred to Italy . Foch was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on 26 March 1918 following being the Commander-in-Chief of Western Front with the title G\u00e9n\u00e9ralissime in 1918 .

The Commander-in-chief of the French Armed Forces at the start of World War II , Gamelin was viewed as a man with significant intellectual ability . He was respected , even in Germany , for his intelligence and subtle mind , though he was viewed by some German generals as stiff and predictable . Despite this , and his competent service in World War I , his command of the French armies during the critical days of May 1940 proved to be disastrous . Historian and journalist William L. Shirer presented the view that Gamelin used World War I methods to fight World War II , but with less vigor and slower response . Gamelin served with distinction under Joseph Joffre in World War I . He is often credited with being responsible for devising the outline of the French counter-attack in 1914 which led to victory during the First Battle of the Marne . In 1933 Gamelin rose to command the French Army and oversaw a modernisation and mechanisation programme , including the completion of the Maginot Line defences . \u00c9douard Daladier supported Gamelin throughout his career owing to his refusal to allow politics to play a part in military planning and promotion , and his commitment to the republican model of government ; this was not a trivial matter at a time when Communists on the left and Royalists and Fascists on the right were openly advocating regime change in France",

After his arrival , he was shocked by the rich soil he had found . He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes , but in New Spain ( modern Mexico ) growing these crops was discouraged or prohibited by the authorities due to Spanish imports of the items . In 1810 he gave the famous speech , Cry of Dolores , calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Fernando VII ( held captive by Napoleon ) by revolting against the European-born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy . He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians who attacked and killed both Spanish Peninsulares and Criollo elites , even though Hidalgo 's troops lacked training and were poorly armed . These troops ran into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops ; most of Hidalgo 's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calder\u00f3n Bridge . After the battle , Hidalgo and his remaining troops fled north , but Hidalgo was betrayed , captured and executed",

After the Battle of San Lorenzo and time commanding the Army of the North during 1814 , he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north , using an alternative path to the Viceroyalty of Peru . This objective first involved the establishment of a new army , the Army of the Andes , in Cuyo Province , Argentina . From there , he led the Crossing of the Andes to Chile , and triumphed at the Battle of Chacabuco and the Battle of Maip\u00fa ( 1818 ) , thus liberating Chile from royalist rule .

During his rule Franco assumed the title Caudillo . This period in Spanish history , from the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War to Franco 's death , is commonly known as Francoist Spain or the Francoist dictatorship . Franco was born in Ferrol , Spain as the son of an upper-class family with strong traditional ties and several generations of high-ranking officers in the Spanish Navy . But due to the navy being crippled by the Spanish-American War Franco instead joined the Spanish Army as a cadet in the Toledo Infantry Academy in 1907 , graduating in 1910 . He would then go on to serve in Morocco , rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics . In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33 , the youngest General in all Europe , and two years later he became director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza . As a conservative and a monarchist , Franco regretted the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic in 1931 . He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy , but nevertheless continued his service in the Republican Army . For a time he was even left without posting , but his career improved after the right wing CEDA and PRR won the 1933 election .

He held the posts of Premier from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994 . He was also the leader of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) from 1949 to 1994 ( titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as General Secretary after 1966 ) . Coming to power after the end of Japanese rule in 1945 , he authorized the invasion of South Korea in 1950 , triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the United Nations led by the United States . Following the military stalemate in the Korean War , a ceasefire was signed on 27 July 1953 . He was the third longest-serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century , in office for more than 45 years . Under his leadership , North Korea was established as a communist state with a publicly owned and planned economy . It had close political and economic relations with the Soviet Union . By the 1960s , North Korea briefly enjoyed a standard of living higher than the South , which was fraught with political instability and economic crises . The situation reversed in the 1970s , as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse fueled by Japanese and American investment , military aid , and internal economic development , while North Korea stagnated and then declined in the 1980s . Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union , chief among them being Kim Il-sung 's philosophy of Juche , which focused on Korean nationalism , self-reliance , and socialism . Despite this , the country received funds , subsidies and aid from the USSR ( and the Eastern Bloc ) until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members . Juche , an ideology of national self-reliance , was introduced into the constitution in 1972",

He ruled from the death of his father , Kim Il-sung , the first leader of North Korea in 1994 until his own death in 2011 . In the early 1980s , Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs . Kim succeeded his father and DPRK founder Kim Il-sung , following the elder Kim 's death in 1994 . Kim was the General Secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , WPK Presidium , Chairman of the National Defence Commission ( NDC ) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , the fourth-largest standing army in the world . Kim assumed supreme leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union , on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies , which brought a famine . While the famine had ended by the late 1990s , food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure due in part to the country 's mountainous geography unsuited for high-yielding agriculture as well as externally-imposed sanctions due to concerns about the country 's human rights situation . Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun ( military-first ) policies , making the army the central organizer of civil society . Kim 's rule also saw tentative economic reforms , including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003 . In April 2009 , North Korea 's constitution was amended to refer to him and his successors as the supreme leader of the DPRK . Outside observers have characterized him as a dictator and accused him of human rights violations . The most common colloquial title given to Kim was Dear Leader to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung , the Great Leader",

He served as president from 1930 to 1938 and again from 1942 to 1952 , ruling for the rest of the time as an unelected military strongman under figurehead presidents . [ Note 1 ] His 31 years in power , to Dominicans known as the Trujillo Era ( Spanish : El Trujillato ) , are considered one of the bloodiest eras ever in the Americas , as well as a time of a personality cult , when monuments to Trujillo were in abundance . Trujillo and his regime were responsible for many deaths , including between 20,000 and 30,000 Haitians in the infamous Parsley massacre . [ Note 2 ] [ Note 3 ] During this long period of oppression and death , the Trujillo government extended its policy of state terrorism beyond national borders . Notorious examples of Trujillo 's reach abroad are the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Caracas against Venezuelan President R\u00f3mulo Betancourt ( 1960 ) , the abduction and subsequent disappearance in New York City of the Spaniard Jes\u00fas Gal\u00edndez ( 1956 ) , the murder of writer Jos\u00e9 Almoina in Mexico , also a Spaniard , and crimes committed against Cubans , Costa Ricans , Nicaraguans , Puerto Ricans , as well as United States citizens . The Trujillo era unfolded in a Hispanic Caribbean environment that was particularly fertile for dictatorial regimes . [ Note 4 ] In the countries of the Caribbean Basin alone , his dictatorship was concurrent , in whole or in part , with those in Cuba , Nicaragua , Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Venezuela , and Haiti . In retrospect , the Trujillo dictatorship has been characterized as more prominent and more brutal than those that rose and fell around it",

It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Republic of Haiti , making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands , along with Saint Martin , that are shared by two sovereign states . The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area ( after Cuba ) at 48,671 square kilometers ( 18,792 sq mi ) , and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people ( 2020 est . ) , of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo , the capital city . The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822",

He is referred as the Father of the Nation in the Republic of China due to his instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution . Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both mainland China and Taiwan . Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China , but his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile . After the success of the revolution in which Han Chinese regained power after 268 years of living under the Manchu Qing dynasty , he quickly resigned as President of the newly founded Republic of China and relinquished it to Yuan Shikai . He soon went to exile in Japan for safety but returned to found a revolutionary government in the South as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation . In 1923 , he invited representatives of the Communist International to Canton to re-organize his party and formed a brittle alliance with the Chinese Communist Party . He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor , Chiang Kai-shek in the Northern Expedition . He died in Beijing of gallbladder cancer on 12 March 1925 . Sun 's chief legacy is his political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People : nationalism ( independence from foreign imperialist domination ) , rights of the people ( sometimes translated as democracy ) , and the people 's livelihood ( sometimes translated as socialism , or literally a scientific study of helping people to survive in the society , as he explained the difference between his socialism and that of Karl Marx in his book )",
