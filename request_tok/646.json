  "/wiki/T-Mek": "T-MEK is a two-player , sit-down , virtual reality fighting arcade game developed by Atari Games and published by Time Warner Interactive in 1994 . Each player can choose their MEK ( a hovering tank with special weapons and abilities ) . One player can play against 6 AI players and the occasional boss , or two players can play against each other and 4 AI players . There is a special tournament mode where two players can go one on one . Up to three T-MEK cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions . T-MEK was later ported to MS-DOS and the Sega 32X ; rather than linking multiple systems together , the home versions featured split-screen multiplayer for two players . T-MEK featured surround sound , which Time Warner Interactive advertised as CAGE Audio . Each player 's station had four speakers ; two in front and two behind the player , and a subwoofer mounted directly below the seat . T-MEK has no background music soundtrack , which was a departure for deluxe arcade games in the coming-of-age era of digitally sampled audio , and instead relied upon the sound to help aid the player in finding enemies .",

The genre normally features a variety of different vehicles available for play , each with its own strengths , weaknesses , and special attack abilities . Players may also unlock hidden vehicles by completing certain in-game tasks . Traditionally , vehicular combat games focus on fast-paced action inside the vehicle , rarely , if ever , concerning themselves with role-playing or other elements , Metal Max series being an exception . Games may include racing themes , but they are generally secondary to the action .",
  "/wiki/Tank_(video_game)": "Tank is an arcade game developed by Kee Games , a subsidiary of Atari , and released in November 1974 . It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property developed by Kee Games , which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies . In the game , two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines , represented by X marks , in a central minefield . Each player controls their tank with a pair of joysticks , moving them forwards and back to drive , reverse , and steer , and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank . The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point , and tanks reappear after being destroyed . The winner is the player with more points when time runs out , with each game typically one or two minutes long . Tank was designed by Steve Bristow , who had previously worked with the founders of Atari on Computer Space , the first arcade video game , and was developed by Lyle Rains . It was created as part of Bristow 's vision to move the company away from only producing copies of Atari 's games into also developing original titles . The game 's cabinet was designed by Peter Takaichi . In September 1974 , Atari announced a merger with Kee , which went into effect a month after the release of the game . The game was commercially successful , selling over 10,000 units and buoying Atari 's then-troubled finances . It led to a cocktail cabinet release of the game and to four sequels : Tank II ( 1974 ) , Tank III ( 1975 ) , Tank 8 ( 1976 ) , and Ultra Tank ( 1978 ) .",

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",

Golomb in 1953 . ) The game , or one of its many variants , is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system , as well as on devices such as graphing calculators , mobile phones , portable media players , PDAs , Network music players , and as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes . It has inspired Tetris serving dishes , and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings .

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from cool to warm , hot , and critical status as it is used . Players can only defuse the ball , resetting it from its current state back to cool by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession , whether through touchdown , interception or fumble . A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball . The robots also possess finite durability . As offensive units are tackled , they wear down , finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits . A flaming robot will explode when hit , thereby fumbling the ball . Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play . Players select from run , pass or option plays on offense , after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose . On defense , a player can select short , medium or long defenses , and then select a specific defensive scheme . The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors , each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players , but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well .

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing ."
