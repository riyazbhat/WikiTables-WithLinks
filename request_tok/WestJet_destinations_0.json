Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants .

The airport is sometimes considered as a reliever for Toronto Pearson International Airport . The airport opened in 1940 as Mount Hope Airport , which was primarily a Royal Canadian Air Force base . The end of World War II saw the closure of the base , and its conversion to civil use attracted regional and international passenger services with connections to major Canadian cities and seasonal destinations in the United States , the Caribbean and Mexico . Regular services to the United States declined as nearby Buffalo Niagara International Airport gained popularity for cross-border travellers in the region , but Hamilton remained an important base for a number of domestic low-cost carriers .
