During the 1940s and 1950s , several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs . Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport . After the expansion , civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s .
