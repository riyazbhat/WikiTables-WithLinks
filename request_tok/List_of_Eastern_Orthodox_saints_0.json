Fl\u00e1vios P\u00e9tros Sabb\u00e1tios Ioustinian\u00f3s ; c. 482 - 14 November 565 ) , traditionally known as Justinian the Great and also Saint Justinian the Great in the Eastern Orthodox Church , was the Eastern Roman emperor from 527 to 565 . During his reign , Justinian sought to revive the empire 's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the historical Roman Empire . Justinian 's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Later Roman empire , and his reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized renovatio imperii , or restoration of the Empire . Because of his restoration activities , Justinian has sometimes been known as the Last Roman in mid 20th century historiography . This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct Western Roman Empire . His general , Belisarius , swiftly conquered the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa . Subsequently , Belisarius , Narses , and other generals conquered the Ostrogothic kingdom , restoring Dalmatia , Sicily , Italy , and Rome to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the Ostrogoths . The prefect Liberius reclaimed the south of the Iberian peninsula , establishing the province of Spania . These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean , increasing the Empire 's annual revenue by over a million solidi . During his reign , Justinian also subdued the Tzani , a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been under Roman rule before . He engaged the Sasanian Empire in the east during Kavad I 's reign , and later again during Khosrow I 's ; this second conflict was partially initiated due to his ambitions in the west",
