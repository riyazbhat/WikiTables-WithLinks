He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown 's television show , but after enduring constant abuse , Bob attempted to frame his employer for armed robbery in Krusty Gets Busted . The plan was foiled by his arch-enemy , Bart Simpson , and Sideshow Bob was sent to prison . Bob made his second major appearance in season three 's Black Widower ; the writers echoed the premise of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart 's life , threatening to disrupt - and sometimes end - it . In each appearance thereafter , Bob has assumed the role on The Simpsons of an evil genius . Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan , usually foiled by Bart and Lisa . His plans often involve murder and destruction , usually targeted at Bart or , less often , Krusty , though these plans often involve targeting the entire Simpson family . In 2015 , however , during the Treehouse of Horror segment , Wanted : Dead , Then Alive , Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart , commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child ; however , he becomes bored with Bart dead , so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again . Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer 's character Frasier Crane from the sitcoms Cheers and Frasier , and has been described as Frasier pickled in arsenic . Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in The Simpsons between Bob and Frasier Crane - Bob 's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney respectively , echoing the roles they played in Frasier .",

At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later .

  "/wiki/Zombies": "A zombie ( Haitian French : zombi , Haitian Creole : zonbi ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a corpse . Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works . The term comes from Haitian folklore , in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods , most commonly magic . Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers , radiation , mental diseases , vectors , pathogens , parasites , scientific accidents , etc . The English word zombie was first recorded in 1819 , in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey , in the form of zombi . The Oxford English Dictionary gives the word 's origin as West African and compares it to the Kongo words nzambi ( god ) and zumbi ( fetish ) . A Kimbundu-to-Portuguese dictionary from 1903 defines the related word nzumbi as soul , while a later Kimbundu-Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living . One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was The Magic Island ( 1929 ) by W. B. Seabrook . This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls . Time commented that the book introduced 'zombi ' into U.S. speech . Zombies have a complex literary heritage , with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein drawing on European folklore of the undead . Victor Halperin directed White Zombie ( 1932 ) , a horror film starring Bela Lugosi .",

There are two main methods to achieve this - the first incorporates a metal clasp of two prongs , which are put through a reinforced eyelet in the flap and then bent apart to hold . The other has a cardboard button secured tightly on the flap and a piece of string fastened on the envelope body ( or the reverse arrangement ) is wound around it to form a closure . In a more general sense , envelopes made of brown , unbleached paper , used for cheapness , are described as Manila envelopes .

  "/wiki/Vandalism_of_Wikipedia": "On Wikipedia , vandalism is the act of editing the project in a malicious manner that is intentionally disruptive . Vandalism includes the addition , removal , or modification of the text or other material that is either humorous , nonsensical , a hoax , or that is of an offensive , humiliating , or otherwise degrading nature . Throughout its history , Wikipedia has struggled to maintain a balance between allowing the freedom of open editing and protecting the accuracy of its information when false information can be potentially damaging to its subjects . Vandalism is easy to commit on Wikipedia because anyone can edit the site , with the exception of articles that are currently semi-protected , which means that new and unregistered users can not edit them . Vandalism can be committed by either guest editors or those with registered accounts ; however , a semi-protected or protected page can only be edited by autoconfirmed or confirmed Wikipedia editors , or administrators , respectively . Frequent targets of vandalism include articles on hot and controversial topics , famous celebrities , and current events . In some cases , people have been falsely reported as having died . This has notably happened to United States Senators Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd ( both of whom are now deceased ) , and American rapper Kanye West ( who is alive ) . The challenge from vandalism on Wikipedia was once characterized by the former Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica editor-in-chief Robert McHenry : The user who visits Wikipedia ... is rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom . It may be obviously dirty so that he knows to exercise great care , or it may seem fairly clean , so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security .

  "/wiki/Oxygen": "Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8 . It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table , a highly reactive nonmetal , and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds . By mass , oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2 . Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 % of the Earth 's atmosphere . As compounds including oxides , the element makes up almost half of the Earth 's crust . Dioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth 's atmosphere by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide . Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . Another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( O3 ) , strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation . However , ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant .",
