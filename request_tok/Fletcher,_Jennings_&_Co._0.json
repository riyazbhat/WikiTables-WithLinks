While the first locomotives of this wheel arrangement were tender engines , the configuration was later often used for tank engines , which is noted by adding letter suffixes to the configuration , such as for a conventional side-tank locomotive , for a saddle-tank locomotive , for a well-tank locomotive and for a rack-equipped tank locomotive . The arrangement is sometimes known as Olomana after a Hawaiian 0-4-2 locomotive of 1883 .",
  "/wiki/Saddle_tank_locomotive": "A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks , instead of a more traditional tender . A tank engine may also have a bunker ( or oil tank ) to hold fuel . There are several different types of tank locomotive , distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers . The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler . This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks , and later for shunting and shorter distance main line duties . Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional tender locomotives .",
  "/wiki/Talyllyn_Railway": "The Talyllyn Railway ( Welsh : Rheilffordd Talyllyn ) is a narrow gauge preserved railway in Wales running for 7 1\u20444 miles ( 12 km ) from Tywyn [ a ] on the Mid-Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn . The line was opened in 1865 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn , and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage . Despite severe under-investment , the line remained open , and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers . Since preservation , the railway has operated as a tourist attraction , expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages . In 1976 , an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol . In 2001 , the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary , and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place , including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum . The fictional Skarloey Railway , which formed part of The Railway Series of children 's books by The Rev . W. Awdry , was based on the Talyllyn Railway . The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt .",
  "/wiki/Wales": "Wales ( Welsh : Cymru [ \u02c8k\u0259mri ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 ( 8,023 sq mi ) . Wales has over 1,680 miles ( 2,700 km ) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .",
  "/wiki/Dolgoch_(locomotive)": "Dolgoch is a narrow gauge 0-4-0 well tank steam locomotive . It was built by Fletcher , Jennings & Co. in 1866 and is one of the oldest locomotives still in active service . It was delivered to the Talyllyn Railway in 1866 and continues to run on this railway . Dolgoch holds an important place in railway preservation history as it was the only serviceable locomotive on the Talyllyn Railway when it became the first ever preserved railway to be operated by volunteers in 1951 , and largely single-handedly kept the railway going during this first season .",
  "/wiki/0-4-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-4-0 represents one of the simplest possible types , that with two axles and four coupled wheels , all of which are driven . The wheels on the earliest four-coupled locomotives were connected by a single gear wheel , but from 1825 the wheels were usually connected with coupling rods to form a single driven set . The notation 0-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself , rather than in an attached tender . In Britain , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod-coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification used in Europe and , in more recent years , in simplified form in the United States , an 0-4-0 is classified as B ( German and Italian ) if the axles are connected by side rods or gearing and 020 ( French ) , independent of axle motoring . The UIC 's Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored , which would be 0-2-2-0 under the Whyte notation .",

In the United Kingdom , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification , popular in Europe , this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears , or Co if they are independently driven , the latter usually being electric and diesel-electric locomotives .",

The first preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world to operate a public service the society ran its first train on 7 August 1960 , less than three years after the line from East Grinstead to Lewes had been closed by British Railways . On 23 March 2013 , the Bluebell Railway started to run through to its new terminus station . At East Grinstead there is a connection to the national rail network , the first connection of the Bluebell Railway to the national network in 50 years , since the Horsted Keynes - line closed in 1963 . Today the railway is managed and run largely by volunteers . Having preserved a number of steam locomotives even before steam stopped running on British mainline railways in 1968 , today it has over 30 steam locomotives - the largest collection in the UK after the National Railway Museum . The Bluebell also has almost 150 carriages and wagons , most of them pre-1939 .",
  "/wiki/Sussex": "Sussex ( /\u02c8s\u028cs\u026aks/ ) , from the Old English S\u016b\u00fes\u0113axe ( South Saxons ) , is a historic county in South East England corresponding roughly in area to the ancient Kingdom of Sussex . It is bounded to the west by Hampshire , north by Surrey , northeast by Kent , south by the English Channel , and divided for many purposes into the ceremonial counties of West Sussex and East Sussex . Brighton and Hove , though part of East Sussex , was made a unitary authority in 1997 , and as such , is administered independently of the rest of East Sussex . Brighton and Hove was granted City status in 2000 . Until then , Chichester was Sussex 's only city . Sussex has three main geographic sub-regions , each oriented approximately east to west . In the southwest is the fertile and densely populated coastal plain . North of this are the rolling chalk hills of the South Downs , beyond which is the well-wooded Sussex Weald . The name derives from the Kingdom of Sussex , which was founded , according to legend , by \u00c6lle of Sussex in AD 477 . Around 827 , it was absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex and subsequently into the kingdom of England . It was the home of some of Europe 's earliest recorded hominids , whose remains have been found at Boxgrove . It was invaded by the Romans and is the site of the Battle of Hastings .",
