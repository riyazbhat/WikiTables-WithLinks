Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom",
  "/wiki/Kayfabe": "In professional wrestling , kayfabe /\u02c8ke\u026afe\u026ab/ ( also called work or worked ) is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as real or true , specifically the portrayal of competition , rivalries , and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or predetermined nature of any kind . The term kayfabe has evolved to also become a code word of sorts for maintaining this reality within the direct or indirect presence of the general public . Kayfabe is often seen as the suspension of disbelief that is used to create the non-wrestling aspects of promotions , such as feuds , angles , and gimmicks in a manner similar to other forms of fictional entertainment . In relative terms , a wrestler breaking kayfabe during a show would be likened to an actor breaking character on-camera . Also , since wrestling is performed in front of a live audience , whose interaction with the show is crucial to its success , kayfabe can be compared to the fourth wall in acting , since hardly any conventional fourth wall exists to begin with . In general , everything in a professional wrestling show is to some extent scripted , or kayfabe , even though at times it is portrayed as real-life . Kayfabe was fiercely maintained for decades , but with the advent of the Internet wrestling community , and the sports entertainment movement , the pro wrestling industry has become less concerned with protecting so-called backstage secrets and typically maintains kayfabe only during the shows . Kayfabe is , however , occasionally broken during shows , usually when dealing with genuine injuries during a match or paying tribute to wrestlers",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas .
