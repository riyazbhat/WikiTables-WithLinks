  "/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription": "The Royal Thai General System of Transcription ( RTGS ) is the official system for rendering Thai words in the Latin alphabet . It was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand . It is used in road signs and government publications and is the closest method to a standard of transcription for Thai , but its use , by even the government , is inconsistent . The system is almost identical to the one that is defined by ISO 11940-2",

The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles",
  "/wiki/Mee_pok": "Mee pok is a noodle dish with Chinese noodle characterized by its flat and yellow appearance , varying in thickness and width . The dish is of Teochew origin and is commonly served in a number of countries such as Chaoshan ( China ) , Singapore , Malaysia and Thailand . Mee pok is commonly served tossed in a sauce ( often referred to as dry , or tah in Hokkien ( Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b : ta ) ) , though sometimes served in a soup ( where it is referred to as soup , or terng ) . Meat and vegetables are added on top . Mee pok can be categorised into two variants , fish ball mee pok ( yu wan mee pok ) , and mushroom minced meat mee pok ( bak chor mee ) . Bak chor mee is usually exclusively prepared using thin noodles ( mee kia ) , while yu wan mee can be cooked with other noodle varieties . Mee pok is a staple commonly offered in hawker centres and coffee shops ( Kopitiams in parts of Southeast Asia ) in Singapore , together with other Chinese noodle dishes",

  "/wiki/Wheat": "Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed , a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food . The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum ; the most widely grown is common wheat ( T. aestivum ) . The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE . Botanically , the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis . Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop ( 220.4 million hectares , 2014 ) . World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined . In 2017 , world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes , with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes , making it the second most-produced cereal after maize . Since 1960 , world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century . Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins , which facilitate the production of processed foods , whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet . Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates . Globally , it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food , having a protein content of about 13 % , which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids . When eaten as the whole grain , wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber",

Its fragrance , reminiscent of pandan ( Pandanus amaryllifolius ) and popcorn , results from the rice plant 's natural production of aroma compounds , of which 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline is the most salient . In typical packaging and storage , these aroma compounds dissipate within a few months . [ citation needed ] This rapid loss of aromatic intensity leads many Southeast Asians and connoisseurs to prefer each year 's freshly harvested new crop of jasmine rice . Jasmine rice is a variety of Oryza sativa . [ citation needed ] Jasmine rice is grown primarily in Thailand ( Thai hom mali or Thai fragrant rice ) , Cambodia ( angkor kra'oup or Cambodian jasmine rice ) , Laos , and southern Vietnam . It is moist and soft in texture when cooked , with a slightly sweet flavor . The grains cling and are somewhat sticky when cooked , though less sticky than glutinous rice ( Oryza sativa var . glutinosa ) , as it has less amylopectin . It is about three times stickier than American long-grain rice . To harvest jasmine rice , the long stalks are cut and threshed . The rice can then be left in a hulled form called paddy rice , de-hulled to produce brown rice , or milled to remove the germ and some or all of the bran , producing white rice",

Of the 40 % of Thais who work in agriculture , 16 million of them are rice farmers by one estimate . Thailand has a strong tradition of rice production . It has the fifth-largest amount of land under rice cultivation in the world and is the world 's second largest exporter of rice . Thailand has plans to further increase the land available for rice production , with a goal of adding 500,000 hectares to its already 9.2 million hectares of rice-growing areas . Fully half of Thailand 's cultivated land is devoted to rice . The Thai Ministry of Agriculture projects paddy production for both the main and second crops to hit 27-28 million tonnes in the 2019-2020 season , dragged down by a drop in second crop production due to floods and drought .

Jasmine has a significantly lower crop yield than other types of rice , but normally fetches more than double the price of other strains on the global market . Due to ongoing droughts , the USDA has forecast output will drop by more than a fifth to 15.8 million tonnes in 2016 .

It is widely consumed across Asia . It is called glutinous ( Latin : gl\u016btin\u014dsus ) in the sense of being glue-like or sticky , and not in the sense of containing gluten ( which it does not ) . While often called sticky rice , it differs from non-glutinous strains of japonica rice which also become sticky to some degree when cooked .
