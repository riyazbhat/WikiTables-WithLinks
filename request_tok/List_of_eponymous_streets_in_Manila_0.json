Bohemia was a duchy of Great Moravia , later an independent principality , a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire , and subsequently a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austrian Empire . After World War I and the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state , the total of Bohemia became a part of Czechoslovakia , defying claims of the German speaking inhabitants that regions with German speaking majority should be included in the Republic of German-Austria . Between 1938 and 1945 , these border regions were joined to Nazi Germany as the Sudetenland . The remainder of Czech territory became the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was subsequently occupied as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia . In 1969 , the Czech lands ( including Bohemia ) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the Czech Socialist Republic . In 1990 , the name was changed to the Czech Republic , which became a separate state in 1993 with the breakup of Czechoslovakia . Until 1948 , Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its lands ( zem\u011b ) .
