With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

  "/wiki/Opera": "Opera is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers , but is distinct from musical theater . Such a work ( the literal translation of Italian word opera ) is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs , opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater , Singspiel and Op\u00e9ra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style , and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his reform operas in the 1760s . The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) , and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , landmarks in the German tradition . The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed .",

Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles .

  "/wiki/R&B": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",

Redding 's version is a plea from a desperate man , who will give his woman anything she wants . He wo n't care if she does him wrong , as long as he gets his due respect when he brings money home .

Before that , Du Bois had risen to national prominence as the leader of the Niagara Movement , a group of African-American activists that wanted equal rights for blacks . Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise , an agreement crafted by Booker T. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule , while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities . Instead , Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation , which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite . He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth , a concept under the umbrella of Racial uplift , and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership . Racism was the main target of Du Bois 's polemics , and he strongly protested against lynching , Jim Crow laws , and discrimination in education and employment .

  "/wiki/Blues": "Blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s by African-Americans from roots in African musical traditions , African-American work songs , and spirituals . Blues incorporated spirituals , work songs , field hollers , shouts , chants , and rhymed simple narrative ballads . The blues form , ubiquitous in jazz , rhythm and blues and rock and roll , is characterized by the call-and-response pattern , the blues scale and specific chord progressions , of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common . Blue notes ( or worried notes ) , usually thirds , fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound . Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove . Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics , bass lines , and instrumentation . Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times . It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard : the AAB pattern , consisting of a line sung over the four first bars , its repetition over the next four , and then a longer concluding line over the last bars . Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative , often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans . Many elements , such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes , can be traced back to the music of Africa . The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community , the spirituals . The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and , later , the development of juke joints .",
