Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71 % of its territory , 58 % of its population , and 32 % of ethnic Hungarians .",

In 1957 he moved on to the newly founded Fuji Television and rose through the ranks as a producer and director . One of his television shows , the chambara Three Outlaw Samurai , so impressed the heads of the Shochiku film studio that he was offered the chance to adapt it as a feature film in 1964 . Following this film 's financial success , he directed a string of equally successful chambara productions through the end of the 1960s . His two most critical and popular successes of the period are Goyokin and Hitokiri ( also known as Tenchu ) , both released in 1969 and both considered to be two of the finest examples of the chambara genre . During the 1970s Gosha abandoned pure chambara and turned his productive energies toward films in the yakuza genre but he still produced period sword films such as The Wolves ( 1971 film ) ( 1972 ) , Bandits vs. Samurai Squadron ( 1978 ) , and Hunter in the Dark ( 1979 ) .

Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
