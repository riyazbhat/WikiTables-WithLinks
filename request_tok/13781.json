  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",
