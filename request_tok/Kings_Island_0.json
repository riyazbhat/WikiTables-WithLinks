  "/wiki/Inverted_roller_coaster": "An inverted roller coaster is a roller coaster in which the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage .

Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s .

S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved .

  "/wiki/Drop_tower_(ride)": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism",
