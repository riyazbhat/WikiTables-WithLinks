It is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge .

It is encyclopedic in scope , but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopedia . It is the only work by Pliny to have survived , and the last that he published . He published the first 10 books in AD 77 , but had not made a final revision of the remainder at the time of his death during the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius . The rest was published posthumously by Pliny 's nephew , Pliny the Younger . The work is divided into 37 books , organised into ten volumes . These cover topics including astronomy , mathematics , geography , ethnography , anthropology , human physiology , zoology , botany , agriculture , horticulture , pharmacology , mining , mineralogy , sculpture , painting , and precious stones . Pliny 's Natural History became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter , its referencing of original authors , and its index .",

A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos .

Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured .

He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College , Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College , Oxford , from 1945 to 1959 . He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis - they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972 . After Tolkien 's death , his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father 's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts , including The Silmarillion . These , together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales , poems , fictional histories , invented languages , and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth [ b ] within it . Between 1951 and 1955 , Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings . While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien , the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature - or , more precisely , of high fantasy .

A futurist , he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft , tanks , space travel , nuclear weapons , satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web . His science fiction imagined time travel , alien invasion , invisibility , and biological engineering . Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the Shakespeare of science fiction . Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption - dubbed Wellss law - leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as O Realist of the Fantastic ! . His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , The Island of Doctor Moreau ( 1896 ) , The Invisible Man ( 1897 ) , The War of the Worlds ( 1898 ) and the military science fiction The War in the Air ( 1907 ) . Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times .

She was raised by her father who was able to provide her with a rich if informal education , encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories . When she was four , her father married a neighbour with whom Shelley came to have a troubled relationship . In 1814 , Shelley began a romance with one of her father 's political followers , Percy Bysshe Shelley , who was already married .

After thinking for days , Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made , inspiring the novel . Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement . Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because , in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction , the central character makes a deliberate decision and turns to modern experiments in the laboratory to achieve fantastic results .

  "/wiki/House_elves": "Magical creatures are an aspect of the fictional wizarding world contained in the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them series , both by British author J.K. Rowling . Throughout the seven books of the series , Harry and his friends come across many of these creatures on their adventures , as well as in their Care of Magical Creatures lessons at Hogwarts . Rowling has also written Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , a guide to the magical beasts found in the series . Many of these are derived from folklore , primarily Greek mythology , but also British and Scandinavian folklore . [ citation needed ] Many of the legends surrounding mythical creatures are also incorporated in the books . Children ... know that I did n't invent unicorns , but I 've had to explain frequently that I did n't actually invent hippogriffs , Rowling told Stephen Fry in an interview for BBC Radio 4 . When I do use a creature that I know is a mythological entity , I like to find out as much as I can about it . I might not use it , but to make it as consistent as I feel is good for my plot . Some creatures in the series are ordinary animals but may be imbued with magical properties or possess certain magical abilities . Owls , for example , deliver mail and have the ability to find the recipient regardless of their location . Other animals such as cats , frogs and rats do not necessarily have magical abilities .",
