  "/wiki/Aheu_language": "Thav\u01b0ng or Aheu is a language spoken by the Phon Sung people in Laos and Thailand . There are thought to be some 1,770 speakers in Laos , largely concentrated in Khamkeut District . A further 750 speakers live in 3 villages of Song Dao District , Sakon Nakhon Province , Thailand , namely Ban Nong Waeng ( in Pathum Wapi Subdistrict ) , Ban Nong Charoen , and Ban Nong Muang . Thavung makes a four-way distinction between clear and breathy phonation combined with glottalized final consonants . This is very similar to the situation in the Pearic languages in which , however , the glottalization is in the vowel .",

There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages . Of these languages , only Vietnamese , Khmer and Mon have a long-established recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages ( in Vietnam and Cambodia , respectively ) . The Mon language is a recognised indigenous language in Myanmar and Thailand . In Myanmar , the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State . Santali is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India . The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status . Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages . These form thirteen established families ( plus perhaps Shompen , which is poorly attested , as a fourteenth ) , which have traditionally been grouped into two , as Mon-Khmer and Munda . However , one recent classification posits three groups ( Munda , Nuclear Mon-Khmer and Khasi-Khmuic ) , while another has abandoned Mon-Khmer as a taxon altogether , making it synonymous with the larger family . Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India , Bangladesh , Nepal and East Asia , separated by regions where other languages are spoken . They appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia ( excluding the Andaman Islands ) , with the neighboring Indo-Aryan , Kra-Dai , Hmong-Mien , Dravidian , Austronesian , and Sino-Tibetan languages being the result of later migrations .",

Northern Khmer differs from the standard language , based on a dialect of Central Khmer , in the number and variety of vowel phonemes , consonantal distribution , lexicon , grammar , and , most notably , pronunciation of syllable-final /r/ , giving Northern Khmer a distinct accent easily recognizable by speakers of other dialects . Some speakers of Northern Khmer may understand other varieties of Khmer but speakers of standard Khmer who have not been exposed to Northern Khmer often have trouble understanding Northern Khmer at first . The two varieties are 80-85% cognate on a basic 270-word list . These facts have led some linguists to advocate considering Northern Khmer a separate , but closely related language .",

The language is known regionally in Laos and Thailand as Tai M\u00e8ne and Tai Nyaw and , in Vietnam as Tai Do and Tai Quy Chau . Superficially , Tai Yo appears to be a Southwestern Tai language but this is only because of centuries of language contact and it is properly classified with the Northern Tai languages . The Nyaw/Nyo spoken in central Thailand and western Cambodia is a dialect of Lao and not the same as Tai Yo .",

Ethnologue lists 95 languages in the family , with 62 of these being in the Tai branch . The high diversity of Kra-Dai languages in southern China points to the origin of the Kra-Dai language family in southern China . The Tai branch moved south into Southeast Asia only around 1000 AD . Genetic and linguistic analysis show great homogeneity between Kra-Dai speaking people in Thailand .",

Although it appears different from the Isan and the Lao languages , it is spoken in areas where these languages are predominant and has been influenced by them . Comparisons of Phu Thai with other Tai languages such as Tay Khang have not yet been done systematically enough to yield convincing results . Another aspect of Phu Thai is its contact with the Katuic languages , a branch of the Austroasiatic languages . Whether in the Phu Thai areas of Central Laos or in more recent locations of Northeastern Thailand , one can find , along with Phu Thai , a few Katuic dialects known locally as Bru , So or Katang . James R. Chamberlain ( 2012 ) focusing on anthropological issues describes the Phou Thay - Brou relationship as a symbiosis and states that the Phou Thay - Brou relationship has never evolved into a feudal system .",
