The player claims ( or is assigned ) one case or a box at the start of the game , without its contents being revealed . The contestant then chooses the other cases or boxes , one at a time , to be immediately opened and removed from play . Throughout the game , the player is offered an amount of money or prizes to quit , being asked the titular question , Deal or no deal ? If the contestant rejects every deal and eliminates all the other cases or boxes , the player keeps the money that was in the original case or box . Thus , the contestant wins depending on whether the player should have taken one of the deals or should have held onto the original case or box until the very end"
