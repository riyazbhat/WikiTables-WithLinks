  "/wiki/Carnegie,_California": "Carnegie was a town in Corral Hollow , in San Joaquin County , California from 1902 to about 1915 . It was discovered that the San Francisco & San Joaquin Coal Company 's Tesla coal mines in Corral Hollow contained a rich deposit of clay . Fueled by California 's rapid population growth and the subsequent demand for building materials mine owners James and John Treadwell of the Treadwell gold mine formed the Carnegie Brick and Pottery Company in 1902 . The Treadwells named the company after philanthropist Andrew Carnegie . In 1904 the plant to make brick and architectural terra cotta was built near the Alameda and San Joaquin Railroad line , four miles east of the coal mining town of Tesla . A town was in place with over 300 inhabitants ( mainly Italian artisans ) and the town 's brick factory was producing upwards of 100,000 bricks per day . In 1904 , the Pottery sewer pipe plant was built between Carnegie and Tesla . In 1911 a flood destroyed bridges , roads , and buildings which the company could not afford to rebuild . The towns of Carnegie and Tesla were abandoned . The rail line from Carbona was abandoned by the Western Pacific Railroad in January 1916 . In 1916 the company was sold to Gladding , McBean of Lincoln , California .

  "/wiki/San_Joaquin_River": "The San Joaquin River ( /\u02ccs\u00e6n hw\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ki\u02d0n/ ; Spanish : R\u00edo San Joaqu\u00edn ) is the longest river of Central California in the United States . The 366-mile ( 589 km ) long river starts in the high Sierra Nevada , and flows through the rich agricultural region of the northern San Joaquin Valley before reaching Suisun Bay , San Francisco Bay , and the Pacific Ocean . An important source of irrigation water as well as a wildlife corridor , the San Joaquin is among the most heavily dammed and diverted of California 's rivers . People have inhabited the San Joaquin Valley for more than 8,000 years , and it was long one of the major population centers of pre-Columbian California . Starting in the late 18th century , successive waves of explorers then settlers , mainly Spanish and American , emigrated to the San Joaquin basin , first exploiting then driving out the indigenous tribes . The newcomers quickly appropriated the rich natural and hydrologic resources of the watershed for use in farms and cities , but found themselves plagued by flood and drought . Because of the uniform topography of the San Joaquin Valley , floods once transformed much of the lower river into a huge inland sea . In the 20th century , many levees and dams were built on the San Joaquin and all of its major tributaries . These engineering works changed the fluctuating nature of the river forever , and cut off the Tulare Basin from the rest of the San Joaquin watershed . Once habitat for hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds , today the river is subject to tremendous water-supply , navigation and regulation works by various federal agencies , which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Stockton_Assembly_Center": "The internment of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II was the forced relocation and incarceration in concentration camps in the western interior of the country of about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast . Sixty-two percent of the internees were United States citizens . These actions were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt shortly after Imperial Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor . Of 127,000 Japanese Americans living in the continental United States at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack , 112,000 resided on the West Coast . About 80,000 were Nisei ( literal translation : second generation ; American-born Japanese with U.S. citizenship ) and Sansei ( third generation ; the children of Nisei ) . The rest were Issei ( first generation ) immigrants born in Japan who were ineligible for U.S. citizenship under U.S. law . Japanese Americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics . More than 112,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were forced into interior camps . However , in Hawaii , where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population , only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned . The internment is considered to have resulted more from racism than from any security risk posed by Japanese Americans . California defined anyone with 1/16th or more Japanese lineage as sufficient to be interned . Colonel Karl Bendetsen , the architect behind the program , went so far as saying anyone with one drop of Japanese blood qualified ."
