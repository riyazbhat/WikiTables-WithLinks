  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

  "/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)": "Thomas Sturges Watson ( born September 4 , 1949 ) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour Champions , formerly on the PGA Tour . In the 1970s and 1980s , Watson was one of the leading players in the world , winning eight major championships and heading the PGA Tour money list five times . He was the number one player in the world according to McCormack 's World Golf Rankings from 1978 until 1982 ; in both 1983 and 1984 , he was ranked second behind Seve Ballesteros . He also spent 32 weeks in the top 10 of the successor Sony Rankings in their debut in 1986 . Watson is also notable for his longevity : at nearly sixty years of age , and 26 years after his last major championship victory , he led after the second and third rounds of The Open Championship in 2009 , but lost in a four-hole playoff . With a chance to win the tournament with par on the 72nd hole , he missed an 8-foot ( 2.4 m ) putt , then lost to Stewart Cink in the playoff . Several of Watson 's major victories came at the expense of Jack Nicklaus , the man he replaced as number one , most notably the 1977 Masters , 1977 Open Championship , and the 1982 U.S. Open . Though his rivalry with Nicklaus was intense , their friendly competitiveness served to increase golf 's popularity during the time . In Watson 's illustrious career , his eight major championships include five Open Championships , two Masters titles , and one U.S. Open title . The only major that has eluded him is the PGA Championship , which would put him in an elite group of golfing career grand slam winners that includes Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , Jack Nicklaus , and Tiger Woods . In all , Watson 's eight majors ranks sixth on the list of total major championship victories , behind only Nicklaus , Woods , Walter Hagen , Hogan , and Player . Watson is also regarded as one of the greatest links players of all time , a claim backed up by his five Open Championship victories , his runner-up finishes at the 1984 Open Championship and 2009 Open Championship , and his three Senior British Open Championship titles in his mid-50s ( 2003 , 2005 , and 2007 ) .",

  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

Norman had barely missed a birdie opportunity on the 72nd hole which would have won him the tournament in regulation . The playoff began on the par-4 10th hole , where the approach shots of Ballesteros and Norman came to rest on the fringe , and Mize 's was on the green , below the hole . Ballesteros failed to par and was eliminated while Norman two-putted for four . Mize 's uphill birdie putt came up short and he tapped in to continue with Norman . Both of their tee shots were in the fairway on the next hole , the par-4 11th , but with the pond on the left of the green , Mize 's avoidant approach shot was about pin-high but well right , about from the hole . Norman then played conservatively to the right fringe , with a putt , sensing a par could win the green jacket . But Mize chipped in for an improbable birdie 3 and a stunned Norman failed to hole his to tie , which ended the Mize was the first , and only winner of the Masters to come from Augusta .

Coody won two regular PGA Tour events early in his career and was known as one of the best iron players of his era . However he was considered somewhat of an underachiever until his Masters victory . In the words of his contemporary Frank Beard , Charlie 's one of our better shotmakers but he tries hard not to win . Coody held the lead at the 1969 Masters Tournament with three holes left but finished bogey-bogey-bogey to tie for 5th place . At the 1971 Masters Tournament , Coody opened with a 3 shot lead . He remained in the lead entering the final round but was expected to lose to co-leader Jack Nicklaus who had won the 1971 PGA Championship two months earlier .
