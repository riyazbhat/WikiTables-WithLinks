The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times , with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia . Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East , including Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Arabs constitute the majority ethnic group in the region , followed by Turks , Persians , Kurds , Azeris , Copts , Jews , Assyrians , Iraqi Turkmen , and Greek Cypriots . The Middle East generally has a hot , arid climate , with several major rivers providing irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas such as the Nile Delta in Egypt , the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia ( Iraq , Kuwait , and eastern Syria ) , and most of what is known as the Fertile Crescent . The most populous countries in the region are Egypt , Iran , and Turkey , while Saudi Arabia is the largest Middle Eastern country by area . Most of the countries that border the Persian Gulf have vast reserves of crude oil , with monarchs of the Arabian Peninsula in particular benefiting economically from petroleum exports .",
  "/wiki/North_Africa": "North Africa is a region encompassing the northern portion of the African continent . There is no singularly accepted scope for the region , and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west , to Egypt 's Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east . Others [ Like whom ? ] have limited it to the countries of Algeria , Morocco , and Tunisia , a region that was known by the French during colonial times as Afrique du Nord and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb ( West , The western part of Arab World ) . The most commonly accepted definition includes Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , and Sudan , the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent . Meanwhile , North Africa , particularly when used in the term North Africa and the Middle East , often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb and Libya . Egypt , being also part of the Middle East , is often considered separately , due to being both North African and Middle Eastern at the same time . North Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions , Plazas de soberan\u00eda , Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands and Madeira . The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region . Northwest Africa has been inhabited by Berbers since the beginning of recorded history , while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the Egyptians . Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s , Arabs from the Middle East swept across the region in a wave of Muslim conquest . These peoples , physically quite similar , formed a single population in many areas , as Berbers and Egyptians merged into Arabic and Muslim culture .",

  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",
