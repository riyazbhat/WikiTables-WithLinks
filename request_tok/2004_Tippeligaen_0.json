  "/wiki/Odd_Stadion": "The Skagerak Arena is a football stadium located in Skien , Norway . It was formerly called Odd Stadion , and was built in 1923 as the home ground of Eliteserien club Odd . The stadium is often referred to as Falkum , being situated in that area of Skien . The stadium has been undergoing an extensive redevelopment process , begun in November 2006 , which produced a modern all-seater venue by April 2008 . Part of the finance Odd needed for the project was obtained through the lease of the stadium 's naming rights to the club 's main sponsor since 1995 , the Norwegian power company Skagerak Energi . The stadium will therefore be known as Skagerak Arena until at least 2017 . The pitch has been rotated 90 degrees in order to free up space . As is increasingly common in Norway , the new surface is artificial . The old main stand is now an end stand , incorporated into the new structure as the only surviving feature of the old stadium . Three new two-tiered stands was completed between 2007 and 2008 . The east and west stands has a capacity of 4,300 while the south end seats around 3,000 . Construction of the west stand had progressed far enough by April 2007 to allow spectators on the lower tier for the first home match of the season , on 15 April",
