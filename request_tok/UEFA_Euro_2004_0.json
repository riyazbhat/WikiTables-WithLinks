During this time , Portugal was not part of a group of teams that were candidates to win titles , but from 2000 until this present day , the team evolved , being present in all the final stages of major tournaments , due to the presence of several world-class players such as Lu\u00eds Figo , Rui Costa , Deco , Ricardo Carvalho , and Cristiano Ronaldo , who were dubbed as Portugal 's golden generation , who were considered as the best of the world at their time and among the best in history . Portugal 's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000 , losing 2-1 after extra time to eventual winners France , securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil , as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France , after a penalty , leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament , after losing to 3-1 to hosts Germany , thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup . Despite losing many players of the golden generation , new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o , Jo\u00e3o Moutinho , Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012 , losing to Spain in penalties , with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals .

Two years later at Euro 2016 , Santos brought Portugal its first ever major trophy , defeating hosts France 1-0 after extra time , with the winning goal scored by Eder .
