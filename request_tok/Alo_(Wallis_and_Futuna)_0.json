  "/wiki/Village": "A village is a clustered human settlement or community , larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town ( although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns ) , with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand . Though villages are often located in rural areas , the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods . Villages are normally permanent , with fixed dwellings ; however , transient villages can occur . Further , the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another , not scattered broadly over the landscape , as a dispersed settlement",
  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area . The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area , and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas . In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race . Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations . Population , in a more simple term , is the number of people in a city or town , region , country or world ; population is usually determined by a process called census ( a process of collecting , analyzing , compiling and publishing data )",

Across the world , areas known as districts vary greatly in size , spanning regions or counties , several municipalities , subdivisions of municipalities , school district , or political district",
  "/wiki/Island": "An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water . Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets , skerries , cays or keys . An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait , and a small island off the coast may be called a holm . Sedimentary islands in the Ganges delta are called chars . A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands , such as the Philippines , is referred to as an archipelago . An island may be described as such , despite the presence of an artificial land bridge ; examples are Singapore and its causeway , and the various Dutch delta islands , such as IJsselmonde . Some places may even retain island in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill , such as Coney Island and Coronado Island , though these are , strictly speaking , tied islands . Conversely , when a piece of land is separated from the mainland by a man-made canal , for example the Peloponnese by the Corinth Canal , more or less the entirety of Fennoscandia by the White Sea Canal , or Marble Hill in northern Manhattan during the time between the building of the United States Ship Canal and the filling-in of the Harlem River which surrounded the area , it is generally not considered an island . There are two main types of islands in the sea : continental and oceanic . There are also artificial islands",
