Dale , 530 U.S. 640 ( 2000 ) , was a case of the Supreme Court of the United States , decided on June 28 , 2000 , that held that the constitutional right to freedom of association allowed the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) to exclude a homosexual person from membership in spite of a state law requiring equal treatment of homosexuals in public accommodations . More generally , the court ruled that a private organization such as the BSA may exclude a person from membership when the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group 's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints . In a five to four decision , the Supreme Court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of BSA 's expressive message and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message . The ruling reversed a decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court that had determined that New Jersey 's public accommodations law required the BSA to readmit assistant Scoutmaster James Dale , who had come out and whom the BSA had expelled from the organization for that reason .",
  "/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": "The Supreme Court of the United States ( SCOTUS ) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States . It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution . It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it . When in majority , the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court ; otherwise , the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

  "/wiki/Charles_Duke": "Charles Moss Duke Jr. ( born October 3 , 1935 ) is an American former astronaut , U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) officer and test pilot . As lunar module pilot of Apollo 16 in 1972 , he became the tenth and youngest person to walk on the Moon . A 1957 graduate of the United States Naval Academy , he joined the USAF . He completed advanced flight training on the F-86 Sabre at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia , where he was a distinguished graduate . After completion of this training , Duke served three years as a fighter pilot with the 526th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany . After graduating from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in September 1965 , he stayed on as an instructor teaching control systems and flying in the F-101 Voodoo , F-104 Starfighter , and T-33 Shooting Star . In April 1966 , Duke was one of nineteen men selected for NASA 's fifth group of astronauts . In 1969 , he was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10 . He served as CAPCOM for Apollo 11 , the first crewed landing on the Moon . His distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world as the voice of a Mission Control made nervous by a long landing that almost expended all of the lunar module Eagle 's fuel . Duke 's first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were flustered , Roger , Twank.Tranquility , we copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_16": "Apollo 16 was the tenth crewed mission in the United States Apollo space program , the fifth and second-to-last to land on the Moon , and the second to land in the lunar highlands . The second of Apollo 's J missions , it was crewed by Commander John Young , Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly . Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16 , 1972 , the mission lasted 11 days , 1 hour , and 51 minutes , and concluded at 2:45 p.m. EST on April 27 . Young and Duke spent 71 hours - just under three days - on the lunar surface , during which they conducted three extra-vehicular activities or moonwalks , totaling 20 hours and 14 minutes . The pair drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle ( LRV ) , the second produced and used on the Moon , for 26.7 kilometers ( 16.6 mi ) . On the surface , Young and Duke collected 95.8 kilograms ( 211 lb ) of lunar samples for return to Earth , while Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly orbited in the command and service module ( CSM ) above to perform observations . Mattingly , staying with the command module , spent 126 hours and 64 revolutions in lunar orbit . After Young and Duke rejoined Mattingly in lunar orbit , the crew released a subsatellite from the service module ( SM ) . During the return trip to Earth , Mattingly performed a one-hour spacewalk to retrieve several film cassettes from the exterior of the service module . Apollo 16 's landing spot in the highlands was chosen to allow the astronauts to gather geologically older lunar material than the samples obtained in three of the first four Moon landings , which were in or near lunar maria ( Apollo 14 landed in the Fra Mauro Highlands ) . Samples from the Descartes Formation and the Cayley Formation disproved a hypothesis that the formations were volcanic in origin .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Apollo_astronauts": "NASA assigned 32 American astronauts to the Apollo lunar landing program , and 24 , flying on nine missions between December 1968 and December 1972 , orbited the Moon . During six two-man landing missions twelve astronauts walked on the lunar surface , and six of those drove Lunar Roving Vehicles . Three flew to the Moon twice , one orbiting both times and two landing once apiece . Apart from these 24 men , no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit . The Apollo program included three other crewed missions . Apollo 1 did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire , and Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit missions testing spacecraft components and docking maneuvers . Nine astronauts later flew unused Apollo command modules in the Apollo Applications Program 's Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project . Of the 24 astronauts who flew to the Moon , two went on to command a Skylab mission , one commanded Apollo-Soyuz , one flew as commander for Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle , and two commanded orbital Space Shuttle missions . Twenty-four NASA astronauts from the Apollo era flew on the Space Shuttle .",

  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Kwajalein": "The Battle of Kwajalein was fought as part of the Pacific campaign of World War II . It took place from 31 January - 3 February 1944 , on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands . Employing the hard-learned lessons of the Battle of Tarawa , the United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north . The Japanese defenders put up stiff resistance , although outnumbered and under-prepared . The determined defense of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500 . For the US , the battle represented both the next step in its island-hopping march to Japan and a significant morale victory because it was the first time the Americans had penetrated the outer ring of the Japanese Pacific sphere . For the Japanese , the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense . Japanese defenses became prepared in depth , and the Battles of Peleliu , Guam , and the Marianas proved far more costly to the US ."
