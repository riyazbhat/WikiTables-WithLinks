  "/wiki/Battle_of_Piperdean": "The Battle of Piperdean ( 1435 ) was an engagement in the Scottish Borders , fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England . An English force led by George de Dunbar , 11th Earl of March and Henry Percy , 2nd Earl of Northumberland attempted to take the forfeited Dunbar 's Castle of Dunbar , back from William Douglas , 2nd Earl of Angus who as Warden of the Scottish Marches had invested the castle the previous summer . Percy and Dunbar came north with some 4000 men . Angus did not want to undergo a siege , and decided to pre-empt the English by attacking them en route . An army of roughly the same force surprised the English , under Angus , Adam Hepburn of Hailes , Alexander Elphinstone of that ilk and Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie . Although an overwhelming Scots victory , there is some confusion as to casualties and prisoners taken . Ridpath states that the Scots lost 200 men including Elphinstone , with Brenan concurring about this 'trifling ' amount , whilst stating that the English fatalities were to the tune of 1500 men , including 40 knights . Northumberland retreated to Alnwick Castle , but it was not long before he returned to Scotland to successfully relieve Roxburgh Castle , under siege by King James",
  "/wiki/Berwickshire": "Berwickshire is a historic county , registration county and lieutenancy area in the Scottish Borders . It takes its name from Berwick-upon-Tweed , which was part of Scotland at the time of the county 's formation , but became part of England in 1482 after several centuries of being fought over and swapping back and forth between the two kingdoms . Formerly the county was often called the Merse , from Old English m\u01e3res , border . From 1596 to 1890 the county town was Greenlaw . However , this was changed to Duns by the Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1889 , the act which established the system of county councils in Scotland . The county borders Midlothian to the west , East Lothian to the north , the North Sea to the east and Roxburghshire and the English county of Northumberland to the south",
  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_England": "The Kingdom of England ( Anglo-Norman : Realme d'Engleterre , French : Royaume d'Angleterre ) was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from 927 , when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . On 12 July 927 , the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927-939 ) to form the Kingdom of England . In 1016 , the kingdom became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre . Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066-1154 , Plantagenet 1154-1485 , Tudor 1485-1603 and Stuart 1603-1707 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649-1660 ) . Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became more English in nature ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor . The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327-1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government - in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558-1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World . From the accession of James VI and I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland",

  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .

  "/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai": "The War of the League of Cambrai , sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names , was a major conflict in the Italian Wars of 1494-1559 . The main participants of the war , fought from 1508 to 1516 , were France , the Papal States and the Republic of Venice , joined at various times by nearly every significant power in Western Europe , including Spain , the Holy Roman Empire , England , the Duchy of Milan , the Republic of Florence , the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss mercenaries . Pope Julius II , intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy , brought together the League of Cambrai - an anti-Venetian alliance consisting of himself , Louis XII of France , Ferdinand II of Aragon and Maximilian I , the Holy Roman Emperor - in December 1508 . Although the League was initially successful , friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510 ; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France . The Veneto-Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League , which drove the French from Italy in 1512 ; disagreements about the division of the spoils , however , led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France . Under the leadership of Francis I , who had succeeded Louis on the throne of France , the French and Venetians would , through victory at Marignano in 1515 , regain the territory they had lost ; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels , which ended the war the next year , would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508",
