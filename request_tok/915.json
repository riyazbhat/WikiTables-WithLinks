  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Western_Hockey_League_(1952\u201374)": "The Western Hockey League ( WHL ) was a minor pro ice hockey league that operated from its 1952-1953 season through the 1973-1974 season . Managed for most of its history by Al Leader , it was originally the Pacific Coast Hockey League ( PCHL ) , which had absorbed three teams from the Western Canada Senior Hockey League for the 1951-1952 season before renaming itself one year later . During the 1960s , the WHL moved into a number of large west coast markets including Los Angeles and San Francisco . There was speculation that the WHL could grow into a major league capable of rivalling even the long-entrenched National Hockey League . In the 1965-66 and 1967-68 seasons , the WHL played an interlocking schedule with the American Hockey League . Fears that the WHL ( or a WHL/AHL merger ) could become a rival major league was among the factors that finally convinced the National Hockey League to expand for the 1967-68 season . Several factors led to the WHL 's decision to cease operations after the 1973-74 season . The NHL and World Hockey Association had moved into many of its traditional markets , and the talent pool had become strained by the fast growth in the number of professional teams . When the NHL announced in June 1974 that the owners of both the Denver Spurs and Seattle Totems had been granted conditional NHL franchises ( neither of which came to fruition ) , the WHL announced the same day that it was folding . A few of its surviving teams were absorbed into the Central Hockey League ( CHL ) , though the Phoenix Roadrunners franchise did join the WHA for the 1974-75 season , and the Denver Spurs would jump from the CHL to the WHA for the 1975-76 season ( but folded mid-season ) .
