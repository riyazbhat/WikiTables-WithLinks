  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)": "The Liberal Party was one of the two major parties in the United Kingdom with the opposing Conservative Party in the 19th and early 20th centuries . The party arose from an alliance of Whigs and free trade-supporting Peelites and the reformist Radicals in the 1850s . By the end of the 19th century , it had formed four governments under William Gladstone . Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule , the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in the following year 's general election . Under prime ministers Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman ( 1905-1908 ) and H. H. Asquith ( 1908-1916 ) , the Liberal Party passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state . Although Asquith was the party 's leader , its dominant figure was David Lloyd George . Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister and Lloyd George replaced him as prime minister in late 1916 , but Asquith remained as Liberal Party leader . The pair fought for years over control of the party , badly weakening it in the process . In The Oxford Companion to British History , historian Martin Pugh argues :",

In many countries with bicameral parliaments , this category includes specifically members of the lower house , as upper houses often have a different title .

  "/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)": "The Liberal Democrats ( Lib Dems ) are a liberal political party in the United Kingdom . The party currently has 11 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons , 94 members of the House of Lords , five Members of the Scottish Parliament and one member in each of the Welsh Assembly and the London Assembly . It was in a coalition government with the Conservative Party from 2010-15 . In 1981 , an electoral alliance was established between the Liberal Party , a group which was the direct descendant of the 18th-century Whigs , and the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , a splinter group from the Labour Party . In 1988 , the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats , adopting their present name over a year later . Under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and later Charles Kennedy , the party grew during the 1990s and 2000s , focusing its campaigns on specific seats and becoming the third-largest party in the House of Commons . Under the leadership of Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrats were junior partners in David Cameron 's Conservative-led coalition government in which Clegg served as Deputy Prime Minister . Although it allowed them to implement some of their policies , the coalition damaged the Liberal Democrats ' electoral prospects and it suffered heavy losses at the 2015 general election . Since then , under the leaderships of Tim Farron , Sir Vince Cable and Jo Swinson , it has refocused itself as a party opposing Brexit . Positioned in the centre ground of British politics , the Liberal Democrats ideologically draw upon both liberalism and social democracy . Different factions have dominated the party at different points in its history , each with its own ideological bent , some leaning towards the centre-left and others the centre-right . The party calls for constitutional reform , including a transition from the first-past-the-post voting system to proportional representation",
  "/wiki/Representative_peer": "In the United Kingdom , representative peers were those peers elected by the members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland to sit in the British House of Lords . Until 1999 , all members of the Peerage of England held the right to sit in the House of Lords ; they did not elect a limited group of representatives . All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right to sit in the House of Lords . Representative peers were introduced in 1707 , when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain . At the time there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers . The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element , and consequently the election of a small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated . A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801 . Scotland was allowed to elect sixteen representative peers , while Ireland could elect twenty-eight . Those chosen by Scotland sat for the life of one Parliament , and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected . In contrast , Irish representative peers sat for life . Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922 . However , already-elected Irish peers continued to be entitled to sit until their death",

  "/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain": "Joseph Chamberlain ( 8 July 1836 - 2 July 1914 ) was a British statesman who was first a radical Liberal , then , after opposing home rule for Ireland , a Liberal Unionist , and eventually served as a leading imperialist in coalition with the Conservatives . He split both major British parties in the course of his career . Chamberlain made his career in Birmingham , first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable mayor of the city . He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers ' money . As a self-made businessman , he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy . He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age , relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds . Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation , he served as President of the Board of Trade in Gladstone 's Second Government ( 1880-85 ) . At the time , Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury , and in the 1885 general election he proposed the Unauthorised Programme , which was not enacted , of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers , including the slogan promising three acres and a cow . Chamberlain resigned from Gladstone 's Third Government in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule . He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist , a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham . From the 1895 general election the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party , under Chamberlain 's former opponent Lord Salisbury .

  "/wiki/General_Secretary": "Secretary is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of authority , power , or importance in the organization . Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization . The term is derived from the Latin word secernere , to distinguish or to set apart , the passive participle ( secretum ) meaning having been set apart , with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential , as with the English word secret . A secretarius was a person , therefore , overseeing business confidentially , usually for a powerful individual ( a king , pope , etc. ) . The official title of the leader of most communist and socialist political parties is the General Secretary of the Central Committee or First Secretary of the Central Committee . When a communist party is in power , the General Secretary is usually the country 's de facto leader ( though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power , such as a presidency or premiership in order to constitute de jure leadership of the state ) , such as China and Cuba . In England , the term secretarius was used from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk , an ambassador , or a member of the king 's council . In the fourteenth century , the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king 's signet . From the Renaissance to the late 19th century , men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary . With time , like many titles , the term was applied to more and varied functions , leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use , like general secretary or financial secretary . In some countries , such as the United States , the term secretary is used to indicate the holder of a cabinet-level post . There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority , such as general secretary ( or , following usage in the Norman language , secretary-general ) , first secretary , and executive secretary",
