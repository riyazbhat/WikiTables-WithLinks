  "/wiki/Teruel": "Teruel ( Spanish pronunciation : [ te\u02c8\u027ewel ] ) is a city in Aragon , located in eastern Spain , and is also the capital of Teruel Province . It has a population of 35,675 in 2014 making it the least populated provincial capital in the country . It is noted for its harsh climate , with a very big daily variation on temperatures and its renowned jam\u00f3n serrano ( cured ham ) , its pottery , its surrounding archaeological sites , rock outcrops containing some of the oldest dinosaur remains of the Iberian Peninsula , and its famous events : La Vaquilla del \u00c1ngel during the weekend ( Friday to Monday ) closest to 10 July and Bodas de Isabel de Segura around the third weekend of February . Teruel is regarded as the town of mud\u00e9jar ( Moorish-influenced architecture ) due to numerous buildings designed in this style . All of them are comprised in the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO . Teruel 's remote and mountainous location 915 metres ( 3,002 feet ) above sea level and its low population has led to relative isolation within Spain . A campaign group with the slogan Teruel existe ( Teruel exists ) was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province . Due in part to the campaign , transport connections to Teruel are being greatly improved with the construction of a motorway between Zaragoza and Sagunto , large parts of which are now open . However , Teruel remains the only provincial capital in peninsular Spain without a direct railway link to the capital , Madrid .",

Its population is 38,881 ( INE , 2017 ) , 43.7 % of the provincial population . The municipality has a surface area of 271,77 km2 , with a density of 144.13 inhabitants/km2 . Situated at about 1063 metres above sea level , Soria is the second highest provincial capital in Spain . Although there are remains of settlements from the Iron Age and Celtiberian times , Soria itself enters history with its repopulation between 1109 and 1114 , by the Aragonese king Alfonso I the Battler . A strategic enclave due to the struggles for territory between the kingdoms of Castile , Navarre and Aragon , Soria became part of Castile definitively in 1134 , during the reign of Alfonso VII . In Soria was born Alfonso VIII , and Alfonso X had his court established when he received the offer to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire . In Soria , the deposed king James IV of Mallorca died , and John I of Castile married . Booming during the Late Middle Ages thanks to its border location and its control over the bovine industry , Soria went into a slow decline over the next few centuries . It was seriously damaged during the Peninsular War . The city preserves an important architectural heritage ( extensive medieval walls , Renaissance palaces and architecturally distinctive Romanesque churches ) and is home to the Numantine Museum ( with pieces from the nearby Celtiberian city of Numantia ) . Today , its population of 38,881 makes Soria the least populated provincial capital of Castile and Le\u00f3n and the second least populated in Spain ( after Teruel ) .",
