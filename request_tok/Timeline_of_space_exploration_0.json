  "/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile": "An intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres ( 3,400 mi ) primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery ( delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads ) . Similarly , conventional , chemical , and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness , but have never been deployed on ICBMs . Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ( MIRVs ) , allowing a single missile to carry several warheads , each of which can strike a different target . Russia , the United States , China , India , Iran and North Korea are the only countries that have operational ICBMs . Early ICBMs had limited precision , which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets , such as cities . They were seen as a safe basing option , one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack . Attacks against military targets ( especially hardened ones ) still demanded the use of a more precise , manned bomber . Second- and third-generation designs ( such as the LGM-118 Peacekeeper ) dramatically improved accuracy to the point where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked . ICBMs are differentiated by having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles : intermediate-range ballistic missiles ( IRBMs ) , medium-range ballistic missiles ( MRBMs ) , short-range ballistic missiles ( SRBMs ) and tactical ballistic missiles ( TBMs ) . Short and medium-range ballistic missiles are known collectively as theatre ballistic missiles",
  "/wiki/Soviet_space_program": "The Space program of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( Russian : \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ; translit . Kosmicheskaya programma v SSSR ) , best known as the Soviet space program , was the national space program of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) active from 1930s until disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The Soviet Union 's space program was mainly based on the cosmonautic exploration of space and the development of the expandable launch vehicles , which had been split between many design bureaus competing against each other . Over its 60-years of history , the Russian program was responsible for a number of pioneering feats and accomplishments in the human space flight , including the first intercontinental ballistic missile ( R-7 ) , first satellite ( Sputnik 1 ) , first animal in Earth orbit ( the dog Laika on Sputnik 2 ) , first human in space and Earth orbit ( cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1 ) , first woman in space and Earth orbit ( cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6 ) , first spacewalk ( cosmonaut Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 ) , first Moon impact ( Luna 2 ) , first image of the far side of the Moon ( Luna 3 ) and uncrewed lunar soft landing ( Luna 9 ) , first space rover ( Lunokhod 1 ) , first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth ( Luna 16 ) , and first space station ( Salyut 1 ) . Further notable records included the first interplanetary probes : Venera 1 and Mars 1 to fly by Venus and Mars , respectively , Venera 3 and Mars 2 to impact the respective planet surface , and Venera 7 and Mars 3 to make soft landings on these planets . The rocket and space program of the USSR , initially boosted by the assistance of captured scientists from the advanced German rocket program , was performed mainly by Soviet engineers and scientists after 1955 , and was based on some unique Soviet and Imperial Russian theoretical developments , many derived by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , sometimes known as the father of theoretical astronautics . Sergey Korolev ( also transliterated as Korolyov ) was the head of the principal design group ; his official title was chief designer ( a standard title for similar positions in the USSR ) . Unlike its American competitor in the Space Race , which had NASA as a single coordinating agency , the USSR 's program was split among several competing design bureaus led by S.P.Korolev , Kerim Kerimov , Mikhail Yangel , Valentin Glushko , Vladimir Chelomei , Viktor Makeyev , Mikhail Reshetnev . Because of the program 's classified status , and for propaganda value , announcements of the outcomes of missions were delayed until success was certain , and failures were sometimes kept secret . Ultimately , as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of glasnost in the 1980s , many facts about the space program were declassified . Notable setbacks included the deaths of Korolev , Vladimir Komarov ( in the Soyuz 1 crash ) , Yuri Gagarin ( on a routine fighter jet mission ) and the Soyuz 11 crew between 1966 and 1971 , and development failure of the huge N-1 rocket ( 1968-1973 ) intended to power a crewed lunar landing , which exploded shortly after lift-off on four uncrewed tests . With the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia and Ukraine inherited the program",
  "/wiki/R-7_Semyorka": "The R-7 ( Russian : \u0420-7 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u0440\u043a\u0430 ) was a Soviet missile developed during the Cold War , and the world 's first intercontinental ballistic missile . The R-7 made 28 launches between 1957 and 1961 , but was never deployed operationally . A derivative , the R-7A , was deployed from 1959 to 1968 . To the West it was known by the NATO reporting name SS-6 Sapwood and within the Soviet Union by the GRAU index 8K71 . In modified form , it launched Sputnik 1 , the first artificial satellite , into orbit , and became the basis for the R-7 family which includes Sputnik , Luna , Molniya , Vostok , and Voskhod space launchers , as well as later Soyuz variants . The widely used nickname for the R-7 launcher , Semyorka , means the 7 in Russian",
  "/wiki/Satellite": "In the context of spaceflight , a satellite is an object that has been intentionally placed into orbit . These objects are called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth 's Moon . On 4 October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 . Since then , about 8,900 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched . According to a 2018 estimate , some 5,000 remain in orbit . Of those about 1,900 were operational , while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris . Approximately 63 % of operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit , 6 % are in medium-Earth orbit ( at 20,000 km ) , 29 % are in geostationary orbit ( at 36,000 km ) and the remaining 2 % are in elliptic orbit . A few large space stations have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit . Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites of the Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , a few asteroids , a comet and the Sun . Satellites are used for many purposes . Among several other applications , they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces , and also take pictures of planets they are launched into . Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites , communications satellites , navigation satellites , weather satellites , and space telescopes",

The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957 , orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died , then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere . It was a 58 cm ( 23 in ) diameter polished metal sphere , with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses . Its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs , and the 65\u00b0 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth . The satellite 's unanticipated success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race , a part of the Cold War . The launch was the beginning of a new era of political , military , technological , and scientific developments . The name Sputnik is Russian for spouse/traveling companion or satellite when interpreted in an astronomical context . Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information . The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit , and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere . Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5 , at the 5th Tyuratam range , in Kazakh SSR ( now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome ) . The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour ( 18,000 mph ; 8,100 m/s ) , taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit . It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz , which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world",
  "/wiki/Orbit": "In physics , an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object , such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet . Normally , orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory , although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory . To a close approximation , planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits , with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse , as described by Kepler 's laws of planetary motion . For most situations , orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics , which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law . However , Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime , with orbits following geodesics , provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion",
  "/wiki/Laika": "Laika ( Russian : \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 ; c. 1954 - 3 November 1957 ) was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space , and the first animal to orbit the Earth . Laika , a stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow , was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into outer space on 3 November 1957 . Little was known about the impact of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika 's mission , and the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed , so Laika 's survival was never expected . Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space , so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions . The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a micro-g environment , paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments . Laika died within hours from overheating , possibly caused by a failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload . The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002 ; instead , it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or , as the Soviet government initially claimed , she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion . On 11 April 2008 , Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika . A small monument in her honour was built near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared Laika 's flight to space . It portrayed a dog standing on top of a rocket . She also appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow",

Laika did n't survive any orbit , she died a few hours after the launch . Launched by the U.S.S.R. , Sputnik 2 was a 4 meters ( 13 feet ) high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters ( 6.6 feet ) that weighed around 500 kg , though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit , bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tonnes . It contained several compartments for radio transmitters , a telemetry system , a programming unit , a regeneration and temperature-control system for the cabin , and scientific instruments . A separate sealed cabin contained the dog Laika . Engineering and biological data were transmitted using the Tral D telemetry system , transmitting data to Earth for a 15-minute period during each orbit . Two photometers were on board for measuring solar radiation ( ultraviolet and x-ray emissions ) and cosmic rays . A 100 line television camera provided images of Laika . Sputnik 2 was launched into space only 32 days after its predecessor Sputnik 1 . Due to the huge success of Sputnik 1 , Nikita Khrushchev ordered Sergei Korolev back to work creating a Sputnik 2 that needed to be ready for space for the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution . The plan for Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 was initiated and presented by Korolev , and was approved in January 1957 . At that time , it was not clear that the Soviets ' main satellite plan ( which would eventually become Sputnik 3 ) would be able to get to space because of the ongoing issues with the R-7 ICBM , which would be needed to launch a satellite of that size",
  "/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt": "A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles , most of which originate from the solar wind , that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet 's magnetic field . Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created . The discovery of the belts is credited to James Van Allen , and as a result , Earth 's belts are known as the Van Allen belts . Earth 's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km ( 400 to 36,040 mi ) above the surface in which region radiation levels vary . Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays . By trapping the solar wind , the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction . The belts are located in the inner region of Earth 's magnetosphere . The belts trap energetic electrons and protons . Other nuclei , such as alpha particles , are less prevalent . The belts endanger satellites , which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone . In 2013 , NASA reported that the Van Allen Probes had discovered a transient , third radiation belt , which was observed for four weeks until it was destroyed by a powerful , interplanetary shock wave from the Sun",

Explorer 1 was launched on January 31 , 1958 at 22:48 Eastern Time ( February 1 , 03:48 UTC ) atop the first Juno booster from LC-26 at the Cape Canaveral Missile Annex , Florida . It was the first spacecraft to detect the Van Allen radiation belt , returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months . It remained in orbit until 1970 , and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the Explorer series . Explorer 1 was given Satellite Catalog Number 4 , and the Harvard designation 1958 Alpha 1 , the forerunner to the modern International Designator",
  "/wiki/Escape_velocity": "In physics ( specifically , celestial mechanics ) , escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for a free , non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body . It is slower the farther away from the body an object is , and slower for less massive bodies . Escape velocity is only required to send a ballistic object on a trajectory that will allow the object to escape the gravity well of the mass M. A rocket moving out of a gravity well does not actually need to attain escape velocity to escape , but could achieve the same result ( escape ) at any speed with a suitable mode of propulsion and sufficient propellant to provide the accelerating force on the object to escape . The escape velocity from Earth is about 11.186 km/s ( 6.951 mi/s ; 40,270 km/h ; 36,700 ft/s ; 25,020 mph ; 21,744 kn ) at the surface . More generally , escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an object 's kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy is equal to zero ; [ nb 1 ] an object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface , nor in a closed orbit ( of any radius ) . With escape velocity in a direction pointing away from the ground of a massive body , the object will move away from the body , slowing forever and approaching , but never reaching , zero speed . Once escape velocity is achieved , no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape . In other words , if given escape velocity , the object will move away from the other body , continually slowing , and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the object 's distance approaches infinity , never to come back . Speeds higher than escape velocity have a positive speed at infinity . Note that the minimum escape velocity assumes that there is no friction ( e.g. , atmospheric drag ) , which would increase the required instantaneous velocity to escape the gravitational influence , and that there will be no future acceleration or deceleration ( for example from thrust or gravity from other objects ) , which would change the required instantaneous velocity . For a spherically symmetric , massive body such as a star , or planet , the escape velocity for that body , at a given distance , is calculated by the formula",
  "/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit": "A heliocentric orbit ( also called circumsolar orbit ) is an orbit around the barycenter of the Solar System , which is usually located within or very near the surface of the Sun . All planets , comets , and asteroids in the Solar System , and the Sun itself are in such orbits , as are many artificial probes and pieces of debris . The moons of planets in the Solar System , by contrast , are not in heliocentric orbits , as they orbit their respective planet ( although the Moon has a convex orbit around the Sun ) . The barycenter of the Solar System , while always very near the Sun , moves through space as time passes , depending on where other large bodies in the Solar System , such as Jupiter and other large gas planets , are located at that time . A similar phenomenon allows the detection of exoplanets by way of the radial-velocity method . The helio- prefix is derived from the Greek word \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , meaning Sun , and also Helios , the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology . The first spacecraft to be put in a heliocentric orbit was Luna 1 in 1959 . An incorrectly timed upper-stage burn caused it to miss its planned impact on the Moon",
  "/wiki/Solar_wind": "The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun , called the corona . This plasma mostly consists of electrons , protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV . The composition of the solar wind plasma also includes a mixture of materials found in the solar plasma : trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei C , N , O , Ne , Mg , Si , S , and Fe . There are also rarer traces of some other nuclei and isotopes such as P , Ti , Cr , Ni , Fe 54 and 56 , and Ni 58,60,62 . Embedded within the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field . The solar wind varies in density , temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude . Its particles can escape the Sun 's gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona , which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field . At a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun , the solar wind reaches speeds of 250 to 750 kilometers per second and is supersonic , meaning it moves faster than the speed of the fast magnetosonic wave . [ citation needed ] The flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic at the termination shock . The Voyager 2 spacecraft crossed the shock more than five times between 30 August and 10 December 2007 . Voyager 2 crossed the shock about a billion kilometers closer to the Sun than the 13.5-billion-kilometer distance where Voyager 1 came upon the termination shock .

Intended as an impactor , Luna 1 was launched as part of the Soviet Luna programme in 1959 , however due to an incorrectly timed upper stage burn during its launch , it missed the Moon , in the process becoming the first spacecraft to leave geocentric orbit . A malfunction in the ground-based control system caused an error in the rocket 's burntime , and the spacecraft missed the target and flew by the Moon at a distance of 5,900 km ( more than three times the Moon 's radius ) at the closest point . Luna 1 then became the first human-made object to reach heliocentric orbit and was then dubbed a new planet and renamed Mechta ( Dream ) .

It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System , and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits ( its primary ) . The Moon is , after Jupiter 's satellite Io , the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known . The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago , not long after Earth . The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia . New research of Moon rocks , although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis , suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought . The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , and thus always shows the same side to Earth , the near side . Because of libration , slightly more than half ( about 59 % ) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth . The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . After the Sun , the Moon is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth 's sky . Its surface is actually dark , although compared to the night sky it appears very bright , with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt .

The spacecraft was launched on 12 September 1959 by the Luna 8K72 . It followed a direct path to the Moon . In addition to the radio transmitters sending telemetry information back to Earth , the spacecraft released a sodium gas cloud so the spacecraft 's movement could be visually observed . On 13 September 1959 , it impacted the Moon 's surface east of Mare Imbrium near the craters Aristides , Archimedes , and Autolycus . It was the first spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon , and the first human-made object to make contact with another celestial body .

It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System , the South Pole-Aitken basin . Both sides of the Moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night ; even so , the far side is sometimes called the dark side of the Moon , where dark is used to mean unseen rather than lacking sunlight . About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to libration . The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959 , when it was photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe . The Soviet Academy of Sciences published the first atlas of the far side in 1960 . The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first humans to see the far side with the naked eye when they orbited the Moon in 1968 . All manned and unmanned soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon , until 3 January 2019 when the Chang ' e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side .

Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards , the historic , never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world , and a tentative Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon was created after image processing improved the pictures . These views showed mountainous terrain , very different from the near side , and only two dark , low-lying regions which were named Mare Moscoviense ( Sea of Moscow ) and Mare Desiderii ( Sea of Desire ) . Mare Desiderii was later found to be composed of a smaller mare , Mare Ingenii ( Sea of Cleverness ) , and several other dark craters . The reason for this difference between the two sides of the Moon is still not fully understood , but it seems that most of the dark lavas that flowed out to produce the maria formed under the Earth-facing half . Luna 3 was followed by the United States with Ranger 7 , Ranger 8 , and Ranger 9"
