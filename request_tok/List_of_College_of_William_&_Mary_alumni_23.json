  "/wiki/Starship_Troopers": "Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein . Written in a few weeks in reaction to the U.S. suspending nuclear tests , the story was first published as a two-part serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as Starship Soldier , and published as a book by G. P. Putnam 's Sons in December 1959 . The story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government dominated by a military elite , referred to as the Terran Federation . The first-person narrative follows Juan Johnny Rico through his military service in the Mobile Infantry . Rico progresses from recruit to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as Arachnids or Bugs . Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues , including aspects of suffrage , civic virtue , juvenile delinquency , and war ; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein 's own political views . Starship Troopers has been identified with a tradition of militarism in U.S. science fiction , and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs , and the Cold War . A coming-of-age novel , Starship Troopers also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s , argues that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline , and advocates corporal and capital punishment . Starship Troopers brought to an end Heinlein 's series of juvenile novels . It became one of his best-selling books , and is considered his most widely known work . It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960 , and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military . It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support",
