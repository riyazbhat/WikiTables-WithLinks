After 52 years in St. Louis , the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro , Jr . The team 's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos .

Nicknames for the team include the O 's and the Birds . The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six World Series appearances , winning three of them ( 1966 , 1970 , 1983 ) . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles , such as third baseman Brooks Robinson , outfielder Frank Robinson , starting pitcher Jim Palmer , first baseman Eddie Murray , shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , and manager Earl Weaver .

  "/wiki/No-hitter": "In baseball , a no-hitter ( also known as a no-hit game and colloquially as a no-no ) is a game in which a team was not able to record a single hit . Major League Baseball ( MLB ) officially defines a no-hitter as a completed game in which a team that batted in at least nine innings recorded no hits . A pitcher who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is said to have thrown a no-hitter . This is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff - only 303 have been thrown in MLB history since 1876 , an average of about two per year . In most cases , no-hitters are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game ; one thrown by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter . The most recent major league no-hitter by a single pitcher was thrown on September 1 , 2019 , by Justin Verlander of the Houston Astros against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre . The most recent combined no-hitter was thrown on August 3 , 2019 , by Aaron Sanchez , Will Harris , Joe Biagini , and Chris Devenski of the Astros against the Seattle Mariners at Minute Maid Park . It is possible to reach base without a hit , most commonly by a walk , error , or being hit by a pitch . Other possibilities include the batter reaching first after an uncaught third strike or catcher 's interference . A no-hitter in which no batters reach base at all is a perfect game , a much rarer feat . Because batters can reach base by means other than a hit , a pitcher can throw a no-hitter ( though not a perfect game ) and still give up runs , and even lose the game , although this is extremely uncommon , and most no-hitters are also shutouts . One or more runs were given up in 25 recorded no-hitters in MLB history , most recently by Ervin Santana of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a 3-1 win against the Cleveland Indians on July 27 , 2011 .",

  "/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)": "A perfect game in Major League Baseball is a game in which a pitcher ( or combination of pitchers ) pitches a victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings and no opposing batter reaches base . To achieve a perfect game , a team must not allow an opposing player to reach base by any means , including hits , walks , hit batsmen , or fielding errors ; in short , 27 up , 27 down ( for a nine-inning game ) . The feat has been achieved 23 times in MLB history - 21 times since the modern era began in 1900 , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . A perfect game is also a no-hitter and a shutout . A fielding error that does not allow a batter to reach base , such as a misplayed foul ball , does not spoil a perfect game . Weather-shortened contests in which a team has no baserunners and games in which a team reaches first base only in extra innings do not qualify as perfect games under the present definition . The first confirmed use of the term perfect game was in ; the term 's current definition was formalized in . Although it is theoretically possible for several pitchers to combine for a perfect game ( as has happened 11 times at the major league level for a no-hitter ) , to date , every major league perfect game has been thrown by a single pitcher . In Eastern Asian leagues such as Nippon Professional Baseball , KBO League , or Chinese Professional Baseball League , only Complete Perfect Games were recorded as official .",
