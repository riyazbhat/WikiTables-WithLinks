The Firebug Working Group oversaw the open source development and extension of Firebug . It had two major implementations : an extension for Mozilla Firefox and a bookmarklet implementation called Firebug Lite which can be used with Google Chrome . In addition to debugging web pages , Firebug was used for web security testing and web page performance analysis . Firebug has been deprecated in favor of the integrated developer tools added to Firefox itself , whose functionality has been unified with those of Firebug . As Firefox 57 no longer supports XUL add-ons , Firebug is no longer compatible",

  "/wiki/Web_scraping": "Web scraping , web harvesting , or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites . Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol , or through a web browser . While web scraping can be done manually by a software user , the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler . It is a form of copying , in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web , typically into a central local database or spreadsheet , for later retrieval or analysis . Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it . Fetching is the downloading of a page ( which a browser does when you view the page ) . Therefore , web crawling is a main component of web scraping , to fetch pages for later processing . Once fetched , then extraction can take place . The content of a page may be parsed , searched , reformatted , its data copied into a spreadsheet , and so on . Web scrapers typically take something out of a page , to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else . An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers , or companies and their URLs , to a list ( contact scraping ) . Web scraping is used for contact scraping , and as a component of applications used for web indexing , web mining and data mining , online price change monitoring and price comparison , product review scraping ( to watch the competition ) , gathering real estate listings , weather data monitoring , website change detection , research , tracking online presence and reputation , web mashup and , web data integration",

  "/wiki/Regular_expression": "A regular expression , regex or regexp ( sometimes called a rational expression ) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern . Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for find or find and replace operations on strings , or for input validation . It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory . The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language . The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities . Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s , one being the POSIX standard and another , widely used , being the Perl syntax . Regular expressions are used in search engines , search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors , in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis . Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries",
  "/wiki/Stylish": "Stylish is a user style manager that can change the appearance of web pages in a user 's browser without changing their content by including user-supplied CSS style sheets with those supplied by the web site itself .

  "/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets": "Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML . CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web , alongside HTML and JavaScript . CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content , including layout , colors , and fonts . This separation can improve content accessibility , provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics , enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file , and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content . Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods , such as on-screen , in print , by voice ( via speech-based browser or screen reader ) , and on Braille-based tactile devices . CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device . The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element . This cascading priority scheme is predictable . The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) . Internet media type ( MIME type ) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 ( March 1998 ) . The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents . In addition to HTML , other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML , plain XML , SVG , and XUL",
