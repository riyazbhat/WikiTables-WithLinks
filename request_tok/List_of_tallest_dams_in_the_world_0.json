  "/wiki/China": "China ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ) , officially the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , is a country in East Asia and is the world 's most populous country , with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017 . Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sasanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire , Mongol Empire , Timurid dynasty , the Khanate of Bukhara , the Russian Empire , and subsequently the Soviet Union . Within the Soviet Union , the country 's modern borders were drawn when it was part of Uzbekistan as an autonomous republic before becoming a full-fledged Soviet republic in 1929 .

A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow . Like all other Central Asian neighbouring states , the country , led by President Emomali Rahmon since 1994 , has been criticised by a number of non-governmental organizations for authoritarian leadership , lack of religious freedom , corruption and widespread violations of human rights .

One of the tallest dams in the world , it is 262 metres ( 860 ft ) high , 27 metres ( 89 ft ) wide and 22.11 metres ( 72 ft 6 in ) thick at the base and 191 metres ( 627 ft ) wide and 3.4 metres ( 11 ft 2 in ) thick at the top . The dam was conceived in the 1920s , designed by Carlo Semenza , and eventually built between 1957 and 1960 by Societ\u00e0 Adriatica di Elettricit\u00e0 ( SADE , or EDIS ) ( English : Adriatic Energy Corporation ) , the electricity supply and distribution monopoly in northeastern Italy , which was owned by Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata . In 1962 the dam was nationalized and came under the control of ENEL as part of the Italian Ministry for Public Works . It was described as 'the tallest dam in the world ' , intended to meet the growing demands of industrialization , and as of 2010 is still one of the tallest in the world . On 9 October 1963 , during initial filling , a massive landslide caused a man-made megatsunami in the lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of 250 metres ( 820 ft ) , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns , and 1,917 deaths . This event occurred when the company and the Italian government dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin , and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster . Numerous warnings , signs of danger , and negative appraisals had been disregarded , and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it . Although the dam itself remained almost intact , and two-thirds of the water was retained behind it , the landslide was much larger than expected and the impact brought massive flooding and destruction to the Piave valley below . Although the wave only contained a third of the dam 's contents , it was still ten times higher than calculations had predicted . [ citation needed ]",

The Dadu flows from the eastern Tibetan Plateau into the Sichuan Basin where it joins with the Min River , a tributary of the Yangtze River . Measured from its geographic source , the Dadu is actually longer than the Min and thus forms the main stem of the Min River system . Shuangjiangkou Dam , expected to be the tallest dam in the world , is being built on the Dadu River ."
