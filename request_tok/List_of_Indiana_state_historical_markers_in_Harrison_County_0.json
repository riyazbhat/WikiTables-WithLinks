  "/wiki/Battle_of_Corydon": "The Battle of Corydon was a minor engagement that took place July 9 , 1863 , just south of Corydon , which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825 , and was the county seat of Harrison County . The attack occurred during Morgan 's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2,500 cavalry invaded the North in support of the Tullahoma Campaign . It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana , and no battle has occurred within Indiana since . As news of an impending raid spread across the state , Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state 's militia force , the Indiana Legion , to defend against the threat . Unaware of the size of the invading army , four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion , totaling about one hundred men , attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana , but were overcome by superior artillery fire , killing two of the defenders . The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan . Along with the townspeople , they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon . Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany , only about 450 men ( consisting almost entirely of locals ) were defending the town . As the raiders approached from the south , the advance elements formed a battle line and launched a frontal attack and an unsuccessful flanking movement against the east side of the Legion 's works . Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops , giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority . With the support of the artillery , a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded . A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town , while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown",

  "/wiki/Morgan's_Raid": "Morgan 's Raid was a diversionary incursion by Confederate cavalry into the northern ( Union ) states of Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio and , briefly , West Virginia , during the American Civil War . The raid took place from June 11-July 26 , 1863 , and is named for the commander of the Confederates , Brig . Gen. John Hunt Morgan . Although it caused temporary alarm in the North , the raid was ultimately classed as a failure . The raid covered more than 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) , beginning in Tennessee and ending in northern Ohio . It coincided with the Vicksburg Campaign and the Gettysburg Campaign , and it was meant to draw U.S. troops away from these fronts by frightening the North into demanding their troops return home . Despite his initial successes , Morgan was thwarted in his attempts to recross the Ohio River and eventually was forced to surrender what remained of his command in northeastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania border . Morgan and other senior officers were kept in the Ohio state penitentiary , but they tunneled their way out and took a train to Cincinnati , where they crossed the Ohio River to safety",
