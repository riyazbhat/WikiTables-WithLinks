  "/wiki/Orkney": "Orkney /\u02c8\u0254\u02d0rkni/ ( Old Norse : Orkneyjar ) , also known as the Orkney Islands , [ Notes 1 ] is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland , situated off the north coast of the island of Great Britain . Orkney is 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of the coast of Caithness and has about 70 islands , of which 20 are inhabited . The largest island , Mainland , is often referred to as the Mainland , and has an area of 523 square kilometres ( 202 sq mi ) , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles . The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall . Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , a constituency of the Scottish Parliament , a lieutenancy area , and a historic county . The local council is Orkney Islands Council , one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents . [ Notes 2 ] The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years , originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts . Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark . In addition to the Mainland , most of the remaining islands are in two groups , the North and South Isles , all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone . The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile , most of the land being farmed . Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy .",

The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age .

  "/wiki/Iron_Age": "The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity . It was preceded by the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Chalcolithic ) and the Bronze Age . The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East , and , by analogy , also to other parts of the Old World . The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration . It is defined by archaeological convention , and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture ; rather , the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread . For example , Tutankhamun 's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age . In the Ancient Near East , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse , in the 12th century BC . The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia . Its further spread to Central Asia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe is somewhat delayed , and Northern Europe is reached still later , by about 500 BC . The Iron Age is taken to end , also by convention , with the beginning of the historiographical record . This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record ; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC ( considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus ) is usually taken as a cut-off date , and in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age . The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD , with the beginning of the Viking Age .",

The current clan chief is Hugh Macleod of Macleod . It contains the hamlets of Stein and Lusta in Loch Bay to the south east , Halistra , Hallin and Trumpan further north and Gillen to the west , all of which are accessed from the A850 road by crossing the Fairy Bridge . The highest point is Ben Geary ( 284 m ( 932 ft ) ) and the most northerly is Waternish Point . The name Waternish is derived from the Old Norse vatnenes or headland of the pond , via Scottish Gaelic Bh\u00e0tairnis . The history of the peninsula is a long ( and often bloody ) one involving clan feuds , massacres , de-population during the Highland Clearances , and eventual re-vitalisation . Originally consisting of small crofting communities , Waternish now has a growing population and is home to various arts and crafts enterprises . Whilst the main industry on Waternish is tourism , there has also been a revival in recent years of crofting or small-scale agriculture . The local school is called Knockbreck . The school has struggled recently due to an ageing population which has resulted in only 4 students currently attending and the school was scheduled for closure in summer 2015 .

The present town was built between 1805 and 1809 , destroying in the process more than half of the site of an important Pictish hill fort . General Roys map shows the defences as they existed in the 18th century but he wrongly attributed them to the Romans . The fort was probably a major Pictish centre and was where carved slabs depicting bulls were found ; they are known as the Burghead Bulls . A chambered well of some considerable antiquity was discovered in 1809 and walls and a roof were later added to help preserve it . Each year on 11 January a fire festival known as the Burning of the Clavie takes place ; it is thought that the festival dates back to the 17th century , although it could easily predate this by several centuries . Burghead is often known by locals as The Broch , a nickname also applied to Fraserburgh in nearby Aberdeenshire . A recent dig just beyond the boundary of Burghead at Clarkly Hill has uncovered Iron Age circular stone houses and Pictish building foundations , as well as silver and bronze Roman coins and a gold finger ring possibly from the Baltic region .

  "/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)": "The Dark Ages is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages that asserts that a demographic , cultural , and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire . The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era 's darkness ( lack of records ) with earlier and later periods of light ( abundance of records ) . The concept of a Dark Age originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch , who regarded the post-Roman centuries as dark compared to the light of classical antiquity . The phrase Dark Age itself derives from the Latin saeculum obscurum , originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries . The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance ; this became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment . As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and 20th centuries , scholars began restricting the Dark Ages appellation to the Early Middle Ages ( c. 5th-10th century ) , and now scholars also reject its usage in this period . The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations , finding it misleading and inaccurate . The pejorative meaning remains in use , typically in popular culture which often mischaracterises the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness .",

Although there is little literary evidence , archaeological evidence strongly indicates that there was a monastery at Restenneth from very early times . There is also speculation that Restenneth may even have been the Pictish church dedicated to St Peter ( mentioned in Bede ) built in 710 for Necht\u00e1n mac Der Ilei , King of the Picts . Augustinian Restenneth was always a small priory and very dependent on its mother-house at Jedburgh .

There was an attempt to incorporate it into the Royal Chapel in this year , but this failed to occur , and King James IV of Scotland suggested its incorporation into the archbishopric of St Andrews . This too evidently did not occur , as priors continue to be on record . The priory was , however , turned into a secular lordship for Thomas Erskine , Viscount Fentoun , in 1606 .
