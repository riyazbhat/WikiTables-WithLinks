  "/wiki/Hans_Christian_Lumbye": "Hans Christian Lumbye ( ; 2 May 1810 - 20 March 1874 ) was a Danish composer of waltzes , polkas , mazurkas and galops , among other things . As a child , he studied music in Randers and Odense , and by age 14 he was playing the trumpet in a military band . In 1829 , he joined the Horse Guards in Copenhagen , still continuing his music education . In 1839 , he heard a Viennese orchestra play music by Johann Strauss I , after which he composed in the style of Strauss , eventually earning the nickname The Strauss of the North . From 1843 to 1872 , he served as the music director and in-house composer for Tivoli Gardens , Copenhagen . Such was his popularity in the Danish capital that many Danes revered him and considered Johann Strauss II as the Lumbye of the South . Lumbye is best known for his light compositions , many of which evoke non-musical sources . The Champagne Galop , for example , begins with the pop of a champagne cork , and the Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop faithfully recreates the sounds of a train chugging out of a station and grinding to a halt at the next stop . He honored the Swedish Nightingale with a Souvenir de Jenny Lind , Vals from 1845 . He was the father of two musician sons , Carl Christian ( 9 July 1841 - 10 August 1911 ) and Georg August ( 26 August 1843 - 1922 ) , who took over his orchestra after his father 's death .

  "/wiki/Carl_Nielsen": "Carl August Nielsen ( Danish : [ k\u02b0al \u02c8nelsn\u0329 ] ; 9 June 1865 - 3 October 1931 ) was a Danish composer , conductor and violinist , widely recognized as his country 's most prominent composer . Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen , he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age . He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886 . He premiered his Op . 1 , Suite for Strings , in 1888 , at the age of 23 . The following year , Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen , during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi 's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres . In 1916 , he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death . Although his symphonies , concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed , Nielsen 's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties , often reflected in his music . The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his psychological period , resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen . Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies , his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin , flute and clarinet . In Denmark , his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage . His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg , but he soon developed his own style , first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time .",
