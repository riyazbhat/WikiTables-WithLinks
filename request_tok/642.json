  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",

Major Havoc consists of a number of smaller game experiences played in succession , including a fixed shooter , platformer , and a lunar lander sequence . It was developed by Owen Rubin with some levels designed and tuned by Mark Cerny , who joined the development team approximately a year into the game 's development . The game was initially released as a dedicated cabinet in 1983 and then one year later as a conversion kit for older vector arcade games like Tempest . Dedicated versions of the game used a roller control for left-right movement , while conversion kits used their native controller hardware , such as the Tempest rotary spinner knob .",

  "/wiki/Mothership": "A mother ship , mothership or mother-ship is a large vehicle that leads , serves , or carries other smaller vehicles . A mother ship may be a maritime ship , aircraft , or spacecraft . Examples include bombers converted to carry experimental aircraft to altitudes where they can conduct their research ( such as the B-52 carrying the X-15 ) , or ships that carry small submarines to an area of ocean to be explored ( such as the Atlantis II carrying the Alvin ) . A mother ship may also be used to recover smaller craft , or go its own way after releasing them . A smaller vessel serving or caring for larger craft is usually called a tender .",
  "/wiki/Marble_Madness": "Marble Madness is an arcade video game designed by Mark Cerny and published by Atari Games in 1984 . It is a platform game in which the player must guide a marble through six courses , populated with obstacles and enemies , within a time limit . The player controls the marble by using a trackball . Marble Madness is known for using innovative game technologies : it was Atari 's first to use the Atari System 1 hardware , the first to be programmed in the C programming language , and one of the first to use true stereo sound ( previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo ) . In designing the game , Cerny drew inspiration from miniature golf , racing games , and artwork by M. C. Escher . He aimed to create a game that offered a distinct experience with a unique control system . Cerny applied a minimalist approach in designing the appearance of the game 's courses and enemies . Throughout development , he was frequently impeded by limitations in technology and had to forgo several design ideas . Upon its release to arcades , Marble Madness was commercially successful and profitable . Critics praised the game 's difficulty , unique visual design , and stereo soundtrack . The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games . A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991 , but canceled when location testing showed the game could not succeed in competition with other titles .",

  "/wiki/Trackball": "A trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes - like an upside-down mouse with an exposed protruding ball . Users roll the ball to position the on-screen pointer , using their thumb , fingers , or commonly the palm of the hand while using the fingertips to press the mouse buttons . With most trackballs , operators have to lift their finger , thumb or hand and reposition in on the ball to continue rolling , whereas a mouse would have to be lifted itself and re-positioned . Some trackballs have notably low friction , as well as being made of a dense material such as glass , so they can be spun to make them coast . The trackball 's buttons may be situated to that of a mouse or to a unique style that suits the user . Large trackballs are common on CAD workstations for easy precision . Before the advent of the touchpad , small trackballs were common on portable computers ( such as the BlackBerry Tour ) where there may be no desk space on which to run a mouse . Some small thumbballs are designed to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have integral buttons with the same function as mouse buttons .",

Marbles can be used for a variety of games called marbles . They are often collected , both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors . In the North of England the objects and the game are called taws , with larger taws being called bottle washers after the use of a marble in Codd-neck bottles , which were often collected for play . These toys can be used to make marble runs , a form of art , or they can be used to make marble races , a competition where marbles need to compete to win .",

  "/wiki/Shooting_game": "Shooter games are a subgenre of action video game , which often test the player 's spatial awareness , reflexes , and speed in both isolated single player or networked multiplayer environments . Shooter games encompass many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar engaging in combat with a weapon against both code-driven NPC enemies or other avatars controlled by other players . Usually this weapon is a firearm or some other long-range weapon , and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense , armor for additional defense , or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons . A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition , armor or health , or upgrades which augment the player character 's weapons . Most commonly , the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying as a result of the player 's actions . A shooting game is a genre of video game where the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character 's enemies using the weapons given to the player .",
  "/wiki/Terrorist": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",

The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan .
