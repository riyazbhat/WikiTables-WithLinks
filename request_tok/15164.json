The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism , written in the form of an encompassing time line ; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries . Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay , medical , and political communities . Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS , that of Grethe Rask , a Danish doctor working in Africa . He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS , when international attention on the disease exploded .

He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s . Kesey was born in La Junta , Colorado , and grew up in Springfield , Oregon , graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957 . He began writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University ; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later . During this period , Kesey participated in government studies involving hallucinogenic drugs ( including mescaline and LSD ) to supplement his income . Following the publication of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , he moved to nearby La Honda , California , and began hosting happenings with former colleagues from Stanford , miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures ( most notably Neal Cassady ) , and other friends collectively known as the Merry Pranksters ; these parties , known as Acid Tests , integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances . He mentored the Grateful Dead ( the de facto house band of the Acid Tests ) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career . Sometimes a Great Notion - an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner 's Yoknapatawpha saga - was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964 , although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus . In 1965 , following an arrest for marijuana possession and subsequent faked suicide , Kesey was imprisoned for five months . Shortly thereafter , he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill , Oregon , where he maintained a secluded , family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life . In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon - an experience that culminated in Caverns ( 1989 ) , a collaborative novel written by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym of O.U . Levon - he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as Esquire , Rolling Stone , Oui , Running , and The Whole Earth Catalog ; various iterations of these pieces were collected in Kesey 's Garage Sale ( 1973 ) and Demon Box ( 1986 ) .",
