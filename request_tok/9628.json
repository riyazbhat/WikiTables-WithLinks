  "/wiki/Isurium_Brigantum": "Isurium or Isurium of the Brigantes ( Latin : Isurium Brigantum ) was a Roman fort and town in the province of Britannia at the site of present-day Aldborough in North Yorkshire , England , in the United Kingdom . Its remains - the Aldborough Roman Site - are in the care of English Heritage . The Roman road through the town formed a leg of both Dere Street - connecting Eboracum ( York ) to the Antonine Wall - and the Roman equivalent of Watling Street , which here connected Eboracum with Luguvalium ( Carlisle ) . The modern village retains part of the Roman street plan and the church stands on the site of the forum .",

  "/wiki/Abbey": "An abbey is a complex of buildings , a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess . It provides a place for religious activities , work , and housing of Christian monks and nuns . The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them . Religious life in an abbey may be monastic . An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors . The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order . Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy , refuge to the persecuted , or education to the young . Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat . There are many famous abbeys across Europe .",
  "/wiki/Carlton_Towers": "Carlton Towers in the parish of Carlton , 5 miles ( 8 km ) south-east of Selby , North Yorkshire , England , is a very large Grade I listed country house , in the Victorian Gothic-revival style , and is surrounded by a 250-acre park . The house was re-built to its present form in 1873-5 by Henry Stapleton , 9th Baron Beaumont ( 1848-1892 ) , whose father Miles Stapleton , 8th Baron Beaumont ( 1805-1854 ) had in 1840 inherited the title Baron Beaumont , in abeyance since 1507 . His architect was Edward Welby Pugin , who encased and incorporated the earlier manor house dating from 1614 into a larger structure . He sold much of the estate to finance the building work . The 9th Baron died of pneumonia , without issue , and it passed to his younger brother the 10th Baron . The house is now the property of the 10th Baron 's great-grandson Edward Fitzalan-Howard , 18th Duke of Norfolk , 13th Baron Beaumont ( born 1956 ) of Arundel Castle in Sussex , who has allowed it to become the home of his younger brother Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard ( born 1962 ) . The main parts of the house are available for hire for wedding receptions and other events .",
  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Clifford's_Tower": "York Castle is a fortified complex in the city of York , England . It has comprised a sequence of castles , prisons , law courts and other buildings , which were built over the last nine centuries on the south side of the River Foss . The now-ruined keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford 's Tower . Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of J\u00f3rv\u00edk , the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences . After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable , York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929 . The first motte and bailey castle on the site was built in 1068 following the Norman conquest of York . After the destruction of the castle by rebels and a Viking army in 1069 , York Castle was rebuilt and reinforced with extensive water defences , including a moat and an artificial lake . York Castle formed an important royal fortification in the north of England . In 1190 , 150 local Jews were killed in a pogrom in the castle keep ; most of them committed suicide in order not to fall into the hands of the mob . Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone in the middle of the 13th century , creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design , supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse . During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338 , York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England , as well as an important military base of operations . York Castle fell into disrepair by the 15th and 16th centuries , becoming used increasingly as a jail for both local felons and political prisoners .",
  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",

  "/wiki/Gisborough_Priory": "Gisborough Priory is a ruined Augustinian priory in Guisborough in the borough of Redcar and Cleveland and ceremonial county of North Yorkshire , England . It was founded in 1119 as the Priory of St Mary by the Norman feudal magnate Robert de Brus , also an ancestor of the Scottish king , Robert the Bruce . It became one of the richest monastic foundations in England with grants from the crown and bequests from de Brus , other nobles and gentry and local people of more modest means . Much of the Romanesque Norman priory was destroyed in a fire in 1289 . It was rebuilt in the Gothic style on a grander scale over the following century . Its remains are regarded as among the finest surviving examples of early Gothic architecture in England . The priory prospered until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 , when it was abolished along with England 's other monastic communities . The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough . The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch , a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough . It became part of the estate of the Chaloner family , who acquired it in 1550 . The east window was preserved by them as part of a Romantic vista adjoining their seat , Gisborough Hall , from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name . It is owned by the Chaloners but is in the care of English Heritage as a scheduled monument .",
  "/wiki/Priory": "A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress . Priories may be houses of mendicant friars or nuns ( such as the Dominicans , Augustinians , Franciscans , and Carmelites , for instance ) , or monasteries of monks or nuns ( as with the Benedictines ) . Houses of canons regular and canonesses regular also use this term , the alternative being canonry . In pre-Reformation England , if an abbey church was raised to cathedral status , the abbey became a Cathedral Priory . The bishop , in effect , took the place of the abbot , and the monastery itself was headed by a prior .",

  "/wiki/Tower": "A tower is a tall structure , taller than it is wide , often by a significant factor . Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore , along with tall buildings , self-supporting structures . Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions . The principal function is the use of their height to enable various functions to be achieved including : visibility of other features attached to the tower such as clock towers ; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a castle ; as a structure for observation for leisure purposes ; or as a structure for telecommunication purposes . Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building .",
  "/wiki/Middleham_Castle": "Middleham Castle is a ruined castle in Middleham in Wensleydale , in the county of North Yorkshire , England . It was built by Robert Fitzrandolph , 3rd Lord of Middleham and Spennithorne , commencing in 1190 . The castle was the childhood home of King Richard III , although he spent very little of his reign there . The castle was built to defend the road from Richmond to Skipton , though some have suggested the original site of the castle was far better to achieve this than the later location . After the death of King Richard III the castle remained in royal hands until it was allowed to go to ruin in the 17th century .

  "/wiki/Mount_Grace_Priory": "Mount Grace Priory , in the parish of East Harlsey , North Yorkshire , England , within the North York Moors National Park , is today the best preserved and most accessible of the nine medieval Carthusian houses ( charterhouses ) in England . Set in woodlands , it was founded in 1398 by Thomas Holland , 1st Duke of Surrey , the son of King Richard II 's half-brother Thomas , Earl of Kent . It was the last monastery established in Yorkshire , and one of the few founded anywhere in Britain in the period between the Black Death ( 1349-50 ) and the Reformation . It was a fairly small establishment , with space for a prior and twenty-three monks . Mount Grace Priory consisted of a church and two cloisters . The Great Cloister , to the north of the church , had seventeen cells for monks whilst the southern Lesser Cloister had six cells for the lay brothers . Upon the abdication of King Richard II , Holland and others of the king 's supporters attempted to assassinate his recently crowned successor , Henry IV , at New Year , 1400 , but were captured and executed . Holland 's body was eventually recovered and , in 1412 , re-buried in the charterhouse that he had founded . The orphaned priory of Mount Grace , bereft of its founder and the income that had been granted to it by Holland and King Richard , depended upon royal largesse for its income for more than a decade .",

  "/wiki/Church_(building)": "A church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for Christian religious activities , particularly for Christian worship services . The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions . In traditional Christian architecture , a church interior is often structured in the shape of a Christian cross . When viewed from plan view the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center aisle and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the bema and altar . Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers . Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and , conversely , many original church buildings have been put to other uses . The earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256 . From the 11th through the 14th centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe . A cathedral is a church building , usually Roman Catholic , Protestant ( including Anglican ) , Eastern Orthodox , or Oriental Orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop .",
  "/wiki/Scarborough_Castle": "Scarborough Castle is a former medieval Royal fortress situated on a rocky promontory overlooking the North Sea and Scarborough , North Yorkshire , England . The site of the castle , encompassing the Iron Age settlement , Roman signal station , an Anglo-Scandinavian settlement and chapel , the 12th-century enclosure castle and 18th-century battery , is a scheduled monument of national importance . Fortifications for a wooden castle were built in the 1130s , but the present stone castle dates from the 1150s . Over the centuries , several other structures were added , with medieval monarchs investing heavily in what was then an important fortress that guarded the Yorkshire coastline , Scarborough 's port trade , and the north of England from Scottish or continental invasion . It was fortified and defended during various civil wars , sieges and conflicts , as kings fought with rival barons , faced rebellion and clashed with republican forces , though peace with Scotland and the conclusion of civil and continental wars in the 17th century led to its decline in importance .

  "/wiki/Hillforts_in_Britain": "Hillforts in Britain refers to the various hillforts within the island of Great Britain . Although the earliest such constructs fitting this description come from the Neolithic British Isles , with a few also dating to later Bronze Age Britain , British hillforts were primarily constructed during the British Iron Age . Some of these were apparently abandoned in the southern areas that were a part of Roman Britain , although at the same time , those areas of northern Britain that remained free from Roman occupation saw an increase in their construction . Some hillforts were reused in the Early Middle Ages , and in some rarer cases , into the Later Medieval period as well . By the early modern period , these had essentially all been abandoned , with many being excavated by archaeologists in the nineteenth century onward . There are around 3,300 structures that can be classed as hillforts or similar defended enclosures within Britain . Most of these are clustered in certain regions : south and south-west England , the west coast of Wales and Scotland , the Welsh Marches and the Scottish border hills . British hillforts varied in size , with the majority covering an area of less than 1 ha ( 3 acres ) , but with most others ranging from this up to around 12 ha ( 30 acres ) in size . In certain rare cases , they were bigger , with a few examples being over 80 ha ( 200 acres ) in size . Various archaeologists operating in Britain have criticised the use of the term hillfort both because of its perceived connection to fortifications and warfare and because not all such sites were actually located on hills . Leslie Alcock believed that the term enclosed places was more accurate , whilst J. Forde-Johnston commented on his preference for defensive enclosures ."
