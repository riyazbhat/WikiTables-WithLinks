  "/wiki/Handley_Page_Halifax": "The Handley Page Halifax is a British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) four-engined heavy bomber of the Second World War . It was developed by Handley Page to the same specification as the contemporary twin-engine Avro Manchester . The Halifax has its origins in the twin-engine HP56 proposal of the late 1930s , produced in response to the British Air Ministry 's Specification P.13/36 for a capable medium bomber for world-wide use . The HP56 was ordered as a backup to the Avro 679 , both aircraft being designed to use the underperforming Rolls-Royce Vulture engine . The Handley Page design was altered at the Ministry to a four-engine arrangement powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine ; the rival Avro 679 was produced as the twin-engine Avro Manchester which , while regarded as unsuccessful mainly due to the Vulture engine , was a direct predecessor of the famed Avro Lancaster . Both the Lancaster and the Halifax would emerge as capable four-engined strategic bombers , thousands of which would be built and operated by the RAF and several other services during the War . On 25 October 1939 , the Halifax performed its maiden flight , and it entered service with the RAF on 13 November 1940 . It quickly became a major component of Bomber Command , performing routine strategic bombing missions against the Axis Powers , many of them at night . Arthur Harris , the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Bomber Command , described the Halifax as inferior to the rival Lancaster , in part due to its inability to carry larger individual bombs such as the 4,000 pound Cookie blast bomb . Nevertheless , production of the Halifax continued until April 1945 . During their service with Bomber Command , Halifaxes flew a total of 82,773 operations and dropped 224,207 tons of bombs , while 1,833 aircraft were lost . The Halifax was also flown in large numbers by other Allied and Commonwealth nations , such as the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) , Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , Free French Air Force and Polish forces .",

The Vengeance was not used operationally by the United States , but was operated as a front-line aircraft by the British Royal Air Force , the Royal Australian Air Force , and the Indian Air Force in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific . The A-31 remained in service with U.S. units until 1945 , primarily in a target-tug role .",
  "/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire": "The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before , during , and after World War II . Many variants of the Spitfire were built , using several wing configurations , and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts ; nearly 60 remain airworthy , and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . The Spitfire was designed as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928 . Mitchell pushed the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing with cutting-edge sunken rivets ( designed by Beverley Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross-section , helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the Spitfire 's development through its multitude of variants . During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . However , Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire 's higher performance . During the battle , Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters - mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E-series aircraft , which were a close match for them . After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific , and South-East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo-reconnaissance , fighter-bomber , and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s .",

  "/wiki/Vickers_Wellington": "The Vickers Wellington is a British twin-engined , long-range medium bomber . It was designed during the mid-1930s at Brooklands in Weybridge , Surrey . Led by Vickers-Armstrongs ' chief designer Rex Pierson ; a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure , which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis . Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 , which was issued in the middle of 1932 . This specification called for a twin-engined day bomber capable of delivering higher performance than any previous design . Other aircraft developed to the same specification include the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Handley Page Hampden . During the development process , performance requirements such as for the tare weight changed substantially , and the engine used was not the one originally intended . The Wellington was used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War , performing as one of the principal bombers used by Bomber Command . During 1943 , it started to be superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined heavies such as the Avro Lancaster . The Wellington continued to serve throughout the war in other duties , particularly as an anti-submarine aircraft . It holds the distinction of having been the only British bomber that was produced for the duration of the war , and of having been produced in a greater quantity than any other British-built bomber . The Wellington remained as first-line equipment when the war ended , although it had been increasingly relegated to secondary roles .",

  "/wiki/Avro_Lancaster": "The Avro Lancaster is a British Second World War heavy bomber . It was designed and manufactured by Avro as a contemporary of the Handley Page Halifax , both bombers having been developed to the same specification , as well as the Short Stirling , all three aircraft being four-engined heavy bombers adopted by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the same wartime era . The Lancaster has its origins in the twin-engine Avro Manchester which had been developed during the late 1930s in response to the Air Ministry Specification P.13/36 for a capable medium bomber for world-wide use . Originally developed as an evolution of the Manchester ( which had proved troublesome in service and was retired in 1942 ) , the Lancaster was designed by Roy Chadwick and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins and in one version , Bristol Hercules engines . It first saw service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum , it was the main aircraft for the night-time bombing campaigns that followed . As increasing numbers of the type were produced , it became the principal heavy bomber used by the RAF , the RCAF and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF , overshadowing the Halifax and Stirling . A long , unobstructed bomb bay meant that the Lancaster could take the largest bombs used by the RAF , including the 4,000 lb ( 1,800 kg ) , 8,000 lb ( 3,600 kg ) and 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) blockbusters , loads often supplemented with smaller bombs or incendiaries . The Lanc , as it was known colloquially , became one of the most heavily used of the Second World War night bombers , delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties . The versatility of the Lancaster was such that it was chosen to equip 617 Squadron and was modified to carry the Upkeep Bouncing bomb designed by Barnes Wallis for Operation Chastise , the attack on German Ruhr valley dams . Although the Lancaster was primarily a night bomber , it excelled in many other roles , including daylight precision bombing , for which some Lancasters were adapted to carry the 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) Tallboy and then the 22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) Grand Slam earthquake bombs ( also designed by Wallis ) . This was the largest payload of any bomber in the war . In 1943 , a Lancaster was converted to become an engine test bed for the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 turbojet .",
  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito": "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined , shoulder-winged multirole combat aircraft , introduced during the Second World War . Unusual in that its frame is constructed mostly of wood , it was nicknamed the Wooden Wonder , or Mossie . Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , nicknamed it Freeman 's Folly , alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman , who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project . In 1941 , it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world . Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber , the Mosquito 's use evolved during the war into many roles , including low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber , high-altitude night bomber , pathfinder , day or night fighter , fighter-bomber , intruder , maritime strike , and photo-reconnaissance aircraft . It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a fast transport to carry small , high-value cargo to and from neutral countries through enemy-controlled airspace . The crew of two , pilot and navigator , sat side by side . A single passenger could ride in the aircraft 's bomb bay when necessary . The Mosquito FBVI was often flown in special raids , such as Operation Jericho - an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944 , and precision attacks against military intelligence , security , and police facilities ( such as Gestapo headquarters ) . On 30 January 1943 , the 10th anniversary of the Nazis ' seizure of power , a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann G\u00f6ring was speaking , putting his speech off the air . The Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and other air forces in the European , Mediterranean and Italian theatres . The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the Southeast Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War ."
