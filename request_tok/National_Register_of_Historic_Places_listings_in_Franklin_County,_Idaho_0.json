  "/wiki/Bear_River_Massacre_Site": "Bear River Massacre Site , near Preston , Idaho , is the site of the Bear River Massacre , in which a village of Shoshone Native Americans were attacked by the California Volunteers on January 29 , 1863 . Estimates of Shoshone casualties are as high as 384 . It is also known as Bear River Battleground or Massacre at Boa Ogoi . The incident has one of the highest recorded casualty counts of the American Indian Wars of the 19th century , but was overshadowed at the time by events of the ongoing American Civil War . The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990 . The battle site is located several miles northwest of Preston , and is roughly bisected by U.S. Route 91 . Its major topographical features are Bear River and the meadows that line its banks , Battle Creek ( then known as Beaver Creek ) , which runs north-south through the area , and has been partially channeled by US 91 . North of this channeled area the creek emerges from an escarpment running generally southwest-northeast . The Shoshone village was located on the meadows below this escarpment , and consisted of about 70 lodges on either side of Battle Creek , which cuts a ravine through the meadows on its way to the river . This ravine was one of the major killing fields , as defending Shoshone warriors used it as a natural defensive feature , and unarmed Natives sought refuge there from the battle . Natives fleeing the battle were also shot trying to swim across Bear River . The California Volunteers retrieved their dead , but left the Shoshones where they lay .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_91": "U.S. Route 91 or U.S. Highway 91 ( US-91 ) is a 172.663-mile-long ( 277.874 km ) north-south United States highway running from Brigham City , Utah to Idaho Falls , Idaho in the U.S. states of Idaho and Utah . Despite the 1 as the last digit in the number , US-91 is no longer a cross country artery . The highway currently serves to connect the communities of the Cache Valley to Interstate 15 and beyond . Prior to the mid-1970s , US 91 was an international commerce route from Long Beach , California to the Canada-US border north of Sweetgrass , Montana . US 91 was routed on the main streets of most of the communities it served , including Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas and State Street in Salt Lake City . From Los Angeles to Salt Lake , the route was built along the corridor of the Arrowhead Trail . US 91 has been largely replaced by Interstate 15 . A portion of the highway 's former route in California is currently State Route 91 .",
