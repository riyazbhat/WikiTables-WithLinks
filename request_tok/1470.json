Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair .

The design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between West Germany and France , and later joined by Italy , but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the Bundeswehr , with full-scale production starting in 1965 . In total , 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built , of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants , not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles . The Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces , and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide , with West Germany , Italy and the Netherlands being the largest operators until their retirement . Since 1990 , the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies . In the German Army , the Leopard 1 was completely phased out in 2003 by the Leopard 2 , while Leopard 1-based vehicles are still widely used in utility roles .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members .

  "/wiki/AMX_30": "The AMX-30 is a main battle tank designed by Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux ( AMX , then GIAT ) and first delivered to the French Army in 1966 . The first five tanks were issued to the 501st R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat ( Tank Regiment ) in August of that year . The production version of the AMX-30 weighed 36 metric tons ( 40 short tons ) , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility . The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats , thereby reducing the tank 's maneuverability . Protection , instead , was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle , including a height of 2.28 metres . It had a 105 mm gun , firing a then advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell , separated from the main charge by ball bearings , to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside . Mobility was provided by the 720 horsepower ( 540 kW ) HS-110 diesel engine , although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank 's performance . In 1979 , due to issues caused by the transmission , the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards , which included a new transmission , an improved engine and the introduction of a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator . Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants , including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle , the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system , a bridge-layer , the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher . It was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs . The first , the ARL 44 , was an interim tank .

  "/wiki/M-95_Degman": "The M-95 Degman is a prototype Croatian main battle tank , developed by the \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 company . It is a modernization of the Yugoslav M-84 tank , which is , in turn , a variant of the Soviet T-72 . The \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 factory is best known for its principal role in the production of M-84 in the Yugoslav era . The principal improvement over its predecessor M-84 is the application of spaced composite/laminate armor on top of which explosive reactive armor was added , hull front and side skirts are covered giving that extra protection against HEAT shaped-charge munitions . A separate ammunition bustle compartment at the back of the turret adds protection for the crew if tank is hit from behind , and added protection is given by additional slat armor in form of wire mesh with chains , main purpose being to prevent any rocket propelled grenades that might be used to penetrate weakest points at the back of the tank . \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 thermal imaging allows enhanced night activity and optional 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) engine , which increases the power-to-weight ratio to approximately 27 hp/t . There are numerous smaller changes in fire control , communications equipment , track etc . The Degman 's autoloader is 15 % faster meaning 9 shells can be fired in a single minute instead of 8 shells , which is M84 norm . The Degman M-95 has not entered serial production yet , however two prototypes were ordered by the Croatian Government , a M-95 model and the other M-84D sample ( for export ) . \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 is going to be producing the export version the M-84D ( essentially an M-84A4 with significant upgrades ) for Kuwait and other potential buyers . The Kuwaiti Army has confirmed interest in modernizing its 149 dated M-84 to the new M-84D standard , as well as the procurement of an additional 66 new M-84D 's .",

It borders Slovenia to the northwest , Hungary to the northeast , Serbia to the east , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and Montenegro to the southeast , sharing a maritime border with Italy . Its capital , Zagreb , forms one of the country 's primary subdivisions , along with twenty counties . Croatia has an area of 56,594 square kilometres ( 21,851 square miles ) and a population of 4.28 million , most of whom are Roman Catholics . Croatia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Age . The Croats arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century . Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke Branimir . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom , which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries . During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended , Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne . In October 1918 , in the final days of World War I , the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , independent from Austria-Hungary , was proclaimed in Zagreb , and in December 1918 it was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ) . Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , most of the Croatian territory was incorporated into a Nazi-backed client-state , the Independent State of Croatia ."
