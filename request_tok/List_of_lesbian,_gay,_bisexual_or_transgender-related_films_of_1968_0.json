Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career .

On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) .

Born in Mogliano , in the province of Macerata , Girotti developed his athletic physique by swimming and playing polo . While studying engineering , he attracted the attention of Mario Soldati , who offered him a small part in the film Dora Nelson ( 1939 ) , but it was not until later , in Alessandro Blasetti 's La corona di ferro ( The Iron Crown ) ( 1941 ) and Roberto Rossellini 's Un Pilota ritorna ( A Pilot Returns ) ( 1942 ) , that he began to make an impression as a serious actor . In 1943 came a turning point in his career when Luchino Visconti cast him opposite the torrid Clara Calamai in Ossessione ( Obsession ) , an earlier adaptation of the same novel on which Hollywood 's The Postman Always Rings Twice is based . The film marked , in a sense , the birth of Italian neo-realism . Some of his notable post-war films include Caccia tragica ( The Tragic Hunt ) ( 1946 ) by Giuseppe De Santis and In nome della legge ( 1949 ) ( In the Name of the Law ) by Pietro Germi . In 1950 , he starred opposite Lucia Bos\u00e9 in Michelangelo Antonioni 's first full-length feature , Cronaca di un amore ( Story of a Love Affair ) ( 1950 ) . In 1953 , he played Spartacus in an Italian epic film known in the US as Sins of Rome and then , returned to work again for Visconti , in Senso ( 1954 ) , giving perhaps the finest performance of his career . In the years which followed , he appeared in many mainly Italian films for directors such as Lizzani , Bolognini , Vittorio Cottafavi , Lattuada , but it was not until 1968 that he once again played a role worthy of his talents - that of the father in Pasolini 's Teorema ( Theorem ) with Terence Stamp and Silvana Mangano .
