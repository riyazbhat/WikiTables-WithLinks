  "/wiki/Guqin": "The guqin ( [ ku\u0300t\u0255\u02b0i\u030cn ] ( listen ) ; Chinese : \u53e4\u7434 ) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family . It has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement , as highlighted by the quote a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason , as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius . It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as the father of Chinese music or the instrument of the sages . The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng , another Chinese long zither also without frets , but with moveable bridges under each string . Traditionally , the instrument was simply referred to as the qin ( \u7434 ) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well : the yangqin hammered dulcimer , the huqin family of bowed string instruments , and the Western piano are examples of this usage . The prefix gu- ( \u53e4 ; meaning ancient ) was later added for clarification . Thus , the instrument is called guqin today . It can also be called qixian-qin ( \u4e03\u7d43\u7434 ; lit . seven-stringed zither ) . Because Robert Hans van Gulik 's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute , the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute . Other incorrect classifications , mainly from music compact discs , include harp or table-harp . The guqin is a very quiet instrument , with a range of about four octaves , and its open strings are tuned in the bass register",

Japanese society during this period was predominately agricultural and centered around village life . Most of the villagers followed a religion based on the worship of natural and ancestral spirits named kami which is Shintoism The capital at Nara was modeled after Chang'an , the capital city of the Tang dynasty . In many other ways , the Japanese upper classes patterned themselves after the Chinese , including adopting the Chinese writing system , Chinese fashion , and a Chinese version of Buddhism",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system . Besides political hegemony , the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea",

It was introduced to North America in 1844 from Europe and Asia where it was originally sought after as an exotic ornamental tree . Its fruits ( botanically capsules ) were also used as packaging material for goods shipped from East Asia to North America , leading to Paulownia groves where they were dumped near major ports . The tree has not persisted prominently in US gardens , in part due to its overwintering brown fruits that some consider ugly . In some areas it has escaped cultivation and is found in disturbed plots . Some US authorities consider the genus an invasive species , but in Europe , where it is also grown in gardens , it is not regarded as invasive",

Originally a small fishing village named Edo ( \u6c5f\u6238 ) , the city became a prominent political center of Japan when Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603 . When Emperor Meiji moved the imperial seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868 , Edo was renamed Tokyo , literally the Eastern Capital . The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e9c , T\u014dky\u014d-fu ) and the city of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) .

Modern Tokyo is categorized as an alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . As of 2019 , the population of Tokyo was estimated to be over 13.9 million , making it Japan 's most populous prefecture . The metropolitan area is the world 's most populous with over 40 million people as well as the world 's largest urban agglomeration economy .

  "/wiki/Maki-e": "Maki-e ( \u8494\u7d75 , literally : sprinkled picture ) is Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a makizutsu or a kebo brush . The oldest Maki-e in existence now is the ornamentation on the sheath of the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay in Togidashi technique held by Sh\u014ds\u014din in Nara , Japan . Originally the sword was treasured by the Emperor Sh\u014dmu ( 701 - June 4 , 756 ) The technique was developed mainly in the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) and blossomed in the Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles ; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power . To create different colours and textures , maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold , silver , copper , brass , lead , aluminum , platinum , and pewter , as well as their alloys . Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines . As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting , young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters . K\u014dami D\u014dch\u014d ( 1410-1478 ) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works . His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters . K\u014dami and another maki-e master , Igarashi Shinsai , were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan . Takamakie ( or raised maki-e ) is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making . Developed in the Muromachi period ( 1336-1573 ) , the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder , lacquer , and charcoal or clay dust",

  "/wiki/Dowry": "A dowry is a transfer of parental property , gifts , or money at the marriage of a daughter ( bride ) . Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of bride price and dower . While bride price or bride service is a payment by the groom side or his family to the bride 's parents , dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride 's family to the groom or his family , ostensibly for the bride . Similarly , dower is the property settled on the bride herself , by the groom at the time of marriage , and which remains under her ownership and control . Dowry is an ancient custom , and its existence may well predate records of it . Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world , mainly in parts of Asia , Northern Africa and the Balkans . In some parts of the world , disputes related to dowry sometimes result in acts of violence against women , including killings and acid attacks . The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly patrilineal and that expect women to reside with or near their husband 's family ( patrilocality ) . Dowries have long histories in Europe , South Asia , Africa and other parts of the world",
