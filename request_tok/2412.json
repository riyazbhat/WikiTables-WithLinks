  "/wiki/The_Rules_of_the_Game": "The Rules of the Game ( original French title : La R\u00e8gle du Jeu ) is a 1939 French comedy-drama satirical film directed by Jean Renoir . It features an ensemble cast of Nora Gregor , Paulette Dubost , Mila Par\u00e9ly , Marcel Dalio , Julien Carette , Roland Toutain , Gaston Modot , Pierre Magnier and Jean Renoir himself . Renoir 's portrayal of the wise , mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this pensive comedy of manners . The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just before the beginning of World War II , showing their moral callousness on the eve of impending destruction . The Rules of the Game was the most expensive French film up to that time , with its original budget of 2.5 million francs increased to over five million . When directing the film , Renoir and cinematographer Jean Bachelet made use of deep-focus cinematography and long shots during which the camera is constantly moving , both sophisticated cinematic techniques in 1939 . Renoir 's career in France was at its pinnacle in 1939 , and The Rules of the Game was eagerly anticipated ; however , its premiere was met with scorn and disapproval by both critics and audiences . Renoir reduced the film 's running time from 113 minutes to 85 , but even then the film was a critical and financial disaster . In October 1939 , it was banned by the wartime French government for having an undesirable influence over the young . For many years , the 85-minute version was the only one available , but despite this its reputation slowly grew . In 1956 , boxes of original material were rediscovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival , with only a minor scene from Renoir 's first cut missing . Since then , The Rules of the Game has often been called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema ."
