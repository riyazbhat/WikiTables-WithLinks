It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent",
  "/wiki/Calvinism": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others",

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people",

The group reports a worldwide membership of approximately 8.68 million adherents involved in evangelism and an annual Memorial attendance of over 20 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Warwick , New York , United States , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell , who also co-founded Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement 's publications . A leadership dispute after Russell 's death resulted in several groups breaking away , with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties . Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes , including adoption of the name Jehovah 's witnesses [ note 1 ] in 1931 to distinguish them from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions . Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and for refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider the use of God 's name vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines .
