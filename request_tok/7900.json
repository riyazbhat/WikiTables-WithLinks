Written and directed by Chris Weitz , it stars Nicole Kidman , Dakota Blue Richards , Daniel Craig , Sam Elliott , Eva Green , and Ian McKellen . The project was announced in February 2002 , but difficulties over the script and the selection of a director caused significant delays . At US $ 180 million , it was one of New Line Cinema 's most expensive projects ever , and its disappointing results in the US contributed to New Line 's February 2008 restructuring . The film depicts the adventures of Lyra Belacqua , an orphan living in a parallel universe where a dogmatic ruling power called the Magisterium opposes free inquiry . Children in that universe are being kidnapped by an unknown group called the Gobblers who are supported by the Magisterium . Lyra joins a tribe of seafarers on a trip to the far North , the land of the armoured polar bears , in search of the missing children . Before its release , the film received criticism from secularist organisations and fans of the His Dark Materials trilogy for the dilution of elements of the story which were critical of religion , as well as from some religious organisations for the source material 's anti-religious themes . The studio ordered significant changes late in post-production , which Weitz later called a terrible experience . Although the film 's visual effects ( which Weitz has called the film 's most successful element ) won both a BAFTA and an Academy Award , critical reception was mixed and revenue lower than anticipated .",
