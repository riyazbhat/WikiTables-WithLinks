He organized efforts to make water flows from the Hjellevannet on the lower water basin in the Skien watercourse ( Skiensvassdraget ) to the Skien River ( Skienselva ) so that water could drive recovery saws . He established sawmills and the timber trade rose sharply in Skien . He was cited as mayor of Skien in 1568 , 1570 and 1578 . His considerable fortune was largely derived from the number of properties he owned in the city and district . These properties were divided between his five daughters whose descendants dominated the commercial life in Skien into the 17th century as timber merchants and estate owners . Among his descendants were Anne Clausdatter ( 1659-1713 ) who owned Borgestad Manor and Christian Cornelius Paus ( 1800-1879 ) who was Governor of Bratsberg ."
