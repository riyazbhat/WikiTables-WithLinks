  "/wiki/Barrow_in_Furness": "Barrow-in-Furness is a town in Cumbria , North-West England . Historically part of Lancashire , it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness . At the tip of the Furness peninsula , close to the Lake District , it is bordered by Morecambe Bay , the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea . In 2011 , Barrow 's population was 57,000 , making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle , although it is geographically closer to the whole of Lancashire and most of Merseyside . Natives of Barrow , as well as the local dialect , are known as Barrovian . In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer . Several Royal Navy flagships , the vast majority of its nuclear submarines as well as numerous other naval vessels , ocean liners and oil tankers have been manufactured at the facility .",

The north-east of Worcestershire includes part of the industrial West Midlands ; the rest of the county is largely rural . The county is divided into six administrative districts : Worcester , Redditch , Wychavon , Malvern Hills , Wyre Forest , and Bromsgrove . The area that is now Worcestershire was absorbed into the unified Kingdom of England in 927 , at which time it was constituted as a county ( see History of Worcestershire ) . Over the centuries the county borders have been modified , but it was not until 1844 that substantial changes were made . This culminated with the abolition of Worcestershire in 1974 with its northern area becoming part of the West Midlands and the rest part of the county of Hereford and Worcester .
