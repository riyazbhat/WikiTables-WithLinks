  "/wiki/Toll_road": "A toll road , also known as a turnpike or tollway , is a public or private road ( almost always a controlled-access highway in the present day ) for which a fee ( or toll ) is assessed for passage . It is a form of road pricing typically implemented to help recoup the cost of road construction and maintenance . Toll roads have existed in some form since antiquity , with tolls levied on passing travellers on foot , wagon , or horseback ; but their prominence increased with the rise of the automobile , [ citation needed ] and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively . The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type , weight , or number of axles , with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars . Tolls are often collected at toll plazas , toll booths , toll houses , stations , bars , or gates . Some toll collection points are autonomous , and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid . To cut costs and minimise time delay , many tolls are collected with electronic toll collection equipment which automatically communicates with a toll payer 's transponder or uses automatic number plate recognition to charge drivers by debiting their accounts . Criticisms of toll roads include the time taken to stop and pay the toll , and the cost of the toll booth operators - up to about one-third of revenue in some cases . Automated toll-paying systems help minimise both of these . Others object to paying twice for the same road : in fuel taxes and with tolls . In addition to toll roads , toll bridges and toll tunnels are also used by public authorities to generate funds to repay the cost of building the structures . Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure , or are applied as a general fund by local governments , not being earmarked for transport facilities",

  "/wiki/Underground_Railroad": "The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early to mid-19th century , and used by enslaved African-Americans to escape into free states and Canada . The scheme was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees . Not literally a railroad , the workers ( both black and white , free and enslaved ) who secretly aided the fugitives are also collectively referred to as the Underground Railroad . Various other routes led to Mexico , where slavery had been abolished , or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763-83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 . One of the main reasons Florida was purchased by the United States was to end its function as a safe haven for escaped slaves . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s . It ran north and grew steadily until the Civil War began . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Railroad . British North America ( present-day Canada ) was a desirable destination , as its long border gave many points of access , it was further from slave catchers , and beyond the reach of the United States ' Fugitive Slave Acts . Most former slaves , reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , settled in Ontario . More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period , although U.S. Census figures account for only 6,000",

  "/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church": "The Methodist Episcopal Church ( MEC ) was the oldest and largest Methodist denomination in the United States from its founding in 1784 until 1939 . It was also the first religious denomination in the US to organize itself on a national basis . In 1939 , the MEC reunited with two breakaway Methodist denominations ( the Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church , South ) to form the Methodist Church . In 1968 , the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church . The MEC 's origins lie in the First Great Awakening when Methodism emerged as an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England that stressed the necessity of being born again and the possibility of attaining Christian perfection . By the 1760s , Methodism had spread to the Thirteen Colonies , and Methodist societies were formed under the oversight of John Wesley . As in England , American Methodists remained affiliated with the Church of England , but this state of affairs became untenable after the American Revolution . In response , Wesley ordained the first Methodist elders for America in 1784 . Under the leadership of its first bishops , Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury , the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted episcopal polity and an itinerant model of ministry that saw circuit riders provide for the religious needs of a widespread and mobile population . Early Methodism was countercultural in that it was anti-elitist and anti-slavery , appealing especially to African Americans and women . While critics derided Methodists as fanatics , the Methodist Episcopal Church continued to grow , especially during the Second Great Awakening in which Methodist revivalism and camp meetings left its imprint on American culture . In the early 19th century , the MEC became the largest and most influential religious denomination in the United States",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Plattsburgh": "The Battle of Plattsburgh , also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain , ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812 . A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Pr\u00e9vost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh , which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army , all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb , and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough . Downie 's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814 , but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed . Pr\u00e9vost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb 's defences and retreated to Canada , stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured , any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake . When the battle took place , American and British delegates were meeting at Ghent in the Kingdom of the Netherlands , attempting to negotiate a treaty acceptable to both sides to end the war . The American victory at Plattsburgh , and the successful defense at the Battle of Baltimore , which began the next day and halted British advances in the Mid-Atlantic states , denied the British negotiators leverage to demand any territorial claims against the United States on the basis of Uti possidetis , i.e . retaining territory they held at the end of hostilities . The Treaty of Ghent , in which captured or occupied territories were restored on the basis of Status quo ante bellum , was signed three months after the battle"
