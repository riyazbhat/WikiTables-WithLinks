  "/wiki/Autonomy_(software)": "HP Autonomy , previously Autonomy Corporation PLC , is a multinational enterprise software company founded in Cambridge , United Kingdom in 1996 . Originally , Autonomy specialised in analysis of large scale unstructured big data , becoming the UK 's largest and most successful software business by 2010 . It used a combination of technologies born out of research at the University of Cambridge and developed a variety of enterprise search and knowledge management applications using adaptive pattern recognition techniques centered on Bayesian inference in conjunction with traditional methods . It maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach , and controls described as a rod of iron , which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest 5% of its sales force each quarter , while cosseting the best sales staff like rock stars . Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) in October 2011 . The deal valued Autonomy at $ 11.7 billion ( \u00a37.4 billion ) with a premium of around 79% over market price that was widely criticized as absurdly high , a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings by expanding the high-margin software services sector . Within a year , major culture clashes became apparent and HP had written off $ 8.8 billion of Autonomy 's value . HP claims this resulted from accounting improprieties , misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management . A successful fraud case was brought against the CFO Sushovan Hussain . Previous management in turn accused HP of a textbook example of defensive stalling :6 to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company , noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues:3 and that even HP 's CFO disagreed with the price paid . :3-6 External observers generally state that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements , and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously . HP recruited Robert Youngjohns , ex-Microsoft president of North America , to take over HP Autonomy in September 2012 , who has worked towards a turnaround through expanding its information management and analytics software business .",

Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",

New features of Windows Vista include an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero , a new search component called Windows Search , redesigned networking , audio , print and display sub-systems , and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker . Vista aimed to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network , using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices . Windows Vista included version 3.0 of the .NET Framework , allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs . Microsoft 's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system . One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors was their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware , viruses and buffer overflows . In light of this , Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide Trustworthy Computing initiative , which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company . Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista , thus delaying its completion . While these new features and security improvements garnered positive reviews , Vista was also the target of much criticism and negative press .",

  "/wiki/Windows_XP": "Windows XP is a personal computer operating system produced by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems . It was released to manufacturing on August 24 , 2001 , and broadly released for retail sale on October 25 , 2001 . Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as Neptune , an operating system ( OS ) built on the Windows NT kernel which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer use . An updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market ; however , in January 2000 , both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed Whistler , which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets . As such , Windows XP was the first consumer edition of Windows not to be based on MS-DOS . Upon its release , Windows XP received critical acclaim , with critics noting increased performance and stability ( especially in comparison to Windows Me , the previous version of Windows aimed at home users ) , a more intuitive user interface , improved hardware support , and expanded multimedia capabilities . However , some industry reviewers were concerned by the new licensing model and product activation system . Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8 , 2014 , after which the operating system ceased receiving further support or security updates ( with exceptional security updates being made e.g . in 2019 , to address potential ransomware threats ) to most users . By August 2019 , Microsoft ( and others ) had ended support for games on Windows XP . As of February 2020 [ update ] , 1.25% of Windows PCs run Windows XP , and a little under 1% of all traditional PCs run Windows XP . At least one country has double digit use : Armenia , where it is highest ranked at 40.76% as of January 2020 ; use in China is also exceptionally high at 3.94% as of January 2020 .",
