  "/wiki/Islay": "Islay ( /\u02c8a\u026al\u0259/ ( listen ) EYE-l\u0259 ; Scottish Gaelic : \u00ccle ) is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . Known as The Queen of the Hebrides , it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of the Northern Irish coast . The island 's capital is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located . Port Ellen is the main port . Islay is the fifth-largest Scottish island and the eighth-largest island of the British Isles , with a total area of almost 620 square kilometres ( 239 sq mi ) . [ Note 1 ] There is ample evidence of the prehistoric settlement of Islay and the first written reference may have come in the 1st century AD . The island had become part of the Gaelic Kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata during the Early Middle Ages before being absorbed into the Norse Kingdom of the Isles . The later medieval period marked a cultural high point with the transfer of the Hebrides to the Kingdom of Scotland and the emergence of the Clan Donald Lordship of the Isles , originally centred at Finlaggan . During the 17th century the Clan Donald star waned , but improvements to agriculture and transport led to a rising population , which peaked in the mid-19th century . This was followed by substantial forced displacements and declining resident numbers . Today , it has over 3,000 inhabitants and the main commercial activities are agriculture , malt whisky distillation and tourism . The island has a long history of religious observance and Scottish Gaelic is spoken by about a quarter of the population",
  "/wiki/Aller\u00f8d_Oscillation": "The Aller\u00f8d oscillation ( Danish : Aller\u00f8dtiden ) was a warm and moist global interstadial that occurred c.13,900 to 12,900 BP , nearly at the end of the last glacial period . It raised temperatures in the northern Atlantic region to almost present-day levels , before they declined again in the succeeding glacial Younger Dryas , which was followed by the present warm Holocene . In some regions , especially in northern Eurasia , there is evidence for a cold period known as the Older Dryas interrupting the interstadial . In such regions the shorter oscillation ending with the Older Dryas is known as the B\u00f8lling oscillation , and the Aller\u00f8d period is the interstadial following the Older Dryas . The Aller\u00f8d period was named after a type site in Fures\u00f8 municipality in Sj\u00e6lland , Denmark ( near Copenhagen ) , where deposits created during the period were first identified in work published in 1901 by Hartz and Milthers . This Blytt-Sernander period corresponds to Pollen zone II",
  "/wiki/Younger_Dryas": "The Younger Dryas ( around 12,800 to 11,550 years BP ) was a return to glacial conditions after the Late Glacial Interstadial , which temporarily reversed the gradual climatic warming after the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) started receding around 20,000 BP . It is named after an indicator genus , the alpine-tundra wildflower Dryas octopetala , as its leaves are occasionally abundant in late glacial , often minerogenic-rich sediments , such as the lake sediments of Scandinavia . Physical evidence of a sharp decline in temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere has been discovered by geological research . This temperature change occurred at the end of what the earth sciences refer to as the Pleistocene epoch and immediately before the current , warmer Holocene epoch . In archaeology , this time frame coincides with the final stages of the Upper Paleolithic in many areas . The Younger Dryas was the most recent and longest of several interruptions to the gradual warming of the Earth 's climate since the severe LGM , about 27,000 to 24,000 years BP . The change was relatively sudden , taking place in decades , and it resulted in a decline of 2 to 6\u00b0C ( 3.6 to 10.8\u00b0F ) and advances of glaciers and drier conditions , over much of the temperate Northern Hemisphere . It is thought to have been caused by a decline in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation , which transports warm water from the Equator towards the North Pole , in turn thought to have been caused by an influx of fresh , cold water from North America to the Atlantic . The Younger Dryas was a period of climatic change , but the effects were complex and variable . In the Southern Hemisphere and some areas of the Northern Hemisphere , such as southeastern North America , a slight warming occurred",

The Cramond area has a long history , with evidence of Mesolithic , Bronze Age and Roman activity . In modern times , it was the birthplace of the Scottish economist John Law ( 1671-1729 ) . Cramond was incorporated into the City of Edinburgh by the Edinburgh Boundaries Extension and Tramways Act 1920",
  "/wiki/South_Queensferry": "Queensferry , also called South Queensferry or simply The Ferry , is a town to the west of Edinburgh , Scotland , traditionally a royal burgh of West Lothian . It lies ten miles to the north-west of Edinburgh city centre , on the shore of the Firth of Forth between the Forth Bridge , Forth Road Bridge and the Queensferry Crossing . The prefix South serves to distinguish it from North Queensferry , on the opposite shore of the Forth . Both towns derive their name from the ferry service established by Queen Margaret in the 11th century , which continued to operate at the town until 1964 , when the Road Bridge was opened . Its population at the 2011 census was 9,026 based on the 2010 definition of the locality which in addition to the burgh includes Dalmeny",
  "/wiki/Aberdeenshire": "Aberdeenshire ( Scots : Aiberdeenshire ; Scottish Gaelic : Siorrachd Obar Dheathain ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland . It takes its name from the County of Aberdeen which has substantially different boundaries . The Aberdeenshire council area includes all of the area of the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire ( except the area making up the City of Aberdeen ) , as well as part of Banffshire . The county boundaries are officially used for a few purposes , namely land registration and lieutenancy . Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House , in Aberdeen , making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction . Aberdeen itself forms a different council area ( Aberdeen City ) . Aberdeenshire borders onto Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south , Highland and Moray to the west and Aberdeen City to the east . Traditionally , it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector ( agriculture , fishing , and forestry ) and related processing industries . Over the last 40 years , the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire 's economic base , and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50 % since 1975 . Its land represents 8 % of Scotland 's overall territory . It covers an area of 6,313 square kilometres ( 2,437 sq mi )",
  "/wiki/Warren_Field": "Warren Field is the location of a mesolithic calendar monument built about 8,000 BCE . It includes 12 pits believed to correlate with phases of the Moon and used as a lunar calendar . It is considered to be the oldest lunar calendar yet found . It is near Crathes Castle , in the Aberdeenshire region of Scotland , in the United Kingdom . It was originally discovered from the air as anomalous terrain by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland . It was first excavated in 2004 . The pits align on the south east horizon and a prominent topographic point associated with sunrise on the midwinter solstice ( thus providing an annual astronomical correction concerning the passage of time as indicated by the Moon , the asynchronous solar year and the associated seasons ) . The Aberdeenshire time reckoner predates the Mesopotamian calendars by nearly 5,000 years . It was also interpreted as a seasonal calendar because the local prehistoric communities , which relied on hunting migrating animals needed to carefully note the seasons to be prepared for a particular food source . The Warren Field site is particularly significant for its very early date and the fact that it was created by Hunter-gatherer peoples , rather than sedentary farmers usually associated with monument building",
  "/wiki/R\u00f9m": "R\u00f9m ( /r\u028cm/ ( listen ) ; Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : [ r\u02e0u\u02d0m ] ) , a Scottish Gaelic name often anglicised to Rum , is one of the Small Isles of the Inner Hebrides , in the district of Lochaber , Scotland . For much of the 20th century the name became Rhum , a spelling invented by the former owner , Sir George Bullough , because he did not relish the idea of having the title Laird of Rum . It is the largest of the Small Isles , and the 15th largest Scottish island , but is inhabited by only about thirty or so people , all of whom live in the hamlet of Kinloch on the east coast . The island has been inhabited since the 8th millennium BC and provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland . The early Celtic and Norse settlers left only a few written accounts and artefacts . From the 12th to 13th centuries on , the island was held by various clans including the MacLeans of Coll . The population grew to over 400 by the late 18th century but was cleared of its indigenous population between 1826 and 1828 . The island then became a sporting estate , the exotic Kinloch Castle being constructed by the Bulloughs in 1900 . R\u00f9m was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1957 . R\u00f9m is mainly igneous in origin , and its mountains have been eroded by Pleistocene glaciation . It is now an important study site for research in ecology , especially of red deer , and is the site of a successful reintroduction programme for the white-tailed sea eagle . Its economy is entirely dependent on Scottish Natural Heritage , a public body that now manages the island , and there have been calls for a greater diversity of housing provision",
  "/wiki/Corylus_avellana": "Corylus avellana , the common hazel , is a species of hazel native to Europe and western Asia , from the British Isles south to Iberia , Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , north to central Scandinavia , and east to the central Ural Mountains , the Caucasus , and northwestern Iran . It is an important component of the hedgerows that were the traditional field boundaries in lowland England . The wood was traditionally grown as coppice , the poles cut being used for wattle-and-daub building and agricultural fencing . Common hazel is cultivated for its nuts . The name hazelnut applies to the nuts of any of the species of the genus Corylus , but in commercial settings a hazelnut is usually that of C. avellana . This hazelnut or cob nut , the kernel of the seed , is edible and used raw or roasted , or ground into a paste . The cob is round , compared with the longer filbert nut",
  "/wiki/Charcoal": "Charcoal is a lightweight black carbon residue produced by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and plant materials . Charcoal is usually produced by slow pyrolysis - the heating of wood or other organic materials in the absence of oxygen . This process is called charcoal burning . The finished charcoal consists largely of carbon . The advantage of burning charcoal compared to burning wood is the absence of water and other components . This allows charcoal to burn at higher temperatures , and give off very little smoke ( regular wood can release a significant amount of steam , organic volatiles , and unburnt carbon particles - soot - in its smoke , when it is not burned completely )",
  "/wiki/Applecross": "Applecross is a peninsula in the council area of Highland , Scotland . The name Applecross is at least 1300 years old and is not used locally to refer to the 19th century village ( which is correctly called 'Shore Street ' , or simply 'The Street ' ) with the Applecross Inn , lying on the small Applecross Bay , facing the Inner Sound , on the opposite side of which lies the Inner Hebridean island of Raasay . The monastery of Applecross was established by St Maelrubha , in the 7th century . A sculptured stone is the only relic of Maelrubha remaining , who built a chapel there .

  "/wiki/Midden": "A midden ( also kitchen midden or shell heap ) is an old dump for domestic waste which may consist of animal bone , human excrement , botanical material , mollusc shells , sherds , lithics ( especially debitage ) , and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with past human occupation . These features , therefore , provide a useful resource for archaeologists who wish to study the diets and habits of past societies . Middens with damp , anaerobic conditions can even preserve organic remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile . Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss . During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well . Different mechanisms , from wind and water to animal digs , create a matrix which can also be analysed to provide seasonal and climatic information . In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed",
  "/wiki/Sand,_Applecross": "Sand on the Applecross Peninsula in Wester Ross , Scotland , is an archaeological site . Sand is the site of a major archaeological excavation on the Inner Sound coast of the Applecross Peninsula in Western Scotland , to the north of the small town of Applecross . A small number of shell middens were known as rare traces of Mesolithic settlement when a rock shelter and shell midden at Sand , Applecross on the coast of Wester Ross , Scotland , was selected for detailed excavation as part of a study of shell middens in the area around the Inner Sound between the Skye and the mainland . The Scotlands First Settlers project ( SFS ) investigating the relationship of early inhabitants with the western seaboard chose this area which had known sites at An Corran in Staffin , Skye , and at Redpoint and Shieldaig in Torridon . Their surveys in 1999 and 2000 found 104 previously unknown sites , mostly caves and rock shelters with 21 lithic scatters and 9 open shell middens . A proportion of these sites will be more recent , but test pits at 4 sites found Loch a Sguirr on Raasay and Sand in Applecross to be Mesolithic . The indication is that there are many more surviving sites than had been expected . The rock shelter site at Sand on the Applecross peninsula , just to the north of Applecross itself , faces out across the Inner Sound westwards towards Skye and Raasay . Around 7,500 years BCE the first users of the rock shelter had worked antler and stone to make tools . As well as using local stone for their tools they had obtained distinctive stone from the island of R\u00f9m , 30 km ( 19 mi ) to the south , and Staffin on Skye , 10 km ( 6.2 mi ) to the west , showing that they were able to cross open sea . Gradually a large pile of shells , mainly limpets , built up into a large midden . Abundant fragments of stone pot-boilers and bevel ended bone tools indicate that the shellfish were being cooked and the contents scooped out",

  "/wiki/Skye": "The Isle of Skye , commonly known as Skye ( /ska\u026a/ ; Scottish Gaelic : An t-Eilean Sgitheanach or Eilean a ' Che\u00f2 ) , is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . [ Note 1 ] The island 's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillin , the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country . Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name 's origins . The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period , and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald . The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms , some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands . Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century . Skye 's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 . About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001 , and although their numbers are in decline , this aspect of island culture remains important . The main industries are tourism , agriculture , fishing and forestry . Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area . The island 's largest settlement is Portree , which is also its capital , known for its picturesque harbour .

Jura is part of the council area of Argyll and Bute . The island is mountainous , bare and infertile , covered largely by vast areas of blanket bog . The main settlement is the east coast village of Craighouse , which is its capital . Craighouse is home to the Jura distillery , producing Isle of Jura single malt whisky . The village is also home to the island 's only hotel , shop and church . Other settlements include Ardfernal , Ardmenish , Inverlussa , Keils , Kinuachdrachd , Knockrome , Lagg , Leargybreck and Tarbert . Between Jura 's northern tip and the island of Scarba lies the Gulf of Corryvreckan , where a whirlpool makes passage dangerous at certain states of the tide . The southern part of the island , from Loch Tarbert southwards , is designated a national scenic area ( NSA ) , one of 40 such areas in Scotland , which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and ensure their protection from inappropriate development . The Jura NSA covers 30,317 hectares in total , consisting of 21,072 ha of land , with a further 9245 ha being marine ( i.e . below low tide )",

'harbour wave ' , pronounced [ ts\u026fnami ] ) is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water , generally in an ocean or a large lake . Earthquakes , volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions ( including detonations , landslides , glacier calvings , meteorite impacts and other disturbances ) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami . Unlike normal ocean waves , which are generated by wind , or tides , which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun , a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water . Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer . Rather than appearing as a breaking wave , a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide . For this reason , it is often referred to as a tidal wave , although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis . Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves , with periods ranging from minutes to hours , arriving in a so-called wave train . Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events . Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas , their destructive power can be enormous , and they can affect entire ocean basins . The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history , with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean . The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian War that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes , but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown",
