The franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883 , replacing the team from Worcester , Massachusetts , in the National League .

The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history , most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a series-winning walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run . They also won the 1971 World Series , led by the talent of Roberto Clemente , and the 1979 World Series under the slogan We Are Family , led by Pops Willie Stargell . After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s ( winning three straight NL East Division titles ) , the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years , with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012 - the longest such streak in American professional sports history - before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94-68 , qualifying them for the NL Wild Card .

  "/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston , Massachusetts . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The team have won nine World Series championships , tied for the third-most of any MLB team , and they have played in 13 . Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018 . In addition , they won the 1904 American League pennant , but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series . Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports",
