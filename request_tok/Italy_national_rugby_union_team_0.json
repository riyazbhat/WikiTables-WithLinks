Nicknamed the Pumas ( Los Pumas in Spanish ) , they play in sky blue and white jerseys , Argentina played its first international rugby match in 1910 against a touring British Isles team . As of 23 September 2019 they are ranked 11th in the world by the IRB , making them the highest-ranked nation in the Americas . They have competed at every Rugby World Cup staged since the first tournament of 1987 , and the country are considered the strongest within the Americas , being undefeated against all but Canada , against whom they have suffered three losses . Although rugby union in Argentina is not as popular as association football , the Pumas ' impressive results since the 1999 World Cup have seen the sport 's popularity grow significantly . Argentina has achieved several upset victories , are tough contenders when playing in Buenos Aires , and are capable of regularly defeating Six Nations sides . A surprise victory over the hosts France in the first game of the 2007 World Cup took Argentina to fourth in the IRB World Rankings . The team were undefeated in their pool , and reached the semi-finals for the first time , beating Scotland 19-13 in their quarter-final . They were defeated 37-13 by eventual winners South Africa in the semi-finals , but followed this up with a second win over France to claim third place overall . By the end of the competition , the team had reached an all-time high of third in the World Rankings . After their advances in competitiveness and performance during the 2000s , coupled with their location in the Southern Hemisphere , Argentina was the only tier 1 nation that had no regular competition , and some , among them former Pumas captain Agust\u00edn Pichot , had even spoken of them joining the Six Nations . Argentina officially joined The Rugby Championship in a meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 November 2011 .",

The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",
