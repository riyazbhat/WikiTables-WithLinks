  "/wiki/The_Righteous_Brothers": "The Righteous Brothers were originally an American musical duo of Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield . They began performing together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours , but adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they embarked on their recording career as a duo . Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and 70s , and although the duo was inactive for some years , Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield 's death in 2003 . Their emotive vocal style is sometimes dubbed blue-eyed soul . Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges , which helped them to create a distinctive sound as a duet , but also strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists . Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice , with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his tenor voice . They had their first major hit with the 1964 song You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' , produced by Phil Spector and often considered one of his finest works . Other notable hits include Ebb Tide , Soul and Inspiration , Rock and Roll Heaven , and in particular , their version of Unchained Melody . Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers . In 2016 , Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo .",

  "/wiki/The_Doors": "The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965 , with vocalist Jim Morrison , keyboardist Ray Manzarek , guitarist Robby Krieger , and drummer John Densmore . They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s , mostly because of Morrison 's lyrics and his erratic stage persona , and the group was widely regarded as representative of the era 's counterculture . The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley 's book The Doors of Perception , itself a reference to a quote by William Blake . After signing with Elektra Records , the Doors released eight albums in five years , some of which are considered among the greatest of all time , including The Doors ( 1967 ) , Strange Days ( 1967 ) , and L.A. Woman ( 1971 ) . By 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles . Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971 . The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973 . They released three more albums in the 1970s , two of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison , and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations . In 2002 , Manzarek , Krieger and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as the Doors of the 21st Century . Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band 's name . After a short time as Riders on the Storm , they settled on the name Manzarek-Krieger and toured until Manzarek 's death in 2013 . The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs .",

  "/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone": "Sly and the Family Stone was an American band from San Francisco . Active from 1966 to 1983 , it was pivotal in the development of funk , soul , rock , and psychedelic music . Its core line-up was led by singer-songwriter , producer , and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone , and included Stone 's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone , sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone , trumpeter Cynthia Robinson , drummer Greg Errico , saxophonist Jerry Martini , and bassist Larry Graham . It was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated , male and female lineup . Formed in 1966 , the group 's music synthesized a variety of disparate musical genres to help pioneer the emerging psychedelic soul sound . They released a series of Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits such as Dance to the Music ( 1968 ) , Everyday People ( 1968 ) , and Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin ) ( 1969 ) , as well as critically acclaimed albums such as Stand ! ( 1969 ) , which combined pop sensibility with social commentary . In the 1970s , it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as There 's a Riot Goin ' On ( 1971 ) and Fresh ( 1973 ) , proving as influential as their early work . By 1975 , drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution , though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name Sly and the Family Stone until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987 . The work of Sly and the Family Stone greatly influenced the sound of subsequent American funk , pop , soul , R & B , and hip hop music . Music critic Joel Selvin wrote , there are two types of black music : black music before Sly Stone , and black music after Sly Stone . In 2010 , they were ranked 43rd in Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time , and three of their albums are included on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .",
  "/wiki/A_Wild_and_Crazy_Guy": "A Wild and Crazy Guy ( 1978 ) is an album by American comedian Steve Martin . It reached number two on Billboard 's Pop Albums Chart . The album was eventually certified double platinum . It contains the hit novelty single King Tut , which Martin also performed on Saturday Night Live . It also has Martin revealing his 'real ' name , which he admits is the sound of him flipping his lips . The album was released just as his celebrity status grew and the format reflects this . The first half of the album was performed in front of a small audience at The Boarding House in San Francisco , California , where his previous album had been recorded . The second half of the album was performed at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre . The switchover between venues is handled in a clever segue in the opening minute of the track A Wild and Crazy Guy which opened Side Two of the original vinyl long-player - Steve reads a bogus financial disclosure report to the audience at The Boarding House nightclub , and when he gets to calculating concert revenues he reveals his desire to make over $ 2 million on a single show ; the audience reaction quickly segues from the enclosed intimacy of The Boarding House to the far more raucous open amphitheatre of Red Rocks near Denver . Martin reprises his role as Georg , one of the Czech Festrunk Brothers ( a role he had popularized with Dan Aykroyd on Saturday Night Live ) on two tracks - the second half of A Wild and Crazy Guy and You Naive Americans . The album won the Grammy Award in 1979 for Best Comedy Album . In 2015 , the album was deemed culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant by the Library of Congress and selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry .",

While he has played banjo since an early age , and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career , he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s , acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo , recording , and touring with various bluegrass acts , including Earl Scruggs , with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002 . He released his first solo music album , The Crow : New Songs for the 5-String Banjo , in 2009 , for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album ."
