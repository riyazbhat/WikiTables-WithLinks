Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension .",
  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 ( Hayk ) ; however , it is currently rarely used . The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The Ancient Greek terms \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ( Armen\u00eda ) and \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( Arm\u00e9nioi , Armenians ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC - c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . Some scholars have linked the name Armenia with the Early Bronze Age state of Armani ( Armanum , Armi ) or the Late Bronze Age state of Arme ( Shupria ) . These connections are inconclusive as it is not known what languages were spoken in these kingdoms .",

  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",
  "/wiki/Firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck .",

  "/wiki/Robbery": "Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force , threat of force , or by putting the victim in fear . According to common law , robbery is defined as taking the property of another , with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property , by means of force or fear ; that is , it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault . Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions . Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft ( such as burglary , shoplifting , pickpocketing , or car theft ) by its inherently violent nature ( a violent crime ) ; whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors , robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two . Under English law , most forms of theft are triable either way , whereas robbery is triable only on indictment . The word rob came via French from Late Latin words ( e.g. , deraubare ) of Germanic origin , from Common Germanic raub theft . Among the types of robbery are armed robbery , which involves the use of a weapon , and aggravated robbery , when someone brings with them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon . Highway robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a public place such as a sidewalk , street , or parking lot . Carjacking is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force . Extortion is the threat to do something illegal , or the offer to not do something illegal , in the event that goods are not given , primarily using words instead of actions .

Only certain drugs are banned with a blanket prohibition against all possession or use ( e.g. , LSD , a psychedelic that was once used medicinally ) . The most widely banned substances include psychoactive drugs , although blanket prohibition also extends to some steroids and other drugs . Many governments do not criminalize the possession of a limited quantity of certain drugs for personal use , while still prohibiting their sale or manufacture , or possession in large quantities . Some laws set a specific volume of a particular drug , above which is considered ipso jure to be evidence of trafficking or sale of the drug .

The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE and was divided into several Hellenistic states . An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE , which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire , a leading world power for the next four centuries . Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE , and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion . Iran 's major contributions to art , philosophy , and science spread throughout the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age .",

The capital , and largest city , is Baghdad . Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs , Kurds , Assyrians , Turkmen , Shabakis , Yazidis , Armenians , Mandeans , Circassians and Kawliya . Around 99 % of the country 's 38 million citizens are Muslims , with tiny minorities of Christians , Yarsans , Yezidis and Mandeans also present . The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish . Iraq has a coastline measuring 58 km ( 36 miles ) on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain , the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert . Two major rivers , the Tigris and Euphrates , run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf . These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land . The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , historically known as Mesopotamia , is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation . It was here that mankind first began to read , write , create laws and live in cities under an organised government - notably Uruk , from which Iraq is derived . The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC . Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian , Sumerian , Assyrian and Babylonian empires .",

The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition . [ fn 4 ] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa . Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

He was tasked by SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich with facilitating and managing the logistics involved in the mass deportation of Jews to ghettos and extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe during World War II . Eichmann was captured by the Mossad in Argentina on 11 May 1960 and subsequently found guilty of war crimes in a widely publicised trial in Jerusalem , where he was executed by hanging in 1962 . After an unremarkable school career , Eichmann briefly worked for his father 's mining company in Austria , where the family had moved in 1914 . He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927 , and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932 . He returned to Germany in 1933 , where he joined the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD , Security Service ) ; there he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs - especially emigration , which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure . After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas . He also drew up plans for a Jewish reservation , first at Nisko in southeast Poland and later in Madagascar , but neither of these plans were ever carried out . The Nazis began the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , and their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination . To co-ordinate planning for the genocide , Heydrich , who was Eichmann 's superior , hosted the regime 's administrative leaders at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 . Eichmann collected information for him , attended the conference , and prepared the minutes . Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to extermination camps , where the victims were gassed .",
  "/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity": "Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population . The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials . Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts ( for example , the International Court of Justice , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , and the International Criminal Court ) as well as in domestic prosecutions . The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law . Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention , although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty , led by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative . Unlike war crimes , crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war . They are not isolated or sporadic events , but are part either of a government policy ( although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy ) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority . War crimes , murder , massacres , dehumanization , genocide , ethnic cleansing , deportations , unethical human experimentation , extrajudicial punishments including summary executions , use of weapons of mass destruction , state terrorism or state sponsoring of terrorism , death squads , kidnappings and forced disappearances , use of child soldiers , unjust imprisonment , enslavement , torture , rape , political repression , racial discrimination , religious persecution and other human rights abuses may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

  "/wiki/Rape": "Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person 's consent . The act may be carried out by physical force , coercion , abuse of authority , or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent , such as one who is unconscious , incapacitated , has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent . The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault . The rate of reporting , prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions . Internationally , the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged , per 100,000 people , from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median . Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group . People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder . Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections ."
