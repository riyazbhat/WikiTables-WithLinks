  "/wiki/Ontario": "Ontario is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada . Located in Central Canada , it is Canada 's most populous province , with 38.3 percent of the country 's population , and is the second-largest province in total area . Ontario is fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included . It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York . Almost all of Ontario 's 2,700 km ( 1,678 mi ) border with the United States follows inland waterways : from the westerly Lake of the Woods , eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system . These include Rainy River , Pigeon River , Lake Superior , St. Marys River , Lake Huron , St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , Lake Erie , Niagara River , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston , Ontario , to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall , Ontario . There is only about 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) of land border , made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border . Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions , Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario . The great majority of Ontario 's population and arable land is in the south . In contrast , the larger , northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation .",
  "/wiki/CN_Tower": "The CN Tower ( French : Tour CN ) is a 553.3 m-high ( 1,815.3 ft ) concrete communications and observation tower located in Downtown Toronto , Ontario , Canada . Built on the former Railway Lands , it was completed in 1976 . Its name CN originally referred to Canadian National , the railway company that built the tower . Following the railway 's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company 's privatization in 1995 , it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company , a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development . The CN Tower held the record for the world 's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years until 2007 when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa and was the world 's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower . It is now the ninth tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere . In 1995 , the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers . It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers . It is a signature icon of Toronto 's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually .",
  "/wiki/Tower": "A tower is a tall structure , taller than it is wide , often by a significant factor . Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore , along with tall buildings , self-supporting structures . Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions . The principal function is the use of their height to enable various functions to be achieved including : visibility of other features attached to the tower such as clock towers ; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a castle ; as a structure for observation for leisure purposes ; or as a structure for telecommunication purposes . Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building .",
  "/wiki/Newfoundland": "Newfoundland and Labrador is the easternmost province of Canada . Situated in the country 's Atlantic region , it is composed of the insular region of Newfoundland and the continental region of Labrador to the northwest , with a combined area of 405,212 square kilometres ( 156,500 sq mi ) . In 2018 , the province 's population was estimated at 525,073 . About 92 % of the province 's population lives on the island of Newfoundland ( and its neighbouring smaller islands ) , of whom more than half live on the Avalon Peninsula . The province is Canada 's most linguistically homogeneous , with 97.0 % of residents reporting English ( Newfoundland English ) as their mother tongue in the 2016 census . Historically , Newfoundland was also home to unique varieties of French and Irish , as well as the extinct Beothuk language . In Labrador , the indigenous languages Innu-aimun and Inuktitut are also spoken . Newfoundland and Labrador 's capital and largest city , St. John 's , is Canada 's 20th-largest census metropolitan area and is home to almost 40 per cent of the province 's population . St. John 's is the seat of government , home to the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the highest court in the jurisdiction , the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal . A former colony and then dominion of the United Kingdom , Newfoundland gave up its independence in 1933 , following significant economic distress caused by the Great Depression and the aftermath of Newfoundland 's participation in World War I . It became the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on 31 March 1949 , as Newfoundland . On 6 December 2001 , an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province 's name to Newfoundland and Labrador .",
  "/wiki/Cape_Race_LORAN-C_transmitter": "The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter was a LORAN-C transmitter at Cape Race , Newfoundland and Labrador , on Canada 's eastern seaboard . The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter was used as an antenna tower until February 2 , 1993 . It was a 411.48 m ( 1350 ft ) tall guyed mast , built in 1965 . This mast was the tallest structure in Canada until the construction of the CN Tower in Toronto , and remained the second-tallest structure until its collapse on February 2 , 1993 . The collapse was the result of a fatigue failure of the eyebolt head in a compression cone insulator on a structural guy-wire . This failure caused swing-in damage that resulted in the tower 's collapse . The tower was replaced by a 260.3 meter ( 854 ft ) tall guyed mast , insulated against the ground . The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter was used until 1993 as part of the LORAN-C Chain GRI 9930 and worked with a transmission power of 1800 kilowatts . Today the Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter acts as the Yankee Secondary Transmitter of the Canadian East Coast LORAN-C chain ( GRI 5930 ) and as the Whiskey Secondary of the Newfoundland East Coast LORAN-C chain ( GRI 7270 ) . The transmission power for the Canadian East Coast LORAN-C chain is 1000 kW , and for the Newfoundland East Coast LORAN-C the transmission power is 500 kW .",
  "/wiki/Guyed_mast": "A guyed mast is a tall thin vertical structure that depends on guy lines for stability . The mast itself has the compressive strength to support its own weight , but does not have the shear strength to stand unsupported , and requires guy lines to resist lateral forces such as wind loads and keep it upright . Guy lines are diagonal tensioned cables attached to the ground , usually spaced at equal angles about the structure 's base . Guyed masts are frequently used for radio antennas . The mast can either support aerials ( for VHF and UHF ) mounted at its top , or the entire structure itself can function as an antenna ( for VLF , LF , MF ) ; this is called a mast radiator . In the latter case , the mast needs to be insulated from the ground . Guyed radio masts are typically tall enough that they require several sets of guy lines , 2 to 4 , attached at different heights on the mast , to prevent them from buckling . An exception was the Blaw-Knox tower , widely used during the 1930s , whose distinctive wide diamond ( rhomboidal ) shape gave it the shear strength that it only required one set of guys . Sailing masts , the masts that support the sails on sailboats , are also typically guyed masts . Guyed masts are sometimes also used for meteorological measurements at certain heights above ground level . Sometimes they are used as pylons , although their usage in agricultural areas is problematic because anchor foundations handicap ploughing . A partially guyed tower is a structure consisting of a guyed mast on top of a freestanding tower .",
  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",

  "/wiki/Smokestack": "A chimney is an architectural ventilation structure made of masonry , clay or metal that isolates hot toxic exhaust gases or smoke produced by a boiler , stove , furnace , incinerator or fireplace from human living areas . Chimneys are typically vertical , or as near as possible to vertical , to ensure that the gases flow smoothly , drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack , or chimney effect . The space inside a chimney is called the flue . Chimneys are adjacent to large industrial refineries , fossil fuel combustion facilities or part of buildings , steam locomotives and ships . In the United States , the term 'Smokestack industry ' refers to the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels by industrial society including the electric industry during its earliest history . The term smokestack ( colloquially , stack ) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys , and the term funnel can also be used . The height of a chimney influences its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via stack effect . Additionally , the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce their impact on the immediate surroundings . The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits .",

  "/wiki/Skyscraper": "A skyscraper is a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m ( 492 ft ) . Historically , the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s . The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th century . Skyscrapers may host offices , residential spaces , and retail spaces . For buildings above a height of 300 m ( 984 ft ) , the term supertall skyscrapers can be used , while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m ( 1,969 ft ) are classified as megatall skyscrapers . One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls . These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above , rather than resting on load-bearing walls of conventional construction . Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls . However , skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows . Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure , and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist wind , seismic , and other lateral loads . To appear more slender , allow less wind exposure and transmit more daylight to the ground , many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks , which in some cases is also structurally required .",

  "/wiki/Oil_platform": "An oil platform , offshore platform , or offshore drilling rig is a large structure with facilities for well drilling to explore , extract , store , and process petroleum and natural gas that lies in rock formations beneath the seabed . Many oil platforms will also contain facilities to accommodate their workforce . Most commonly , oil platforms engage in activities on the continental shelf , though they can also be used in lakes , inshore waters , and inland seas . Depending on the circumstances , the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor , consist of an artificial island , or float . Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections . These sub-sea solutions may consist of one or more subsea wells or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells . Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges , both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation . Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate . There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place . These include bottom founded drilling rigs ( jackup barges and swamp barges ) , combined drilling and production facilities , either bottom founded or floating platforms , and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units ( MODU ) , including semi-submersibles and drillships . These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3,000 metres ( 9,800 ft ) . In shallower waters , the mobile units are anchored to the seabed .",

Its area of 55,284 square kilometres ( 21,345 sq mi ) includes Cape Breton Island and 3,800 other coastal islands . The peninsula that makes up Nova Scotia 's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the Isthmus of Chignecto , on which the province 's land border with New Brunswick is located . The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years .

A thermal generating station , Tufts Cove was constructed in 1965 by Nova Scotia Light and Power Company , Limited , requiring the demolition of part of this historic neighbourhood to locate the facility on the eastern shore of Halifax Harbour . The plant replaced the Water Street Generating Station that had been opened by the Halifax Electric Tramway in 1902 . Now operated by Nova Scotia Power , a subsidiary of Emera Incorporated , the Tufts Cove Generating Station has a generating capacity of 415 megawatts . Tufts Cove # 1 was installed in 1965 with dual fuel capability to burn Bunker C heavy fuel oil and coal mined by the Cape Breton Development Corporation . In 1972 Tufts Cove # 1 was converted to fire only oil at the same time as Tufts Cove # 2 ( oil only ) was commissioned . Tufts Cove # 3 ( also oil only ) was commissioned in 1976 . The sole reliance on fuel oil proved to be an unfortunate decision in the light of the record increase in oil prices throughout the 1970s . The plant property occupies almost 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) of shoreline . A docking facility was constructed in 1976-1977 as well as a storage tank .

A thermal generating station , Trenton was opened on the bank of the East River of Trenton by then-provincial Crown corporation Nova Scotia Power Corporation in 1969 . It was designed to burn coal mined nearby in Pictou County as well as on Cape Breton Island . The plant burns coal and features two boilers and two chimneys ; one 152 m ( 500 ft ) and one 92 m ( 300 ft ) . The plant consumes 0.8 million tonnes of coal per year and currently generates approximately 12 % of the province 's electricity and produces roughly 10 % of the province 's air pollution , including hydrochloric acid , sulphuric acid , hexachlorobenzene and mercury . Emissions from the station in the form of particulates are a frequent source of pollution complaints in the neighbourhood and region . However , both Trenton units have electrostatic precipitators designed to capture 99 % of fly ash emissions from coal burning . From its inception in 1969 until 2001 , Trenton 's coal was largely sourced on Cape Breton Island from the Cape Breton Development Corporation ( DEVCO ) . Coal was transported to Trenton from Sydney by rail using CN Rail and later the Cape Breton & Central Nova Scotia Railway . During the fall-winter-spring of 1991-1992 , the generating station burnt locally mined coal from the Westray Mine , located several kilometres south of the plant ; the mine was permanently closed on May 9 , 1992 after a disastrous methane gas explosion destroyed the mine , killing 26 workers . Trenton GS burns coal from the nearby Stellarton Surface Coal Mine which is part of a reclamation project for land that was previously the location of an underground mine . Following the closure of DEVCO mines in 2001 , Trenton GS was supplied with coal imported from the United States and South America , shipped to a bulk unloading terminal on the Strait of Canso at Point Tupper , then taken by CB & CNS trains to Trenton .",
  "/wiki/Lingan_Generating_Station": "The Lingan Generating Station is a 620 MW Canadian electrical generating station located in the community of Lingan in Nova Scotia 's Cape Breton Regional Municipality . A thermal generating station , Lingan was opened by then-provincial Crown corporation Nova Scotia Power Corporation on November 1 , 1979 at the height of the 1970s oil crisis . It was designed to burn coal mined nearby by the Cape Breton Development Corporation ( DEVCO ) as a means of reducing Nova Scotia 's reliance of foreign oil for electrical generation . The plant burns coal and features four boilers and two 152 m ( 500 ft ) chimneys . The plant consumes 1.5 million tonnes of coal per year and currently generates approximately twenty-five percent of the province 's electricity , while producing roughly fifty percent of the province 's air pollution , including hydrochloric acid , sulphuric acid , hexachlorobenzene and mercury . Emissions in the form of particulates are a frequent source of pollution complaints in the neighbourhood and region . Until the 2001 shut down of coal production by DEVCO , Lingan was supplied almost exclusively with locally mined coal from the Sydney Coal Field . Following closure of its mines , Nova Scotia Power purchased the federal Crown corporation 's surface assets , including shipping piers on Sydney Harbour and the Devco Railway which was used to haul coal to the Lingan Generating Station . Nova Scotia Power subcontracted with the Quebec Railway Corporation to operate this rail line as the Sydney Coal Railway . In order to meet emissions standards , the company now imports coal containing fewer pollutants from the United States and South America , which is hauled from the Port of Sydney by the SCR to the generating station . In 2005 , Nova Scotia Power announced a $ 100 million upgrade for the Lingan Generating Station , including the installation of a scrubber ( flue gas desulphurization ) or FGD and low nitrogen oxide burners . The scrubbers were installed from 2006 to 2008 on all four boilers .",

  "/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island": "Prince Edward Island ( PEI ) is a province of Canada and one of the three Maritime Provinces . It is the smallest province of Canada in both land area and population , but it is the most densely populated . Part of the traditional lands of the Mi'kmaq , it became a British colony in the 1700s and was federated into Canada as a province in 1873 . Its capital is Charlottetown . According to Statistics Canada , the province of PEI has 155,318 residents . The backbone of the island economy is farming ; it produces 25 % of Canada 's potatoes . Other important industries include the fisheries , tourism , aerospace , bio-science , IT , and renewable energy . The island has several informal names : Garden of the Gulf , referring to the pastoral scenery and lush agricultural lands throughout the province ; and Birthplace of Confederation or Cradle of Confederation , referring to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 , although PEI did not join Confederation until 1873 , when it became the seventh Canadian province . Historically , PEI is one of Canada 's older settlements and demographically still reflects older immigration to the country , with Scottish , Irish , English and French surnames being dominant . PEI is located about 200 kilometres ( 120 miles ) north of Halifax , Nova Scotia , and 600 kilometres ( 370 miles ) east of Quebec City and has a land area of 5,686.03 km2 ( 2,195.39 sq mi ) . The main island is 5,620 km2 ( 2,170 sq mi ) in size . It is the 104th-largest island in the world and Canada 's 23rd-largest island .",
  "/wiki/Charlottetown_Thermal_Generating_Station": "Charlottetown Thermal Generating Station is a natural diesel oil power station owned by Maritime Electric , in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island . The plant is primarily used during periods of peak demand or when the power supply from the mainline is impaired . The plant was the main source of electricity for the island until the first cable to the mainland was finished in 1977 . The station is currently being decommissioned , and as a result its two smokestacks will be torn down . Now that two new cables have been finished in 2017 , there is n't even a need for the plant as a backup ."
