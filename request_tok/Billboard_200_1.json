  "/wiki/21_(Adele_album)": "21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele . It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records . The album was named after the age of the singer during its production . 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19 , but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008-09 North American tour An Evening with Adele . Composed in the aftermath of the singer 's separation from her then partner , the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak , self-examination , and forgiveness . Adele began writing 21 in April 2009 , when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record . Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut , she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up . However , studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration . She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship , channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs . Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers , including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin , Paul Epworth , Ryan Tedder , Jim Abbiss , and Dan Wilson . Praised by critics for its understated production , vintage aesthetic , and Adele 's vocal performance , 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings . The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world 's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012 .",
