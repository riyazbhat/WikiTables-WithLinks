No opening or closing ceremonies were held ; competitions began on 14 May and ended on 28 October . The Games were held as part of the 1900 World 's Fair . In total , 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports . This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not Olympic . Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration . Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals , but were given cups or trophies .",

This included Bastille Day , which is a French holiday , and then Sunday , which many of the American athletes protested . Even with many Americans not competing in finals because of confusion caused by the organizers ' decision to count scores achieved on Monday , 16 July for finals held on Sunday , 15 July and subsequent rescission of that decision , the United States won more than 4 times as many medals as any other nation , including 16 of the 23 gold medals . The conditions of competition were also subpar compared even to those at the previous games in 1896 .

It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games . To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 , Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built , as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas . The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime .

The 1948 Olympic Games were the first of two summer Olympic Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . The event came to be known as the Austerity Games , because of the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II . No new venues were built for the games ( with events taking place mainly at Empire Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park ) , and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village , as were the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki .

Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system .
