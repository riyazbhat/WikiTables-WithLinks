  "/wiki/Weezer_(1994_album)": "Weezer ( commonly known as the Blue Album ) is the eponymous debut studio album by American rock band Weezer , released on May 10 , 1994 by DGC Records . The album came two years after the band 's founding , after they initially struggled as an alternative to grunge music , which was prevalent in Los Angeles during the early 1990s . It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman Rivers Cuomo , who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album . However , at the behest of DGC , the band was required to include a producer , and collectively opted for Cars frontman Ric Ocasek . Most of the recording was conducted at Electric Lady Studios in New York City between August and September 1993 , a period that coincided with founding guitarist Jason Cropper being fired and replaced by Brian Bell . Under Ocasek 's direction , the band opted for a brighter sound , while lead bassist Matt Sharp collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments , thus maximizing its potential when united . As a result , Weezer is notable for its various solos , namely those performed by Sharp and Cuomo . Lyrically , Weezer focuses on outsiderdom and social awkwardness , while also touching on melancholic themes of love , romance , and familial issues . Weezer was supported by the singles Undone - The Sweater Song , Buddy Holly , and Say It Ai n't So , which , alongside their respective music videos , brought Weezer mainstream success . The album itself peaked at number sixteen on the US Billboard 200 , and was certified triple platinum by 1995 . It is also the band 's best-selling album , having sold at least 3.3 million copies in the U.S. and over fifteen million copies worldwide by 2009 .",
