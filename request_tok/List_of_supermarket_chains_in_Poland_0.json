  "/wiki/Convenience_store": "A convenience store , convenience shop , or corner store is a small retail business that stocks a range of everyday items such as coffee , groceries , snack foods , confectionery , soft drinks , tobacco products , over-the-counter drugs , toiletries , newspapers , and magazines . In some jurisdictions , convenience stores are licensed to sell alcohol , although many such jurisdictions limit such beverages to those with relatively low alcoholic content such as beer and wine .

They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger stores . A convenience store may be part of a gas/petrol station , so customers can purchase goods conveniently while filling their vehicle with fuel . It may be located alongside a busy road , in an urban area , near a railway or railroad station , or at another transport hub . In some countries , convenience stores have long shopping hours , and some remain open 24 hours . Convenience stores usually charge significantly higher prices than conventional grocery stores or supermarkets , as these stores order smaller quantities of inventory at higher per-unit prices from wholesalers . However , convenience stores make up for this loss by having longer open hours , serving more locations , and having shorter cashier lines",
