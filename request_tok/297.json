  "/wiki/Water_wheel": "A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of flowing or falling water into useful forms of power , often in a watermill . A water wheel consists of a wheel ( usually constructed from wood or metal ) , with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface . Water wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century but they are no longer in common use . Uses included milling flour in gristmills , grinding wood into pulp for papermaking , hammering wrought iron , machining , ore crushing and pounding fiber for use in the manufacture of cloth . Some water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond , which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed . A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a mill race . The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a headrace ; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace . In the mid to late 18th century John Smeaton 's scientific investigation of the water wheel led to significant increases in efficiency supplying much needed power for the Industrial Revolution . Water wheels began being displaced by the smaller , less expensive and more efficient turbine , developed by Beno\u00eet Fourneyron , beginning with his first model in 1827 . Turbines are capable of handling high heads , or elevations , that exceed the capability of practical-sized waterwheels . The main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water , which limits where they can be located . Modern hydroelectric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel , as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill .",

East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous Renaissance drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of Vitruvian Man . He was also the one who , in 40 BCE , invented the idea that all buildings should have three attributes : firmitas , utilitas , and venustas , meaning : strength , utility , and beauty . These principles were later adopted by the Romans . By his own description Vitruvius served as an artilleryman , the third class of arms in the military offices . He probably served as a senior officer of artillery in charge of doctores ballistarum ( artillery experts ) and libratores who actually operated the machines .",
  "/wiki/Kneading": "Kneading is a process in the making of bread or pasta dough , used to mix the ingredients and add strength to the final product . Its importance lies in the mixing of flour with water . When these two ingredients are combined and kneaded , the gliadin and glutenin proteins in the flour expand and form strands of gluten , which gives bread its texture . ( To aid gluten production , many recipes use bread flour , which is higher in protein than all-purpose flour . ) The kneading process warms and stretches these gluten strands , eventually creating a springy and elastic dough . If bread dough is not kneaded enough , it will not be able to hold the tiny pockets of gas ( CO2 ) created by the leavening agent ( such as yeast or baking powder ) , and will collapse , leaving a heavy and dense loaf . Kneading can be performed by hand ( the traditional way ) , with a mixer equipped with a dough hook , or with a bread machine . In hand kneading , the dough is put on a floured surface , pressed and stretched with the heel of the hand , folded over , and rotated through 90\u00b0 repeatedly . This process continues until the dough is elastic and smooth . The dough can then be allowed to rise or prove . Similar to kneading is knocking back or punching down , which is done to the dough after proving . The dough is punched once or twice , after which it is kneaded gently for a short time .",

  "/wiki/Trip_hammer": "A trip hammer , also known as a tilt hammer or helve hammer , is a massive powered hammer . Traditional uses of trip hammers include pounding , decorticating and polishing of grain in agriculture . In mining , trip hammers were used for crushing metal ores into small pieces , although a stamp mill was more usual for this . In finery forges they were used for drawing out blooms made from wrought iron into more workable bar iron . They were also used for fabricating various articles of wrought iron , latten ( an early form of brass ) , steel and other metals . One or more trip hammers were set up in a forge , also known variously as a hammer mill , hammer forge or hammer works . The hammers were usually raised by a cam and then released to fall under the force of gravity . Historically , trip hammers were often powered hydraulically by a water wheel . Trip hammers are known to have been used in Imperial China since the Western Han dynasty . They also existed in the contemporary Greco-Roman world , with more evidence of their use in medieval Europe during the 12th century . During the Industrial Revolution the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the power hammer . Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of line shafts , pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply .",

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

  "/wiki/Sawmill": "A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber . Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces , and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ( dimensional lumber ) . The portable saw mill is iconic and of simple operation - the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed , by the operator manually pushing the saw . The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig ( Alaskan saw mill ) , with similar horizontal operation . Before the invention of the sawmill , boards were made in various manual ways , either rived ( split ) and planed , hewn , or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw , one above and another in a saw pit below . The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill , a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis , Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD . Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , and in the next few centuries , spread across Europe . The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade . Generally , only the saw was powered , and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand . An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage , also water powered , to move the log steadily through the saw blade . By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , the circular saw blade had been invented , and with the development of steam power in the 19th century , a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible . Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler .",
  "/wiki/Crank_(mechanism)": "A crank is an arm attached at a right angle to a rotating shaft by which reciprocating motion is imparted to or received from the shaft . It is used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion , or vice versa . The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft , or a separate arm or disk attached to it . Attached to the end of the crank by a pivot is a rod , usually called a connecting rod ( conrod ) . The term often refers to a human-powered crank which is used to manually turn an axle , as in a bicycle crankset or a brace and bit drill . In this case a person 's arm or leg serves as the connecting rod , applying reciprocating force to the crank . There is usually a bar perpendicular to the other end of the arm , often with a freely rotatable handle or pedal attached .",
  "/wiki/Connecting_rod": "A connecting rod , also called a con rod , is the part of a piston engine which connects the piston to the crankshaft . Together with the crank , the connecting rod converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotation of the crankshaft . The connecting rod is required to transmit the compressive and tensile forces from the piston , and rotate at both ends . The predecessor to the connecting rod is a mechanic linkage used by water mills to convert rotating motion of the water wheel into reciprocating motion . The most common usage of connecting rods is in internal combustion engines and steam engines .",
  "/wiki/Gear": "A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or , in the case of a cogwheel , inserted teeth ( called cogs ) , which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque . Geared devices can change the speed , torque , and direction of a power source . Gears almost always produce a change in torque , creating a mechanical advantage , through their gear ratio , and thus may be considered a simple machine . The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape . Two or more meshing gears , working in a sequence , are called a gear train or a transmission . A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part , called a rack , producing translation instead of rotation . The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed , belt pulley system . An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage . When two gears mesh , if one gear is bigger than the other , a mechanical advantage is produced , with the rotational speeds , and the torques , of the two gears differing in proportion to their diameters . In transmissions with multiple gear ratios - such as bicycles , motorcycles , and cars - the term gear as in first gear refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear . The term describes similar devices , even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete , or when the device does not actually contain gears , as in a continuously variable transmission .",
