The Speaker is elected by the members of the house when they first convene for their regular session , which is currently in January of each odd-numbered year . Perhaps the most important duty of the Speaker is to appoint members and chairs of the various standing committees of the House . The office evolved from the office of Speaker of the lower house of the legislature in the Province of Carolina , called the House of Burgesses . Since the House was the only elected body in the colony , the Speaker was often seen as the leading voice of the people . In 1776 , North Carolina created its first constitution , which established a Senate and a House of Commons , both of which were elected by voters . In the 1868 North Carolina Constitution , the name of the house was changed to House of Representatives . For most of the twentieth century , the office 's power was limited , because Speakers usually only served for a single legislative session . This changed with Speakers Carl J. Stewart , Jr. ( 1977-1980 ) , Liston B. Ramsey ( 1981-1988 ) and James B . Black ( 1999-2006 ) . Democrats held the speaker 's chair continuously from 1899 until 1994 , when Republicans gained a majority and elected Harold J. Brubaker in January 1995 .

The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere",
