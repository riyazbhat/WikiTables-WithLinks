The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander III of Macedon , the Seleucid Empire , the Indian Maurya Empire , the Gupta Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Afghan Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire ( partially ) and , most recently , the British Indian Empire .

  "/wiki/Mughal_emperors": "The Mughal Emperors , Moghul , from the early 16th century to the mid 19th century , built and ruled the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent , mainly corresponding to the modern countries of India , Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh . The Mughals emerged as a branch of the Timurid dynasty of Turco-Mongol origin from Central Asia . Their founder Babur , a Timurid prince from the Fergana Valley ( in modern Uzbekistan ) , was a direct descendant of Timur ( generally known in western nations as Tamerlane ) and also affiliated with Genghis Khan through Timur 's marriage to a Genghisid princess . Many of the later Mughal emperors had significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances as emperors were born to Rajput and Persian princesses . Akbar , for instance , was half-Persian ( his mother was of Persian origin ) , Jahangir was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian , and Shah Jahan was three-quarters Rajput . During Aurangzeb 's Islamic sharia based government , the empire , as the world 's largest economy , worth over 25 % of world GDP , controlled all of the Indian subcontinent , extending from Chittagong in the east to Kabul and Baluchistan in the west , Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri River basin in the south . Its population at the time has been estimated as between 110 and 150 million ( a quarter of the world 's population ) , over a territory of more than 4 million square kilometres ( 1.2 million square miles ) .

Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire , Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri , and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent . He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise , though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history . He was a notable expansionist ; during his reign , the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent , ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent . During his lifetime , victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres , and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects , with an annual revenue of $ 450 million ( more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France ) , or \u00a338,624,680 ( 2,879,469,894 rupees ) in 1690 . Under his reign , India surpassed Qing China to become the world 's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power , worth nearly a quarter of global GDP and more than the entirety of Western Europe , and its largest and wealthiest subdivision , the Bengal Subah , signaled the proto-industrialization . Aurangzeb was noted for his religious piety ; he memorized the entire Quran , studied hadiths and stringently observed the rituals of Islam . Unlike his predecessors , including his father Shah Jahan , Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire . He did not enjoy a luxurious life and his personal expenses and constructions of small mosques were covered by his own earnings , which included the sewing of caps and trade of his written copies of the Quran . He also patronized works of Islamic and Arabic calligraphy . Aurangzeb has been subject to criticism . Critics argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors ' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance , citing his introduction of the jizya tax and other policies based on Islamic ethics , demolition of Hindu temples , the executions of his elder brother Dara Shikoh , Maratha king Sambhaji and the ninth Sikh guru Tegh Bahadur , [ a ] and the prohibition and supervision of behaviour and activities that are forbidden in Islam such as music , gambling , fornication , and consumption of alcohol and narcotic",

  "/wiki/Mughal_architecture": "Mughal Architecture is the type of Indo-Islamic architecture developed by the Mughals in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the Indian subcontinent . It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of Islamic , Persian , Turkish and Indian architecture . Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character , including large bulbous domes , slender minarets at the corners , massive halls , large vaulted gateways , and delicate ornamentation ; grandiose architecture was the most visible of the ways that the Mughals used to assert their sense of superiority and their supremacy over what in many ways remained to them an alien land . Examples of the style can be found in modern-day India , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , and Pakistan . The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of Babur at Panipat in 1526 . During his five-year reign , Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings , though few have survived . His grandson Akbar built widely , and the style developed vigorously during his reign . Among his accomplishments were Agra Fort , the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri , and the Buland Darwaza .

It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan 's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names . Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy , though it is geographically the smallest of four . Within Pakistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab , Balochistan , Azad Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad . It is home to 17.9 % of Pakistan 's total population , with the majority of the province 's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers . The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0 % as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb . On March 2 , 2017 , the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations , which are currently applicable to the tribal areas . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan",

Although modern Harappa has a legacy railway station from the British Raj period , it is a small crossroads town of 15,000 people today . The site of the ancient city contains the ruins of a Bronze Age fortified city , which was part of the Indus Valley Civilisation centred in Sindh and the Punjab , and then the Cemetery H culture .

Per archaeological convention of naming a previously unknown civilisation by its first excavated site , the Indus Valley Civilisation is also called the Harappan Civilisation . The ancient city of Harappa was heavily damaged under British rule , when bricks from the ruins were used as track ballast in the construction of the Lahore-Multan Railway . In 2005 , a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artifacts during the early stages of building work . A plea from the Pakistani archaeologist Mohit Prem Kumar to the Ministry of Culture resulted in a restoration of the site",
