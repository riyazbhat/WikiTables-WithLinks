Their nickname is the Smithies , which was a nickname given to the school 's teams by an early sports editor of the Wooster Daily Record . The colors of green and white came from the town 's location within Green Township . Long-time athletic director and coach Wilbur Berkey designed the horseshoe and anvil logo the school uses . In 1955 , Marshallville 's district was merged with Smithville 's . This was done in order to prevent the transporting of Marshallville students across Orrville 's district into Dalton , where Marshallville had sent their students since their school 's closure in 1938 . The merger enabled Smithville to start up a football program in the WCAL . The Marshallville Tigers had previously competed in the WCAL as well . Due to the recent success of all three teams , Smithville 's football team also has a strong rivalry with both the Dalton High School Bulldogs and the Waynedale High School Golden Bears . All three schools have combined to either share or outright win the WCAL football title 43 times from 1955-2015 , and in that time frame there have only been 18 seasons where none of the three have contributed to a football championship .
