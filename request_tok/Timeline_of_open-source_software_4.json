  "/wiki/LibreOffice": "LibreOffice ( /\u02c8li\u02d0br\u0259/ ) is a free and open-source office suite , a project of The Document Foundation . It was forked in 2010 from OpenOffice.org , which was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice . The LibreOffice suite comprises programs for word processing , creating and editing of spreadsheets , slideshows , diagrams and drawings , working with databases , and composing mathematical formulae . It is available in 115 languages . As its native file format to save documents for all of its applications , LibreOffice uses the Open Document Format for Office Applications ( ODF ) , or OpenDocument , an international standard developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) . LibreOffice also supports the file formats of most other major office suites , including Microsoft Office , through a variety of import and export filters . LibreOffice is available for a variety of computing platforms , including Microsoft Windows , macOS , and Linux ( including a LibreOffice Viewer for Android ) , as well as in the form of an online office suite LibreOffice Online . It is the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions . It is the most actively developed free and open-source office suite , with approximately 50 times the development activity of Apache OpenOffice , the other major descendant of OpenOffice.org . The project was announced and a beta released on 28 September 2010 . Between January 2011 ( the first stable release ) and October 2011 , LibreOffice was downloaded approximately 7.5 million times . The project claims 120 million unique downloading addresses from May 2011 to May 2015 , excluding Linux distributions , with 55 million of those being from May 2014 to May 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",
  "/wiki/Smartphone": "Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices . They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems , which facilitate wider software , internet ( including web browsing over mobile broadband ) , and multimedia functionality ( including music , video , cameras , and gaming ) , alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging . Smartphones typically contain a number of metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) integrated circuit ( IC ) chips , include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software ( such as a magnetometer , proximity sensors , barometer , gyroscope , or accelerometer ) , and support wireless communications protocols ( such as Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , or satellite navigation ) . Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market , attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant ( PDA ) devices with support for cellular telephony , but were limited by their bulky form , short battery life , slow analog cellular networks , and the immaturity of wireless data services . These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub-micron levels ( Moore 's law ) , the improved lithium-ion battery , faster digital mobile data networks ( Edholm 's law ) , and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers . In the 2000s , NTT DoCoMo 's i-mode platform , BlackBerry , Nokia 's Symbian platform , and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction , with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input , and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet . Since the unveiling of the iPhone in 2007 , the majority of smartphones have featured thin , slate-like form factors , with large , capacitive screens with support for multi-touch gestures rather than physical keyboards , and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized store , and use cloud storage and synchronization , virtual assistants , as well as mobile payment services . Improved hardware and faster wireless communication ( due to standards such as LTE ) have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry . In the third quarter of 2012 , one billion smartphones were in use worldwide . Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Git": "Git ( /\u0261\u026at/ ) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development . It is designed for coordinating work among programmers , but it can be used to track changes in any set of files . Its goals include speed , data integrity , and support for distributed , non-linear workflows . Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel , with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development . Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano . As with most other distributed version-control systems , and unlike most client-server systems , every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities , independent of network access or a central server . Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 .",

  "/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets": "Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML . CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web , alongside HTML and JavaScript . CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content , including layout , colors , and fonts . This separation can improve content accessibility , provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics , enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file , and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content . Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods , such as on-screen , in print , by voice ( via speech-based browser or screen reader ) , and on Braille-based tactile devices . CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device . The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element . This cascading priority scheme is predictable . The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) . Internet media type ( MIME type ) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 ( March 1998 ) . The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents . In addition to HTML , other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML , plain XML , SVG , and XUL .",
  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",

  "/wiki/Internet_Explorer": "Internet Explorer [ a ] ( formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer [ b ] and Windows Internet Explorer , [ c ] commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE ) is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems , starting in 1995 . It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus ! for Windows 95 that year . Later versions were available as free downloads , or in service packs , and included in the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows . The browser is discontinued , but still maintained . Internet Explorer was once the most widely used web browser , attaining a peak of about 95% usage share by 2003 . This came after Microsoft used bundling to win the first browser war against Netscape , which was the dominant browser in the 1990s . Its usage share has since declined with the launch of Firefox ( 2004 ) and Google Chrome ( 2008 ) , and with the growing popularity of operating systems such as Android and iOS that do not support Internet Explorer . Estimates for Internet Explorer 's market share are about 1.7% across all platforms , or by StatCounter 's numbers ranked 8th . On traditional PCs ( e.g . excluding mobile and Xbox ) , the only platform on which it has ever had significant share it is ranked 5th at 3.7% , with Microsoft Edge , its successor , ranking 4th with a 4.7% market share ( and IE is also after Edge overall ) .

  "/wiki/Tablet_computer": "A tablet computer , commonly shortened to tablet , is a mobile device , typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry , and a rechargeable battery in a single , thin and flat package . Tablets , being computers , do what other personal computers do , but lack some input/output ( I/O ) abilities that others have . Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones , the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones , with screens 7 inches ( 18 cm ) or larger , measured diagonally , and may not support access to a cellular network . The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen ( stylus ) , instead of the mouse , trackpad , and keyboard of larger computers . Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards . Two species of tablet , the slate and booklet , do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays . To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard , most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB ; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards , distinct from tablets . The form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the 20th century ( Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 science fiction film A Space Odyssey ) and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century . In 2010 , Apple released the iPad , the first mass-market tablet to achieve widespread popularity . Thereafter tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and soon became a large product category used for personal , educational and workplace applications , with sales stabilizing in the mid-2010s .",

  "/wiki/Linux_adoption": "Linux adoption is the adoption of Linux computer operating systems ( OS ) by households , nonprofit organizations , businesses , and governments . Many factors have resulted in the expanded use of Linux systems by traditional desktop users as well as operators of server systems , including the desire to minimize software costs , increase network security and support for open-source philosophical principles . In recent years several governments , at various levels , have enacted policies shifting state-owned computers to Linux from proprietary software regimes . In August 2010 , Jeffrey Hammond , principal analyst at Forrester Research , declared , Linux has crossed the chasm to mainstream adoption , a statement attested by the large number of enterprises that had transitioned to Linux during the late-2000s recession . In a company survey completed in the third quarter of 2009 , 48% of surveyed companies reported using an open-source operating system . The Linux Foundation regularly releases publications regarding the Linux kernel , Linux OS distributions , and related themes . One such publication , Linux Adoption Trends : A Survey of Enterprise End Users , is freely available upon registration . Traditionally , the term Linux adoption , refers to adoption of a Linux OS made for desktop computers , the original intended use ( or adoption on servers , that is essentially the same form of OS ) . Adoption of that form on personal computers is still low relatively , while adoption of the Android operating system is very high . The term Linux adoption , often overlooks that operating system or other uses such as in Chrome OS that also use the Linux kernel ( but have almost nothing else in common , not even the name - Linux - usually applied ; while Android is the most popular variant - in fact the most popular operating system in the world ) ."
