  "/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum": "The 9\u00d719mm Parabellum is a firearms cartridge that was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken ( DWM ) ( German Weapons and Munitions Factory ) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol . For this reason , it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) , and the 9 mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives ( CIP ) . The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin : Si vis pacem , para bellum ( If you seek peace , prepare for war ) , which was the motto of DWM . Under STANAG 4090 , it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries . According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World , the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum is the world 's most popular and widely used military handgun and submachine gun cartridge . In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S. , Newsweek credits 9\u00d719mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers . The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use . Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber 's continuing popularity .",
  "/wiki/Wehrmacht": "The Wehrmacht ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8ve\u02d0\u0250\u032fmaxt ] ( listen ) , lit . defence force ) was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It consisted of the Heer ( army ) , the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr , and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime 's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted . After the Nazi rise to power in 1933 , one of Adolf Hitler 's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht , a modern offensively-capable armed force , fulfilling the Nazi regime 's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours . This required the reinstatement of conscription , and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry . The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany 's politico-military power . In the early part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics ( close cover air-support , tanks , and infantry ) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . Its campaigns in France ( 1940 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) , and North Africa ( 1941/42 ) are regarded as acts of boldness . At the same time , the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht 's capacity to the breaking point , culminating in the first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow ( 1941 ) ; by late 1942 , Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres . The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition , making the Wehrmacht 's weaknesses in strategy , doctrine , and logistics readily apparent . Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen , the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes , despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht .",
  "/wiki/Waffen-SS": "The Waffen-SS ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8vafn\u0329\u0294\u025bs\u02cc\u0294\u025bs ] ) was the military branch of the Nazi Party 's SS organisation . Its formations included men from Nazi Germany , along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and unoccupied lands . The Waffen-SS grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II , and served alongside the Heer ( regular army ) , Ordnungspolizei ( uniformed police ) and other security units . Originally , it was under the control of the SS F\u00fchrungshauptamt ( SS operational command office ) beneath Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler . With the start of World War II , tactical control was exercised by the High Command of the Armed Forces ( OKW ) , with some units being subordinated to Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ( Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ) directly under Himmler 's control . Initially , in keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany , membership was open only to people of Germanic origin ( so-called Aryan ancestry ) . The rules were partially relaxed in 1940 , and later the formation of units composed largely or solely of foreign volunteers and conscripts was authorised . These SS units were made up of men mainly from among the nationals of Nazi-occupied Europe . Despite relaxation of the rules , the Waffen-SS was still based on the racist ideology of Nazism , and ethnic Poles ( who were viewed as subhumans ) were specifically barred from the formations . Members of the Waffen-SS were involved in numerous atrocities . At the post-war Nuremberg trials , the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organisation due to its connection to the Nazi Party and direct involvement in numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity . Former Waffen-SS members , with the exception of conscripts , who comprised about one third of the membership , were denied many of the rights afforded to military veterans .",

  "/wiki/Mauser_C96": "The Mauser C96 ( Construktion 96 ) is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by German arms manufacturer Mauser from 1896 to 1937 . Unlicensed copies of the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the 20th century . The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger , the long barrel , the wooden shoulder stock which gives it the stability of a short-barreled rifle and doubles as a holster or carrying case , and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom . The grip earned the gun the nickname broomhandle in the English-speaking world , because of its round wooden handle , and in China the C96 was nicknamed the box cannon ( Chinese : \u76d2\u5b50\u70ae ; pinyin : h\u00e9zip\u00e0o ) because of its rectangular internal magazine and the fact that it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock . With its long barrel and high-velocity cartridge , the Mauser C96 had superior range and better penetration than most other pistols of its era ; the 7.63\u00d725mm Mauser cartridge was the highest-velocity commercially manufactured pistol cartridge until the advent of the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935 . Mauser manufactured approximately 1 million C96 pistols , while the number produced in Spain and China was large but unknown due to the non-existence or poor preservation of production records from those countries .",

Also known as the Volksmaschinenpistole ( people 's machine pistol ) , the weapon was closely based on the Sten Mk II submachine gun , except for its vertical magazine ; some had additional pistol grips . The MP 3008 was an emergency measure , designed at a time when Germany was at the point of collapse . Desperately short of raw materials , the Germans sought to produce a radically cheaper alternative to their standard submachine gun , the MP 40 . The MP 3008 was a simple blowback design operating from an open bolt . It was crudely manufactured in small machine shops and variations were common . Typically , the magazine was bottom-mounted unlike the side-mounted Sten . Initially all steel without handgrips , the wire buttstock was welded to the frame and was typically triangular , however the design changed as conditions inside Germany worsened and on final guns wooden stocks and other variations are found . The Ger\u00e4t Potsdam , another version of the Sten Mk II produced by Mauser in 1944 , was an exact copy of the original Sten , right down to its manufacturing stamps in an effort to conceal its origin for clandestine operations . About 28,000 were claimed to have been produced , but postwar interrogations of highly ranked Mauser personnel failed to provide proof that any more than 10,000 units had been made .",

  "/wiki/Suomi_KP/-31": "The Suomi KP/-31 ( Suomi-konepistooli or Finland-submachine gun , literally : Finland Machine-pistol ) is a submachine gun ( SMG ) of Finnish design that was mainly used during World War II . It is a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model , which was revealed to the public in 1925 . The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP . The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II . It also had a profound effect on that conflict beyond Finland as the Soviet authorities , who had been dismissive of submachine guns , were persuaded of their deadly efficiency by the Finns after attacking them in 1939 . Its 71-round drum magazine was later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 . Though a relatively early design , the Suomi was a formidable weapon : highly controllable and with accuracy superior to that of the mass-produced PPSh-41 thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel , with the same exceptionally high rate of fire and an equally large magazine capacity . Its one major disadvantage was its high production cost , which led to the later introduction of the KP/-44 , a close copy of the Soviet PPS-43 but accepting the existing magazines and drums for the KP/-31 . The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy , founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti , Captain V. Korpela , Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof . The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti .",
