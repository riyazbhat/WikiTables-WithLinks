  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/Helicopter": "A helicopter , or chopper , is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors . This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically , to hover , and to fly forward , backward , and laterally . These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL ( Vertical TakeOff and Landing ) aircraft can not perform . The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861 , which originates from the Greek helix ( \u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) helix , spiral , whirl , convolution and pteron ( \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ) wing . English language nicknames for helicopter include chopper , copter , helo , heli , and whirlybird . Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight , with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936 . Some helicopters reached limited production , but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production , with 131 aircraft built . Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor , it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration . Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity . Coaxial helicopters , tiltrotor aircraft , and compound helicopters are all flying today . Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France , and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones .",
