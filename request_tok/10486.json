  "/wiki/ZX_Spectrum": "The ZX Spectrum ( UK : /z\u025bd \u025bks/ ) is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research . Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82 , it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine 's colour display , compared with the black and white display of its predecessor , the ZX81 . The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . The Spectrum was among the first mainstream-audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen . Some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry . The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric-1 , Oric Atmos , BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s . While the machine was officially discontinued in 1992 , new software titles continue to be released - over 40 were released in 2019 .",

  "/wiki/Text_adventure": "Interactive fiction , often abbreviated IF , is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment . Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives , either in the form of interactive narratives or interactive narrations . These works can also be understood as a form of video game , either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game . In common usage , the term refers to text adventures , a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be text-only , however , graphical text adventure games , where the text is accompanied by graphics ( still images , animations or video ) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text . Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction , known as Puzzle-free , that focuses on narrative , and text adventures that focus on puzzles . Due to their text-only nature , they sidestepped the problem of writing for widely divergent graphics architectures . This feature meant that interactive fiction games were easily ported across all the popular platforms at the time , including CP/M ( not known for gaming or strong graphics capabilities ) . The number of interactive fiction works is increasing steadily as new ones are produced by an online community , using freely available development systems . The term can also be used to refer to digital versions of literary works that are not read in a linear fashion , known as gamebooks , where the reader is instead given choices at different points in the text ; these decisions determine the flow and outcome of the story . The most famous example of this form of printed fiction is the Choose Your Own Adventure book series , and the collaborative addventure format has also been described as a form of interactive fiction . The term interactive fiction is sometimes used also to refer to visual novels , a type of interactive narrative software popular in Japan .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30 % and 40 % share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

  "/wiki/Turn-based_tactics": "Turn-based tactics ( TBT ) , or tactical turn-based ( TTB ) , is a computer and video game genre of strategy video games that through stop-action simulates the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics in generally small-scale confrontations as opposed to more strategic considerations of turn-based strategy ( TBS ) games . Turn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them , and usually by the provision of a realistic ( or at least believable ) representation of military tactics and operations .",
  "/wiki/Role-playing_video_game": "A role-playing video game ( commonly referred to as simply a role-playing game or an RPG as well as a computer role-playing game or a CRPG ) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character ( and/or several party members ) immersed in some well-defined world . Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games ( including Dungeons & Dragons ) and use much of the same terminology , settings and game mechanics . Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements , player character development , complexity , as well as replay value and immersion . The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed . RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences .",

  "/wiki/Boardgame": "A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or board , according to a set of rules . Some games are based on pure strategy , but many contain an element of chance ; and some are purely chance , with no element of skill . Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve . Early board games represented a battle between two armies , and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters , winning position , or accrual of points . There are many varieties of board games . Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme , like checkers , to having a specific theme and narrative , like Cluedo . Rules can range from the very simple , like Tic-tac-toe , to those describing a game universe in great detail , like Dungeons & Dragons - although most of the latter are role-playing games where the board is secondary to the game , serving to help visualize the game scenario . The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game , but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules ; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets , but have great strategic depth .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/IOS": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",
  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format ."
