  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity , identified by traits such as a name , organization , leadership and doctrine . The Roman Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , and Oriental Orthodoxy , meaning the large majority , all self-describe as churches , whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or fellowships . Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine ; issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , ecclesiology , eschatology , and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another . Groups of denominations - often sharing broadly similar beliefs , practices , and historical ties - are sometimes known as branches of Christianity . These branches differ in many ways , especially through differences in practices and belief . Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another . Several groups claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD . Others , however , believe in denominationalism , where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels , beliefs , and practices . Because of this concept , some Christian bodies reject the term denomination to describe themselves , to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations . The Roman Catholic Church , which has over 1.3 billion members - slightly over half of all Christians worldwide - does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church , a view rejected by other Christians . Protestant denominations account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide . Together , Catholicism and Protestantism ( including Anglicanism , and other denominations sharing historical ties ) comprise Western Christianity .",

  "/wiki/Bolton,_Greater_Manchester": "Bolton ( /\u02c8b\u0252lt\u0259n/ ( listen ) , locally /\u02c8bo\u028at\u0259n/ ) is a town in Greater Manchester in North West England . A former mill town , Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century , introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition . The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown , and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world . The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War , and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton . Close to the West Pennine Moors , Bolton is 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest of Manchester . It is surrounded by several smaller towns and villages that together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton , of which Bolton is the administrative centre . The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403 , whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400 . Historically part of Lancashire , Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors . In the English Civil War , the town was a Parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly Royalist region , and as a result was stormed by 3,000 Royalist troops led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1644 . In what became known as the Bolton Massacre , 1,600 residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner . Bolton Wanderers football club play home games at the University of Bolton Stadium and the WBA World light-welterweight champion Amir Khan was born in the town .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England .

It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/The_New_Church": "The New Church ( or Swedenborgianism ) is the name for several historically related Christian denominations that developed as a new religious group , influenced by the writings of scientist and Swedish Lutheran theologian Emanuel Swedenborg ( 1688-1772 ) . According to Swedenborg , he received a new revelation from Christ in visions he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years . He predicted in his writings that God would replace the traditional Christian Church , establishing a New Church that would worship Jesus Christ as God . According to New Church doctrine , each person must cooperate in repentance , reformation , and regeneration . The movement was founded on the belief that God explained the spiritual meaning of the Bible to Swedenborg to reveal the truth of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . Swedenborg cited divine revelation for his writings , and his followers believe that he witnessed the Last Judgment in the spiritual world with the inauguration of the New Church . The church is seen by its members as what Jesus is establishing with those who believe that he is the one God of heaven and Earth , with obedience to Jesus 's commandments being necessary for salvation . It is thought that any Christian holding these beliefs is part of the New Church . New Church organizations acknowledge what they believe to be the universal nature of Jesus 's church : all who do good in accordance with the truth of their religion will be accepted by Jesus into heaven ( since God is goodness itself ) , and doing good joins one with God . Adherents believe that New Church doctrine is derived from the Bible and provides enlightenment of the truth ; this leads to diminished doubt , a recognition of personal faults , and a more-focused , happier life . Other names for the movement include Swedenborgian , New Christians , Neo-Christians , Church of the New Jerusalem , and The Lord 's New Church . Although those outside the church may refer to the movement as Swedenborgianism , some adherents distance themselves from this title ( which implies following Swedenborg , rather than Jesus ) ."
