Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp , it is the first installment in the Spider-Man trilogy , and stars Tobey Maguire as the title character , alongside Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst , James Franco , Cliff Robertson , and Rosemary Harris . The film centers on an outcast teen genius named Peter Parker , who develops spider-like superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider . After his foster father/uncle is murdered by an armed felon , something of which he felt partially responsible , a guilt-ridden Parker is later driven to use his new abilities for a nobler purpose , as the hero/vigilante Spider-Man , to atone for his uncle 's murder . The rest of the film focuses on Parker 's efforts to balance his personal life as he graduates from high school and becomes a freelance photographer , while also struggling with his studies , his friendship with his childhood best friend Harry Osborn , his growing feelings for his former high school crush Mary Jane Watson , and his dual life as Spider-Man . After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years , it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films , Carolco , and New Cannon . Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition ( a different screenplay was written by James Cameron , Ted Newsom , John Brancato , Barney Cohen , and Joseph Goldman ) , Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay ( credited as Cameron 's ) , and Koepp received sole credit in final billing . Directors Roland Emmerich , Ang Lee , Chris Columbus , Jan de Bont , M. Night Shyamalan , Tony Scott , and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000 . The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production . Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January 8 to June 30 , 2001 . Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film 's visual effects . Spider-Man premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29 , 2002 , and was released in the United States four days later on May 3 .",
