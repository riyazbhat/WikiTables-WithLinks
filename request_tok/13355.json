It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death and burial and the discovery of the empty tomb - there is no genealogy of Jesus or birth narrative , nor , in the original ending at chapter 16 , any post-resurrection appearances of Jesus . It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action , an exorcist , a healer , and a miracle worker . Jesus is also the Son of God , but he keeps his identity secret ( the Messianic Secret ) , concealing it in parables so that even most of the disciples fail to understand . All this is in keeping with prophecy , which foretold the fate of the messiah as suffering servant . The gospel ends , in its original version , with the discovery of the empty tomb , a promise to meet again in Galilee , and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the resurrection . Mark probably dates from AD 66-70 . Most scholars reject the tradition which ascribes it to John Mark , the companion of the apostle Peter , and regard it ( and the other gospels ) as anonymous , the work of an unknown author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories , controversy stories , parables , and a passion narrative . It was traditionally placed second , and sometimes fourth , in the Christian canon , as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel , Matthew . The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew , secondarily from John , and only distantly from Mark . It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels , and as a source used by both Matthew and Luke . The hypothesis of Marcan priority ( that Mark was written first ) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today , and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God .",

All four were anonymous ( the modern names were added in the 2nd century ) , almost certainly none were by eyewitnesses , and all are the end-products of long oral and written transmission , They are a subset of the genre of ancient biography but ancient biographies should not be confused with modern ones , and often included propaganda and kerygma ( preaching ) ; yet while there is no guarantee that the events which they describe are historically accurate , in the quest for the historical Jesus scholars believe that it is possible to differentiate Jesus ' own views from those of his later followers . Many non-canonical gospels were also written , all later than the four canonical gospels , and like them advocating the particular theological views of their various authors .",

  "/wiki/Atticism": "Atticism ( meaning favouring Attica , the region of Athens in Greece ) was a rhetorical movement that began in the first quarter of the 1st century BC ; it may also refer to the wordings and phrasings typical of this movement , in contrast with various contemporary forms of Koine Greek ( both literary and vulgar ) , which continued to evolve in directions guided by the common usages of Hellenistic Greek . Atticism was portrayed as a return to Classical methods after what was perceived as the pretentious style of the Hellenistic , Sophist rhetoric and called for a return to the approaches of the Attic orators . Although the plainer language of Atticism eventually became as belabored and ornate as the perorations it sought to replace , its original simplicity meant that it remained universally comprehensible throughout the Greek world . This helped maintain vital cultural links across the Mediterranean and beyond . Admired and popularly imitated writers such as Lucian also adopted Atticism , so that the style survived until the Renaissance , when it was taken up by non-Greek students of Byzantine expatriates . Renaissance scholarship , the basis of modern scholarship in the west , nurtured strong Classical and Attic views , continuing Atticism for another four centuries . Represented at its height by rhetoricians such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus , and grammarians such as Herodian and Phrynichus Arabius at Alexandria , this tendency prevailed from the 1st century BC onward , and with the force of an ecclesiastical dogma controlled all subsequent Greek culture , even so that the living form of the Greek language , even then being transformed into modern Greek much later , was quite obscured and only occasionally found expression , chiefly in private documents , though also in popular literature . For instance , there were literary writers such as Strabo , Plutarch , and Josephus who intentionally withdrew from this way of expression ( classical Greek ) in favor of the common form of Greek . In painting , the so-called Parisian Atticism is a particular movemement in French painting of the 17th century , spanning approximatively between 1640 and 1660 , when famous painters working in Paris like Eustache Le Sueur or Jacques Stella elaborated a rigorous classicist style , characterized by a research of sobriety , luminosity and harmony and references to the Greco-Roman world .",

  "/wiki/Congregationalist": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",

  "/wiki/Liberation_theology": "Liberation theology is a synthesis of Christian theology and socio-economic analyses , based in far-left politics , particularly Marxism , that emphasizes social concern for the poor and political liberation for oppressed peoples . In the 1950s and the 1960s , liberation theology was the political praxis of Latin American theologians , such as Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez of Peru , Leonardo Boff of Brazil , Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay , and Jon Sobrino of Spain , who popularized the phrase Preferential option for the poor . The Latin American context also produced evangelical advocates of liberation theology , such as C. Ren\u00e9 Padilla of Ecuador , Samuel Escobar of Peru , and Orlando E. Costas of Puerto Rico , who , in the 1970s , called for integral mission , emphasizing evangelism and social responsibility . Theologies of liberation have developed in other parts of the world such as black theology in the United States and South Africa , Palestinian liberation theology , Dalit theology in India , and Minjung theology in South Korea .",
  "/wiki/William_Blake": "William Blake ( 28 November 1757 - 12 August 1827 ) was an English poet , painter , and printmaker . Largely unrecognised during his lifetime , Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age . What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language . His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced . In 2002 , Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC 's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons . While he lived in London his entire life , except for three years spent in Felpham , he produced a diverse and symbolically rich \u0153uvre , which embraced the imagination as the body of God or human existence itself . Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views , he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity , and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work . His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as Pre-Romantic . A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England ( indeed , to almost all forms of organised religion ) , Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American Revolutions . Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs , he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine ; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg . Despite these known influences , the singularity of Blake 's work makes him difficult to classify . The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a glorious luminary , and a man not forestalled by predecessors , nor to be classed with contemporaries , nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors .",
  "/wiki/Book_of_Revelation": "The Book of Revelation , often called the Book of Revelations , Revelation to John , Apocalypse of John , The Revelation , or simply Revelation , the Revelation from Jesus Christ ( from its opening words ) or the Apocalypse , is the final book of the New Testament , and therefore also the final book of the Christian Bible . Its title is derived from the first word of the text , written in Koine Greek : apokalypsis , meaning unveiling or revelation ( before title pages and titles , books were commonly known by the incipit , their first words , as is also the case of the Hebrew Five Books of Moses or Torah ) . The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament canon ( although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in the Gospels and the Epistles ) . The only extended apocalyptic passage in the Old Testament is in the Book of Daniel . [ a ] Thus , it occupies a central place in Christian eschatology . The author names himself in the text as John , but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate . Second-century Christian writers such as Justin Martyr , Irenaeus , Melito the bishop of Sardis , and Clement of Alexandria and the author of the Muratorian fragment identify John the Apostle as the John of Revelation . Modern scholarship generally takes a different view , and many consider that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet . Some modern scholars characterise Revelation 's author as a putative figure whom they call John of Patmos . The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian ( AD 81-96 ) , and the evidence tends to confirm this . The book spans three literary genres : the epistolary , the apocalyptic , and the prophetic . It begins with John , on the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea , addressing a letter to the Seven Churches of Asia .",
