It was established as a national park in 1954 and disestablished as such in 2014 , when it was replaced by a legal entity named Te Urewera . It was the largest of four national parks in the North Island . Covering an area of approximately 2,127 km\u00b2 , it was in the north of the Hawke 's Bay region of the North Island . SH38 is the only road that leads through the park . The road is unsealed over 74 km . On 28 July 1954 , the catchment areas of Lake Waikaremoana , Lake Waikareiti and other Crown reserves were gazetted as a national park , and by 1957 proposals were well underway to add the rest of the Crown land in Te Urewera north of Ruatahuna . This proposal was formalised in November 1957 when an additional 1,350 km\u00b2 were added . Further additions were made in 1962 , 1975 and 1979 , with smaller acquisitions and boundary alterations in the intervening period . The lake bed and M\u0101ori enclaves were not included in the park gazetting . The Crown had leased the lake bed , which was managed by the Department of Conservation . Te Urewera is the traditional home of the Tuhoe people .",

  "/wiki/Protected_area": "Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural , ecological or cultural values . There are several kinds of protected areas , which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organizations involved . The term protected area also includes marine protected areas , the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean , and transboundary protected areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes . There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world ( as of October 2010 ) with more added daily , representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world 's land surface area . As of 2016 , there are 14,688 Marine Protected Areas ( MPAs ) , and approximately 14.7% of the world 's terrestrial and inland water areas ( excluding Antartica ) are protected . For waters under national jurisdiction beyond inland waters , approximately 10.2% of coastal and marine areas and 4.12% of global ocean areas are covered by marine protected areas . In contrast , only 0.25% of the world 's oceans beyond national jurisdiction are covered by MPAs .

It takes its name from an ancestral figure , T\u016bhoe-p\u014dtiki . T\u016bhoe is a M\u0101ori-language word meaning steep or high noon . T\u016bhoe people also bear the sobriquet Nga Tamariki o te Kohu ( the children of the mist ) . T\u016bhoe traditional land is at Te Urewera ( Te Urewera National Park ) in the eastern North Island , a steep , heavily forested area which includes Lake Waikaremoana . T\u016bhoe traditionally relied on the forest for their needs . The tribe had its main centres of population in the small mountain valleys of Ahikereru and Ruatahuna , with Maungapohatu , the inner sanctum of the Urewera , as their sacred mountain . The T\u016bhoe country had a great reputation among the neighbouring tribes as a graveyard for invading forces .

  "/wiki/Iwi": "Iwi ( M\u0101ori pronunciation : [ \u02c8iwi ] ) are the largest social units in Aotearoa ( New Zealand ) M\u0101ori society . The M\u0101ori-language word iwi means people or nation , and is often translated as tribe , or a confederation of tribes . The word is both singular and plural in M\u0101ori . Iwi groups trace their ancestry to the original Polynesian migrants who , according to tradition , arrived from Hawaiki . Some iwi cluster into larger groupings that are based on whakapapa ( genealogical tradition ) and known as waka ( literally canoes , with reference to the original migration voyages ) . These super-groupings generally serve symbolic rather than practical functions . In pre-European times , most M\u0101ori were allied to relatively small groups in the form of hap\u016b ( sub-tribes ) and wh\u0101nau ( family ) . Each iwi contains a number of hap\u016b ; among the hap\u016b of the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua iwi , for example , are Te Uri-o-Hau , Te Roroa , Te Tao\u016b , and Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua-o-\u014cr\u0101kei . In modern-day New Zealand , iwi can exercise significant political power in the recovery and management of land and of other assets . ( Note for example the 1997 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the New Zealand Government and Ng\u0101i Tahu , compensating that iwi for various losses of the rights guaranteed under the Treaty of Waitangi of 1840 . ) Iwi affairs can have a real impact on New Zealand politics and society .

His birth name was Pataatai but he assumed the name Horonuku - meaning landslide - after the death of his parents in a landslide in 1846 . He was placed under house arrest by the Crown and forced to gift the mountains of Ruapehu , Tongariro and Ngauruhoe in 1887 for the creation of Tongariro National Park . Horonuku 's father , Mananui ( Tukino II ) , was a famous warrior who led the tribe successfully in many wars . Mananui stood well over two metres tall and was heavily built , and was not only a formidable warrior but also a fine military tactician . He was succeeded after his death in a landslide by his son Horonuku , however , because he was at such a young age of 16 they had his brother mind the iwi , Iwikau ( Tukino III ) , also a famous fighting chief . When Iwikau died in 1862 Horonuku succeeded his uncle as paramount chief . Although Horonuku was not renowned as a warrior he was an intelligent and far-sighted statesman who did the best for his people . During the 1860s Tuwharetoa lands in the central North Island were leased to European settlers farming sheep , but a decade later the Tuwharetoa were worried that the mountains were to be surveyed and that Europeans would break traditional tapu . Horonuku , having discussed the subject with other chiefs of his tribe , put a proposition to the government - that the land be bequeathed to the nation as a national park , on the condition that the government should remove from the mountains the remains of their famous predecessors , including Mananui , and erect a suitable tomb . The government agreed and the deed was signed by John Ballance as Native Minister and Horonuku , in 1887 . Horonuku 's sons included Tureiti Te Heuheu Tukino V .",

  "/wiki/Volcano": "A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object , such as Earth , that allows hot lava , volcanic ash , and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface . Earth 's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major , rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter , softer layer in its mantle . Therefore , on Earth , volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging , and most are found underwater . For example , a mid-oceanic ridge , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates . Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust 's plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America . This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of plate hypothesis volcanism . Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called hotspots , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core-mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth . Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .",

  "/wiki/Southern_Alps": "The Southern Alps / K\u0101 Tiritiri o te Moana is a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand 's South Island , reaching its greatest elevations near the range 's western side . The name Southern Alps generally refers to the entire range , although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it . The range includes the South Island 's Main Divide , which separates the water catchments of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island from those on the west coast . Politically , the Main Divide forms the boundary between the Marlborough , Canterbury and Otago regions to the southeast and the Tasman and West Coast regions to the northwest .",
  "/wiki/Westland_Tai_Poutini_National_Park": "Westland Tai Poutini National Park is located on the western coast of New Zealand 's South Island . Established in 1960 , the centenary of the European settlement of Westland District , it covers 1,320 km\u00b2 , and extends from the highest peaks of the Southern Alps to a wild and remote coastline . It borders the Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park along the Main Divide . Included in the park are glaciers , scenic lakes , and dense temperate rainforest , as well as remains of old gold mining towns along the coast . Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier are two popular tourist attractions within Westland Tai Poutini National Park . The park offers hunting opportunities for red deer , chamois , and tahr , while helicopters allow hunters to access the rugged , mountainous areas . The popular Copland Track runs upstream from the Karangarua River bridge . Along with the mountain scenery visible from the track , there are hot springs at Welcome Flat Hut . In 2010 , over 4,400 ha were added to the Westland Tai Poutini National Park , consisting of a number of areas scattered throughout the park , the majority being to the east of Okarito Lagoon .",
  "/wiki/Glacier": "A glacier ( US : /\u02c8\u0261le\u026a\u0283\u0259r/ or UK : /\u02c8\u0261l\u00e6si\u0259r , \u02c8\u0261le\u026asi\u0259r/ ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight . A glacier forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation ( melting and sublimation ) over many years , often centuries . Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating crevasses , seracs , and other distinguishing features . They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines . Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water . On Earth , 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets ( also known as continental glaciers ) in the polar regions , but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent including Oceania 's high-latitude oceanic island countries such as New Zealand . Between 35\u00b0N and 35\u00b0S , glaciers occur only in the Himalayas , Andes , Rocky Mountains , a few high mountains in East Africa , Mexico , New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran . Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth 's land surface . Continental glaciers cover nearly 13 million km2 ( 5 million sq mi ) or about 98 percent of Antarctica 's 13.2 million km2 ( 5.1 million sq mi ) , with an average thickness of 2,100 m ( 7,000 ft ) . Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers . The volume of glaciers , not including the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland , has been estimated as 170,000 km3 . Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth .",
  "/wiki/Rainforest": "Rainforests are forests characterized by high and continuous rainfall , with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between 2.5 and 4.5 metres ( 98 and 177 in ) and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests . The monsoon trough , alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone , plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth 's tropical rainforests : which are distinct from monsoonal areas of seasonal tropical forest . Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests . There may be many millions of species of plants , insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests . Tropical rainforests have been called the jewels of the Earth and the world 's largest pharmacy , because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there . Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world 's oxygen turnover , sometimes misnamed oxygen production , processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration . The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level . If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned , the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense , tangled growth of vines , shrubs and small trees , called a jungle . The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally . Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation , the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Mountaineering": "Mountaineering is the set of activities that involves ascending mountains . Mountaineering-related activities include traditional outdoor climbing , skiing , and traversing via ferratas . Indoor climbing , sport climbing and bouldering are also considered mountaineering by some . Unlike most sports , mountaineering lacks widely-applied formal rules , regulations , and governance ; mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing mountains . Numerous local alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities . A federation of alpine clubs , the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation ( UIAA ) , is the International Olympic Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing .",
  "/wiki/Ski_touring": "Ski touring is skiing in the backcountry on unmarked or unpatrolled areas . Touring is typically done off-piste and outside of ski resorts , and may extend over a period of more than one day . It is similar to backcountry skiing . Ski touring combines elements of Nordic and alpine skiing and embraces such sub-disciplines as Telemark and randonn\u00e9e . A defining characteristic is that the skier 's heels are free - i.e . not bound to the skis - in order to allow a natural gliding motion while traversing and ascending terrain which may range from perfectly flat to extremely steep . Ski touring has been adopted by skiers seeking new snow , by alpinists , and by those wishing to avoid the high costs of traditional alpine skiing at resorts . Touring requires independent navigation skills and may involve route-finding through potential avalanche terrain . It has parallels with hiking and wilderness backpacking . Ski mountaineering is a form of ski touring which variously combines the sports of Telemark , alpine , and backcountry skiing with that of mountaineering .",
