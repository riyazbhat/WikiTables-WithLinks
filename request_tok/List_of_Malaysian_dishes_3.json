The state is bordered by Negeri Sembilan to the north and west and Johor to the south . The exclave of Cape Rachado also borders Negeri Sembilan to the north . Its capital is Malacca City , which is 148 kilometres ( 92 miles ) southeast of Malaysia 's capital city Kuala Lumpur , 235 kilometres ( 146 miles ) northwest of Johor 's largest city Johor Bahru , and 95 km ( 59 miles ) northwest of Johor 's second largest city , Batu Pahat .

The head of state is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri or Governor , rather than a Sultan . Melaka is famous for its unique history and is one of the major tourist destinations in Malaysia . With a highly strategic state position for international trade routes , Malacca was once a well-known international trade center in the East . Many traders anchored in Malacca , especially traders from Arabia , China and India , traded at the port of Malacca and from there were born many of the descendants and tribes that exist in Malacca to this day . The harmonious life and ambience of the people of Malacca is attributed to the life of various races and ethnicities that have long existed among the local community . Malays , Malaysian Chinese , Malaysian Indians , Baba Nyonya , Kristang , Chitty and Eurasians are important ethnic groups living in the State of Malacca up to the present day",
  "/wiki/Snack": "A snack is a small service of food and generally eaten between meals .

  "/wiki/Egg": "The egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops until it can survive on its own , at which point the animal hatches . An egg results from fertilization of an egg cell . Most arthropods , vertebrates ( excluding mammals ) , and mollusks lay eggs , although some , such as scorpions , do not . Reptile eggs , bird eggs , and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell , either flexible or inflexible . Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows . When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches , i.e. , breaks out of the egg 's shell . Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack , pip , or break the eggshell or covering . The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 9 cm ( 11.8 in \u00d7 5.5 in \u00d7 3.5 in ) in size . Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother .

The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg , which weighs half of a gram ( around 0.02 oz ) . Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish , amphibians , insects , and other invertebrates can be even smaller",
  "/wiki/Brown_sugar": "Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses . It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content ( natural brown sugar ) , or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar ( commercial brown sugar ) . The Codex Alimentarius requires brown sugar to contain at least 88 % of sucrose plus invert sugar . Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5 % molasses ( light brown sugar ) to 6.5 % molasses ( dark brown sugar ) based on total volume . Based on total weight , regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10 % molasses . The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labelled as soft . The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling . The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products . Particle size is variable but generally less than granulated white sugar . Products for industrial use ( e.g. , the industrial production of cakes ) may be based on caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm"
