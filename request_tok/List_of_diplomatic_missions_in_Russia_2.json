  "/wiki/Vietnam": "Vietnam ( Vietnamese : Vi\u1ec7t Nam pronounced [ v\u00ee\u0259t n\u0101\u02d0m ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( Vietnamese : C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a x\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) , is the easternmost country on the Southeast Asian Indochinese Peninsula . With an estimated 95.5 million inhabitants as of 2018 [ update ] , it is the 15th most populous country in the world . Vietnam shares its land borders with China to the north , and Laos and Cambodia to the west . It shares its maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand , and the Philippines , Indonesia and Malaysia through the South China Sea . [ n 5 ] Its capital city is Hanoi , while its most populous city is Ho Chi Minh City , also known by its former name of Saigon . Archaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age . The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by China in the 2nd century BC , which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium . The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD . This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward until the Indochinese Peninsula saw French colonisation in the mid-19th century . Modern Vietnam was born upon the Proclamation of Independence from France in 1945 . Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the First Indochina War , which ended in 1954 , the nation was divided into two rival states : communist North and anti-communist South . Conflicts intensified in the Vietnam War , which saw extensive US intervention in support of South Vietnam and ended with North Vietnamese victory in 1975"
