  "/wiki/Supertall": "A skyscraper is a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m ( 492 ft ) . Historically , the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s . The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th century . Skyscrapers may host offices , residential spaces , and retail spaces . For buildings above a height of 300 m ( 984 ft ) , the term supertall skyscrapers can be used , while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m ( 1,969 ft ) are classified as megatall skyscrapers . One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls . These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above , rather than resting on load-bearing walls of conventional construction . Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls . However , skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows . Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure , and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist wind , seismic , and other lateral loads . To appear more slender , allow less wind exposure and transmit more daylight to the ground , many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks , which in some cases is also structurally required",
