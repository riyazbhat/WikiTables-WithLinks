  "/wiki/Alex_von_Falkenhausen_Motorenbau": "Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau ( AFM ) ( but some sources claim the M stood for Munich ) was a German racing car constructor . The team was started by Alexander von Falkenhausen , who was in the 1930s an important engineer in the development of BMW 's model 328 , along with Alfred Boning , Ernst Loof and Fritz Fiedler . The 328 was a dominant sports car in late 1930s Europe and winner of the 1940 Mille Miglia race in Brescia , Italy . After World War II , von Falkenhausen opened a garage in Munich where he tuned pre-war 328s , converting some of them into single-seaters , and in 1948 went on to build his own car marque with the 328 's engine . As a result , the Formula 2 AFM-1 appeared in 1949 , driven by Hans Stuck , resulting in a third place at the Grenzlandring . AFM won a heat in the Autodromo GP at Monza with Stuck behind the wheel , beating the Ferraris of Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio .

  "/wiki/BMW_in_Formula_One": "BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers ' Championship in 1950 . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s ( often under Formula Two regulations ) , before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s . This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race d\u00e9but in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright . The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009 , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team .
