  "/wiki/Flying_ace": "A flying ace , fighter ace or air ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat . The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an ace has varied , but is usually considered to be five or more . The concept of the ace emerged in 1915 during World War I , at the same time as aerial dogfighting . It was a propaganda term intended to provide the home front with a cult of the hero in what was otherwise a war of attrition . The individual actions of aces were widely reported and the image was disseminated of the ace as a chivalrous knight reminiscent of a bygone era . For a brief early period when air-to-air combat was just being invented , the exceptionally skilled pilot could shape the battle in the skies . For most of the war , however , the image of the ace had little to do with the reality of air warfare , in which fighters fought in formation and air superiority depended heavily on the relative availability of resources .",

Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies . Depending on the detachment size , the PAS is typically assisted by one to four assistant professors of aerospace studies ( APAS ) , also all active-duty USAF officers .
