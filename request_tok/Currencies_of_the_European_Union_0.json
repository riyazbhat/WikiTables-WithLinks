  "/wiki/Currency_peg": "A fixed exchange rate , sometimes called a pegged exchange rate , is a type of exchange rate regime in which a currency 's value is fixed or pegged by a monetary authority against the value of another currency , a basket of other currencies , or another measure of value , such as gold . There are benefits and risks to using a fixed exchange rate system . A fixed exchange rate is typically used to stabilize the exchange rate of a currency by directly fixing its value in a predetermined ratio to a different , more stable , or more internationally prevalent currency ( or currencies ) to which the currency is pegged . In doing so , the exchange rate between the currency and its peg does not change based on market conditions , unlike in a floating ( flexible ) exchange regime . This makes trade and investments between the two currency areas easier and more predictable and is especially useful for small economies that borrow primarily in foreign currency and in which external trade forms a large part of their GDP . A fixed exchange rate system can also be used to control the behavior of a currency , such as by limiting rates of inflation . However , in doing so , the pegged currency is then controlled by its reference value . As such , when the reference value rises or falls , it then follows that the value ( s ) of any currencies pegged to it will also rise and fall in relation to other currencies and commodities with which the pegged currency can be traded . In other words , a pegged currency is dependent on its reference value to dictate how its current worth is defined at any given time . In addition , according to the Mundell-Fleming model , with perfect capital mobility , a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic stability . In a fixed exchange rate system , a countrys central bank typically uses an open market mechanism and is committed at all times to buy and/or sell its currency at a fixed price in order to maintain its pegged ratio and , hence , the stable value of its currency in relation to the reference to which it is pegged . To maintain a desired exchange rate , the central bank during a time of private sector net demand for the foreign currency , sells foreign currency from its reserves and buys back the domestic money",

The euro , which is divided into 100 cents , is the second-largest and second-most traded currency in the foreign exchange market after the United States dollar . The currency is also used officially by the institutions of the European Union , by four European microstates that are not EU members , as well as unilaterally by Montenegro and Kosovo . Outside Europe , a number of special territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency . Additionally , over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro . The euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar . As of December 2019 [ update ] , with more than \u20ac1.3 trillion in circulation , the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world . The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid . The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999 , replacing the former European Currency Unit ( ECU ) at a ratio of 1:1 ( US $ 1.1743 ) . Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002 , making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members , and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies . While the euro dropped subsequently to US $ 0.83 within two years ( 26 October 2000 ) , it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002 , peaking at US $ 1.60 on 18 July 2008",

Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally , but these countries do not officially form part of the eurozone and do not have representation in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) or in the Eurogroup . The ECB , which is governed by a president and a board of the heads of national central banks , sets the monetary policy of the zone . The principal task of the ECB is to keep inflation under control .

While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne .

As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18 % of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile .

Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 .

The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix .

Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation .

Its capital , Luxembourg City , is one of the four official capitals of the European Union ( together with Brussels , Frankfurt , and Strasbourg ) and the seat of the European Court of Justice , the highest judicial authority in the EU . Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish . The repeated invasions by Germany , especially in World War II , resulted in the country 's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and , among other things , led to the foundation of the European Union . With an area of 2,586 square kilometres ( 998 sq mi ) , it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe .

The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital",

  "/wiki/Floating_currency": "A floating exchange rate ( also called a fluctuating or flexible exchange rate ) is a type of exchange rate regime in which a currency 's value is allowed to fluctuate in response to foreign exchange market events . A currency that uses a floating exchange rate is known as a floating currency . A floating currency is contrasted with a fixed currency whose value is tied to that of another currency , material goods or to a currency basket . In the modern world , most of the world 's currencies are floating , and include the most widely-traded currencies : the United States dollar , the Swiss franc , the Indian rupee , the euro , the Japanese yen , the pound sterling , and the Australian dollar . However , even with floating currencies , central banks often participate in the markets to attempt to influence the value of floating exchange rates . The Canadian dollar most closely resembles a pure floating currency because the Canadian central bank has not interfered with its price since it officially stopped doing so in 1998 . The US dollar runs a close second , with very little change in its foreign reserves . In contrast , Japan and the UK intervene to a greater extent , and India has seen medium-range intervention by its central bank , the Reserve Bank of India . [ citation needed ] From 1946 to the early 1970s , the Bretton Woods system made fixed currencies the norm ; however , in 1971 , the US decided no longer to uphold the dollar exchange at 1/35th of an ounce of gold and so its currency was no longer fixed . After the collapse of the Smithsonian Agreement in 1973 most of the world 's currencies followed suit . However , some countries , such as most of the Gulf States , fixed their currency to the value of another currency , which has been more recently associated with slower rates of growth . When a currency floats , targets other than the exchange rate itself are used to administer monetary policy ( see open-market operations )",

It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71 % of its territory , 58 % of its population , and 32 % of ethnic Hungarians",

It is subdivided into 100 groszy ( gr ) . [ a ] The widely recognised English form of the currency is the Polish zloty . It is the most traded currency in Central Europe and ranks 22nd in the foreign exchange market . The word z\u0142oty is a masculine form of the Polish adjective 'golden ' , which closely relates with its name to the Dutch guilder , whereas the grosz subunit was based on Austrian groschen . It was officially introduced to replace its predecessor , the Polish marka , on 28 February 1919 and began circulation in 1924 . The only body permitted to manufacture or mint z\u0142oty coins is Mennica Polska , founded in Warsaw on 10 February 1766 . As a result of inflation in the early 1990s , the currency underwent redenomination . Thus , on 1 January 1995 , 10,000 old z\u0142otych ( PLZ ) became one new z\u0142oty ( PLN ) . Since then , the currency has been relatively stable , with an exchange rate fluctuating between 3 and 4 z\u0142oty for a United States dollar . Though Poland is a member of the European Union , nearly 60 % of Poles are strongly against adopting the euro as a new currency",
