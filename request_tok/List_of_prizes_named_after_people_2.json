The Honor was introduced in 1971 , but some runners-up had been identified annually and all those runners-up were retroactively named Caldecott Honor Books . The number of Honors or runners-up had always been one to five , and it had been two to four since 1994 , until five were named in 2013 and six in 2015 . The Honor Books must be a subset of the runners-up on the final ballot , either the leading runners-up on that ballot or the leaders on one further ballot that excludes the winner .",

  "/wiki/Picture_book": "A picture book combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format , most often aimed at young children . With the narrative told primarily through text , they are distinct from comics , which do so primarily through sequential images . The images in picture books are commonly produced in a range of media , such as oil paints , acrylics , watercolor , and pencil , among others . Two of the earliest works in the format of modern picture books are Heinrich Hoffmann 's Struwwelpeter from 1845 and Beatrix Potter 's The Tale of Peter Rabbit from 1902 . Some of the best-known picture books are Robert McCloskey 's Make Way for Ducklings , Dr. Seuss ' The Cat In The Hat , and Maurice Sendak 's Where the Wild Things Are . The Caldecott Medal ( established 1938 ) and Kate Greenaway Medal ( established 1955 ) are awarded annually for illustrations in children 's literature .

Because the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography , geographical references were removed . The conferences and divisions were re-aligned in 1981 to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams , but the existing names were retained with the Campbell Conference becoming the conference for the NHL 's westernmost teams . The names of conferences and divisions were changed in 1993 to reflect their geographic locations .

His novel Don Quixote has been translated into over 140 languages and dialects ; it is , after the Bible , the most-translated book in the world . Don Quixote , a classic of Western literature , is sometimes considered both the first modern novel and the best work of fiction ever written .

He has also been dubbed El pr\u00edncipe de los ingenios ( The Prince of Wits ) . In 1569 , in forced exile from Castile , Cervantes moved to Rome , where he worked as chamber assistant of a cardinal . Then he enlisted as a soldier in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment and continued his military life until 1575 , when he was captured by Barbary pirates . After five years of captivity , he was released on payment of a ransom by his parents and the Trinitarians , a Catholic religious order , and he returned to his family in Madrid .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

He found his niche when promoted to bat at number three . Known as Chappelli , he earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen . Chappell 's blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators ; the issue of sledging first arose during his tenure as captain , and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s . John Arlott called him a cricketer of effect rather than the graces . An animated presence at the batting crease , he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing , and restlessly tapped his bat on the ground as the bowler ran in . Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons , Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect . He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid-on , but his trademark shot was the hook , famously saying three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me .

When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and , instead , play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side . Australia won the game by 5 wickets . ODIs were played in white coloured kits with a red coloured ball .

The award was created to honour Clive Churchill , one of the greatest rugby league players in Australian history , following his death in 1985 . A prestigious honour in the NRL , the medal 's recipient is chosen by the selectors of the Australian national team and announced and awarded to the player judged best and fairest on the ground at every post-grand final ceremony . The Clive Churchill Medal has been awarded ever since the 1986 NSWRL season when its first recipient was Parramatta 's Peter Sterling . It was initially presented in a case until 2000 where it is presented separately with a ribbon being worn around the neck . The only two players to have won the award more than once are Canberra 's Bradley Clyde ( 1989 and 1991 ) and Melbourne Storm 's Billy Slater ( 2009 and 2017 ) . In 2010 , the Melbourne Storm were stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships due to salary cap breaches exposed by the NRL , however the Clive Churchill Medallists from those years still continue to be recognised .

West Australian Football League , recognises the player ( s ) adjudged to have had the best performance in a game or over a season for a given sporting club or competition . The awards are sometimes dependent on not receiving a suspension for misconduct or breaching the rules during that season . In the Australian Football League ( formerly the VFL ) , the Brownlow Medal is awarded to the player who , provided he has not been suspended during the season , receives the most votes from the umpires for being the Fairest and Best player in games during the home and away season . In each game , the umpires award three votes to the player they judge to be the best afield in that game , two votes to the second-best player and one vote to the third-best player . The votes are counted at a gala function on the Monday preceding the Grand Final . The eligibility of suspended or reprimanded players due to minor offences to win the award has frequently been questioned . Another best and fairest honour , the Leigh Matthews Trophy , is voted on by the AFL 's players and awarded by their trade union , the AFL Players Association . Unlike the Brownlow , players who have served disciplinary suspensions during the season are still eligible to win this award . The oldest such award is the Magarey Medal , awarded to the Fairest and most brilliant player in the South Australian National Football League .

An 11-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion , he won seven Cy Young Awards during his career , more than any other pitcher in history . Clemens was known for his fierce competitive nature and hard-throwing pitching style , which he used to intimidate batters . Clemens debuted in the major leagues in 1984 with the Red Sox , whose pitching staff he anchored for 12 years . In 1986 , he won the American League ( AL ) Cy Young Award , the AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award , and the All-Star Game MVP Award , and he struck out an MLB-record 20 batters in a single game ( Clemens repeated the 20-strikeout feat 10 years later ) . After the 1996 season , Clemens left Boston via free agency and joined the Toronto Blue Jays . In each of his two seasons with Toronto , Clemens won a Cy Young Award , as well as the pitching triple crown by leading the league in wins , ERA , and strikeouts .

The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy .

The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis , Indiana . In its 2016-17 fiscal year the NCAA took in $ 1.06 billion in revenue , over 82% of which was generated by the Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament . In August 1973 , the current three-division system of Division I , Division II , and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention . Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA .

This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament .

  "/wiki/College_baseball": "College baseball is baseball that is played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education . In comparison to football and basketball , college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players , as baseball 's professional minor leagues are more extensive , with a greater history of supplying players to the top professional league . Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball . However , if players do opt to enroll at a four-year college to play baseball , they must complete three years to regain professional eligibility , unless they reach age 21 before starting their third year of college . Players who enroll at junior colleges ( i.e. , two-year institutions ) regain eligibility after one year at that level . In the most recently completed 2017 season , there were 298 NCAA Division I teams in the United States ( including schools transitioning from Division II to Division I ) .
