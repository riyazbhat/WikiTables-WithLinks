  "/wiki/Charles_Abbott,_1st_Baron_Tenterden": "Charles Abbott , 1st Baron Tenterden PC SL ( 7 October 1762 - 4 November 1832 ) , was a British barrister and judge who served as Lord Chief Justice of the King 's Bench between 1818 and 1832 . Born in obscure circumstances to a barber and his wife in Canterbury , Abbott was educated initially at a dame school before moving to The King 's School , Canterbury in 1769 . He was noted as an excellent student , receiving an exhibition scholarship from the school in March 1781 , when he matriculated at Corpus Christi College , Oxford . Here he was elected a fellow , and also served as a tutor to the son of Sir Francis Buller , which first made him consider becoming a barrister . He joined the Middle Temple in 1787 , transferring to the Inner Temple in 1793 , and was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1796 . Abbott was noted as an excellent barrister , earning more than any other during his time at the Bar , despite being considered unimaginitive and a poor speaker . He was offered a position as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1808 , which he turned down ; he accepted the same offer in 1816 , receiving the customary knighthood and being appointed a Serjeant-at-Law . Three months after he started sitting as a judge he was transferred to the Court of King 's Bench , where he was initially rather poor , being unfamiliar with the court 's business . Within two years he showed the highest judicial excellence , and when Lord Ellenborough had a stroke in 1818 , Abbott was chosen to replace him as Lord Chief Justice . His reign at the head of the Court of King 's Bench saw the court flourish , with strong justices and his own much-admired abilities . He was appointed to the peerage in 1827 , sitting as Charles Abbott , 1st Baron Tenterden , and initially attended the House of Lords regularly . His opposition to the Reform Act 1832 , which he claimed treated city corporations with absolute contempt , led to his refusal to attend the Lords .",

Founded in 1517 , it is the 12th oldest college in Oxford . The college , situated on Merton Street between Merton College and Christ Church , is one of the smallest in Oxford by student population , having around 250 undergraduates and 90 graduates . It is academic by Oxford standards , averaging in the top half of the university 's informal ranking system , the Norrington Table , in recent years , and coming second in 2009-10 . The college 's role in the translation of the King James Bible is historically significant . The college is also noted for the pillar sundial in the main quadrangle , known as the Pelican Sundial , which was erected in 1581 . Corpus achieved notability in more recent years by winning University Challenge on 9 May 2005 and once again on 23 February 2009 , although the latter win was later disqualified .

  "/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales": "The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales is the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales and the President of the Courts of England and Wales . Historically , the officeholder was the second-highest judge of the Courts of England and Wales , after the Lord Chancellor , but became the top judge as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 , which removed the judicial functions from the office of Lord Chancellor , altered the duties of the Lord Chief Justice and changed the relationship between the two offices . The Lord Chief Justice ordinarily serves as President of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal and Head of Criminal Justice , but under the 2005 Act can appoint another judge to these positions . The Lord Chief Justice 's equivalent in Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session , who also holds the post of Lord Justice-General in the High Court of Justiciary . There is also a Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland , successor to the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland of the pre-Partition era . For the entire United Kingdom judiciary , there is a President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , though that court does not have final jurisdiction over Scottish criminal law .

The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Cabinet and , by law , is responsible for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts . In 2007 , there were a number of changes to the legal system and to the office of the Lord Chancellor . Formerly , the Lord Chancellor was also the presiding officer of the House of Lords , the head of the judiciary in England and Wales and the presiding judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice , but the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 transferred these roles to the Lord Speaker , the Lord Chief Justice and the Chancellor of the High Court respectively . The current Lord Chancellor , as at January 2020 , is Robert Buckland , who is also Secretary of State for Justice . One of the Lord Chancellor 's responsibilities is to act as the custodian of the Great Seal of the Realm , kept historically in the Lord Chancellor 's Purse . A Lord Keeper of the Great Seal may be appointed instead of a Lord Chancellor . The two offices entail exactly the same duties ; the only distinction is in the mode of appointment . Furthermore , the office of Lord Chancellor may be exercised by a committee of individuals known as Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal , usually when there is a delay between an outgoing chancellor and their replacement .",

  "/wiki/Master_of_the_Rolls": "The Keeper or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England , known as the Master of the Rolls , is the President of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , Civil Division , and Head of Civil Justice . As a judge , he is the second in seniority in England and Wales only to the Lord Chief Justice . The position dates from at least 1286 , although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that . The Master of the Rolls was initially a clerk responsible for keeping the Rolls or records of the Court of Chancery , and was known as the Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery . The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks , and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm . The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did ; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520 . With the Judicature Act 1873 , which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts , the Master of the Rolls joined the Chancery Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal , but left the Chancery Division by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881 . The Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish converts , which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office . He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor . One residual reminder of this role is the fact that the Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve , ex officio , as President of the British Records Association . The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors , the officers of the Senior Courts . One of the most prominent people to hold the position was Thomas Cromwell , a highly influential figure during the reign of Henry VIII ; more recently , Lord Denning held the position for 20 years , from 1962 to 1982 , and made sweeping changes in the common law .",

An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced .

In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall , Oxford ( now Hertford College ) , intending to become a priest , but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate . On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln 's Inn , where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636 . As a barrister , Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War , including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud ; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial , and conceived the defence Charles used . Despite the Royalist loss , Hale 's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions , and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission , which investigated law reform . Following the Commission 's dissolution , Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas .

  "/wiki/William_Murray,_1st_Earl_of_Mansfield": "William Murray , 1st Earl of Mansfield , PC , SL ( 2 March 1705 - 20 March 1793 ) was a British barrister , politician and judge noted for his reform of English law . Born to Scottish nobility , he was educated in Perth , Scotland , before moving to London at the age of 13 to take up a place at Westminster School . He was accepted into Christ Church , Oxford , in May 1723 , and graduated four years later . Returning to London from Oxford , he was called to the Bar by Lincoln 's Inn on 23 November 1730 , and quickly gained a reputation as an excellent barrister . He became involved in politics in 1742 , beginning with his election as a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge , now in West Yorkshire , and appointment as Solicitor General . In the absence of a strong Attorney General , he became the main spokesman for the government in the House of Commons , and was noted for his great powers of eloquence and described as beyond comparison the best speaker in the House of Commons . With the promotion of Sir Dudley Ryder to Lord Chief Justice in 1754 , he became Attorney General , and when Ryder unexpectedly died several months later , he took his place as Chief Justice . As the most powerful British jurist of the century , Mansfield 's decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved the country onto the path to abolishing slavery . He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as world leader in industry , finance and trade . He modernised both English law and the English courts system ; he speeded up the system for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce expense for the parties . For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop , he has been called the founder of English commercial law . He is perhaps now best known for his judgment in Somersett 's Case ( 1772 ) , where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by positive law ( legislation ) in England , and therefore was not binding in law ; this judgement did not , however , end slave trafficking .",
