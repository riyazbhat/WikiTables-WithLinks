  "/wiki/Muscogee_(Creek)_Nation": "The Muscogee ( Creek ) Nation is a federally recognized Native American tribe based in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . The nation descends from the historic Creek Confederacy , a large group of indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands . Official languages include Muscogee , Yuchi , Natchez , Alabama , and Koasati , with Muscogee retaining the largest number of speakers . They commonly refer to themselves as Este Mvskokvlke ( pronounced [ isti m\u0259sk\u00f3g\u0259lgi ] ) . Historically , they were often referred to by European Americans as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast . The Muscogee ( Creek ) Nation is the largest of the federally recognized Muscogee tribes . The Muskogean-speaking Alabama , Koasati , Hitchiti , and Natchez people is also enrolled in this nation . Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and Yuchi ( language isolate ) are also enrolled in the Muscogee Creek Nation , although historically , the latter two groups were from different language families and cultures than the Muscogee . Other federally recognized Muscogee groups include the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town , Kialegee Tribal Town , and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town of Oklahoma ; the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana , the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas , and the Poarch Band of Creeks in Alabama .",
  "/wiki/Indian_Territory": "As general terms , Indian Territory or the Indian Territories describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land . In general , the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in 1803 . The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the US federal government 's 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal . After the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , the policy of the US government was one of assimilation . The term Indian Reserve describes lands the British government set aside for Indigenous tribes between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River in the time before the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) . Indian Territory later came to refer to an unorganized territory whose general borders were initially set by the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 , and was the successor to the remainder of the Missouri Territory after Missouri received statehood . The borders of Indian Territory were reduced in size as various Organic Acts were passed by Congress to create incorporated territories of the United States . The 1907 Oklahoma Enabling Act created the single state of Oklahoma by combining Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory , ending the existence of an Indian Territory . Indian reservations remain within the boundaries of US states , but largely exempt from state jurisdiction . The term Indian country is used to lands under the control of Native nations , including Indian reservations , trust lands on tribal jurisdictional areas , or , more casually , to describe anywhere large numbers of Native Americans live .",
  "/wiki/Treaty_with_Choctaws_and_Chickasaws": "The Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws was a treaty signed on July 12 , 1861 between the Choctaw and Chickasaw ( American Indian ) and the Confederate States of America . At the beginning of the American Civil War , Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans . In this capacity he negotiated several treaties , one of the most important being with Cherokee chief John Ross , which was concluded in 1861 . The treaty was ratified and was proclaimed on December 20 , 1861 by the Confederacy . The Choctaw and Chickasaw also duly ratified the treaty . Some Choctaws identified with the Southern cause and a few owned slaves . In addition , they well remembered and resented the Indian removals from thirty years earlier and poor service they received from the federal government . The main reason the Choctaw Nation agreed to sign the treaty , however , was for protection from regional tribes .",
  "/wiki/Choctaw": "The Choctaw ( Choctaw : Chahta ) [ note 1 ] are a Native American people originally occupying what is now the Southeastern United States ( modern-day Alabama , Florida , Mississippi and Louisiana ) . Their Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group . They are believed to be descended from the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures , who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries . About 1,700 years ago , the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya , a great earthwork mound in what is present-day central Mississippi . It is still considered sacred by the Choctaw , who regained control of the site in 2008 . The anthropologist John Reed Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader . Henry Halbert , a historian , suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase Hacha hatak ( river people ) . The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century in the Southeast encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs . The Choctaw coalesced as a people in the 17th century , and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions : eastern , western and southern . These groups sometimes formed distinct , independent alliances with European powers , including the French , based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana Territory ; the English of the Southeast ; and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era . During the American Revolution , most Choctaw supported the Thirteen Colonies ' bid for independence from the British Empire . They never went to war against the United States , but were forcibly relocated in 1831-33 as part of Indian Removal , in order for the US to take over their land in the Southeast for development by European Americans .",
  "/wiki/Chickasaw_Nation": "The Chickasaw Nation is a federally recognized Native American nation , located in Oklahoma in the United States . The Chickasaw Nation originated in its homeland of the American Southeast , with territory in what are defined as modern-day Mississippi , Tennessee , Alabama and Kentucky . In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , European Americans knew the Chickasaw as one of the historic Five Civilized Tribes , all of whom were based in what became the Southeastern United States .",
  "/wiki/Seminole": "The Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida . Today , they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida , and comprise three federally recognized tribes : the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma , the Seminole Tribe of Florida , and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida , as well as independent groups . The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century , most significantly northern Muscogee ( Creeks ) from what is now Georgia and Alabama . The word Seminole is derived from the Muscogee word siman\u00f3-li , which may itself be derived from the Spanish word cimarr\u00f3n , meaning runaway or wild one . Seminole culture is largely derived from that of the Creek ; the most important ceremony is the Green Corn Dance ; other notable traditions include use of the black drink and ritual tobacco . As the Seminole adapted to Florida environs , they developed local traditions , such as the construction of open-air , thatched-roof houses known as chickees . Historically the Seminole spoke Mikasuki and Creek , both Muskogean languages . The Seminole became increasingly independent of other Creek groups and established their own identity . They developed a thriving trade network during the British and second Spanish periods ( roughly 1767-1821 ) . The tribe expanded considerably during this time , and was further supplemented from the late 18th century by free blacks and escaped slaves who settled near and paid tribute to Seminole towns . The latter became known as Black Seminoles , although they kept their own Gullah culture . After the United States achieved independence , its settlers increased pressure on Seminole lands , leading to the Seminole Wars ( 1818-1858 ) .",
  "/wiki/Comanche": "The Comanche /k\u0259\u02c8m\u00e6nt\u0283i/ ( Comanche : N\u0289m\u0289n\u0289\u0289 ) are a Native-American nation from the Great Plains whose historic territory consisted of most of present-day northwestern Texas and adjacent areas in eastern New Mexico , southeastern Colorado , southwestern Kansas , western Oklahoma , and northern Chihuahua . Within the United States , the government federally recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation , headquartered in Lawton , Oklahoma . The Comanche became the dominant tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries . They are often characterized [ by whom ? ] as Lords of the Plains and , reflecting their erstwhile prominence , they presided over a large area called Comancheria , which came to include large portions of present-day Texas , Colorado , New Mexico , Oklahoma and Kansas . Comanche power depended on bison , horses , trading , and raiding . The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins ; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile ; they traded with the Spanish , French , Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples ; and ( most famously ) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans . They took captives from weaker tribes during warfare , using them as slaves or selling them to the Spanish and ( later ) Mexican settlers . They also took thousands of captives from the Spanish , Mexican , and American settlers and incorporated them into Comanche society . Decimated by European diseases , warfare , and encroachment by Americans on Comancheria , most Comanches were forced into life on the reservation ; a few however sought refuge with the Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico , or with the Kickapoos in Mexico . A number of them returned in the 1890s and early 1900s . In the 21st century , the Comanche Nation has 17,000 members , around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton , Fort Sill , and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma .",

In colonial times they were a semi-migratory Native American nation , primarily inhabiting areas of the Ohio Valley , extending from what became Ohio and Kentucky eastward to West Virginia , Virginia , Pennsylvania , and Western Maryland ; south to Alabama and South Carolina ; and westward to Indiana , and Illinois . Pushed west by European-American pressure , the Shawnee migrated to Missouri and Kansas . In the 1830s some were removed from the upper Midwest to Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) west of the Mississippi River . Other Shawnee did not remove to Oklahoma until after the Civil War .

[ notes 1 ] Today , Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma ; the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin ; and the Munsee-Delaware Nation , Moravian of the Thames First Nation , and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario . The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal . During the decades of the 18th century , most Lenape were pushed out of their homeland by expanding European colonies . Their dire situation was exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts . The divisions and troubles of the American Revolutionary War and United States ' independence pushed them farther west . In the 1860s , the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory ( present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory ) under the Indian removal policy . In the 21st century , most Lenape now reside in Oklahoma , with some communities living also in Wisconsin and Ontario .",

The tribe developed in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys around 700 BC along with other groups of its language family . They migrated west of the Mississippi after the 17th century due to wars with Iroquois invading the Ohio Valley from New York and Pennsylvania in a search for new hunting grounds . The nations separated at that time , and the Osage settled near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers . The term Osage is a French version of the tribe 's name , which can be roughly translated as warlike . The Osage people refer to themselves in their indigenous Dhegihan Siouan language as \ud801\udccf\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcdf ( Wazhazhe ) , or Mid-waters . At the height of their power in the early 19th century , the Osage had become the dominant power in the region , feared by neighboring tribes . The tribe controlled the area between the Missouri and Red rivers , the Ozarks to the east and the foothills of the Wichita Mountains to the south . They depended on nomadic buffalo hunting and agriculture . The 19th-century painter George Catlin described the Osage as the tallest race of men in North America , either red or white skins ; there being ... many of them six and a half , and others seven feet . The missionary Isaac McCoy described the Osage as an uncommonly fierce , courageous , warlike nation and said they were the finest looking Indians I have ever seen in the West . In the Ohio Valley , the Osage originally lived among speakers of the same Dhegihan language stock , such as the Kansa , Ponca , Omaha , and Quapaw .",

  "/wiki/Cherokee": "The Cherokee ( /\u02c8t\u0283\u025br\u0259ki\u02d0/ ; Cherokee : \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb\u13ef\u13a2 , romanized : Aniyvwiya\u0294i , or Cherokee : \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9 , romanized : Tsalagi ) are one of the indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands of the United States . Prior to the 18th century , they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina , southeastern Tennessee , edges of western South Carolina , northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama . The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group . In the 19th century , James Mooney , an American ethnographer , recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region , where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived ; however , anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago . By the 19th century , European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the Five Civilized Tribes , because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers . Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes : the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina , the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians ( UKB ) in Oklahoma , and the Cherokee Nation ( CN ) in Oklahoma . The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members , making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States . In addition , numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage , and some of these are state-recognized . A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to claim having Cherokee ancestry on the US census , which includes persons who are not enrolled members of any tribe . Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes , the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah , Oklahoma . The UKB are mostly descendants of Old Settlers , Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal . They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act .",
  "/wiki/John_Ross_(Cherokee_chief)": "John Ross ( Cherokee : \u13ab\u13eb\u13cd\u13ab\u13eb , romanized : guwisguwi ) ( October 3 , 1790 - August 1 , 1866 ) , ( meaning in Cherokee : Mysterious Little White Bird ) , was the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1828-1866 , serving longer in this position than any other person . Described as the Moses of his people , Ross influenced the Indian nation through such tumultuous events as the relocation to Indian Territory and the American Civil War . John Ross was the son of a Cherokee mother and a Scottish father . His mother and maternal grandmother were of mixed Scots-Cherokee ancestry , since his maternal grandfather was another Scottish immigrant . As a result , young John ( one-eighth Cherokee by blood quantum ) grew up bilingual and bicultural , an experience that served him well when his parents decided to send him to schools that served other mixed-race Cherokee . After graduation , he was appointed an Indian agent in 1811 . During the War of 1812 , he served as adjutant of a Cherokee regiment under the command of Andrew Jackson . After the Red Stick War ended , Ross demonstrated his business acumen by starting a tobacco plantation in Tennessee . In 1816 , he built a warehouse and trading post on the Tennessee River north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek , and started a ferry service that carried passengers from the south side of the river ( Cherokee Nation ) to the north side ( USA ) . His businesses served as the start of a community known as Ross 's Landing on the Tennessee River ( now modern-day Chattanooga , Tennessee ) . Concurrently , John Ross developed a keen interest in Cherokee politics , attracting the attention of the Cherokee elders , especially Principal Chiefs Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks , who , along with Major Ridge , became his political mentors . Ross first went to Washington , D.C. in 1816 as part of a Cherokee delegation to negotiate issues of national boundaries , land ownership and white encroachment ."
