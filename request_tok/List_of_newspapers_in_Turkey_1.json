  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states",

Originally spoken in Spain and then after the Edict of Expulsion spreading through the former territories of the Ottoman Empire ( the Balkans , Turkey , the Middle East , and North Africa ) as well as France , Italy , the Netherlands , Morocco , and England , it is today spoken mainly by Sephardic minorities in more than 30 countries , with most of the speakers residing in Israel . Although it has no official status in any country , it has been acknowledged as a minority language in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Israel , France and Turkey . It is also formally recognised by the Royal Spanish Academy . The core vocabulary of Judaeo-Spanish is Old Spanish and it has numerous elements from all the old Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula : Old Aragonese , Astur-Leonese , Old Catalan , Galician-Portuguese and Mozarabic . The language has been further enriched by Ottoman Turkish and Semitic vocabulary , such as Hebrew , Aramaic , and Arabic - especially in the domains of religion , law and spirituality - and most of the vocabulary for new and modern concepts has been adopted through French and Italian . Furthermore , the language is influenced to a lesser degree by other local languages of the Balkans , such as Greek , Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian . Historically , the Rashi script and its cursive form Solitreo have been the main orthographies for writing Judaeo-Spanish . However , today it is mainly written with the Latin alphabet , though some other alphabets such as Hebrew and Cyrillic are still in use . Judaeo-Spanish is known by many different names , mostly : Espa\u00f1ol ( Espanyol , Spaniol , Spaniolish , Espanioliko ) , Judi\u00f3 ( Judyo , Djudyo ) or Jidi\u00f3 ( Jidyo , Djidyo ) , Judesmo ( Judezmo , Djudezmo ) , Sefaradh\u00ed ( Sefaradi ) or \u1e24aket\u00eda ( in North Africa ) . In Turkey and formerly in the Ottoman Empire , it has been traditionally called Yahudice in Turkish , meaning the Jewish language .

The classification of Laki as a sub-dialect of Southern Kurdish or as a fourth dialect of Kurdish is unsettled , but the differences between Laki and other Southern Kurdish dialects are minimal . The literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century , when more general literature became developed . Today , the two principal written Kurdish dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani .

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere .

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora . Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary",

It is not fully intelligible with the rest of Armenian . It was not a written language until 1995 , when linguist Bert Vaux designed an orthographic system for it based on the Turkish alphabet ; the Armenian alphabet was used by Christian immigrants from Hamshen ( Northern Hamshenis ) - who refer to the language as Homshetsma ( \u0540\u0578\u0574\u0577\u0565\u0581\u0574\u0561 ) in Russia and Abkhazia . Homshetsi is a spoken language amongst the Eastern Hemshinli , also known as the Hopa Hemshinli , who live in a small number of villages in Turkey 's Artvin Province and Central Asia . The Western or Rize Hamsheni are a related , geographically separate group living in Rize Province , who spoke Homshetsi until sometime in the 19th century . They now speak only Turkish with many Homshetsi loanwords . A third group , the northern Homshentsik , who live in Russia , Georgia ( Abkhazia ) , Armenia , also speak Homshetsi . Homshetsi has linguistic features that indicate it belongs to the Western Armenian dialect group ; however , the two are generally not mutually intelligible . Homshetsi has close ties to the Armenian dialects formerly found in northeastern Turkey , in particular in Khodorchur and , to a lesser extent , in Trabzon . Because of its extended isolation , Homshetsi contains many archaisms that set it apart from all other Armenian dialects . The language preserves forms found only in Classical and Middle Armenian , and at the same time preserves foreign ( especially Arab and Turkish ) grammatical and lexical components that were stripped from modern Armenian during the twentieth century . Homshetsma therefore gives us one of our only glimpses of Armenian in its 'pure ' form , writes Bert Vaux",

Its speakers are referred to as Pontic Greeks or Pontian Greeks . The linguistic lineage of Pontic Greek stems from Ionic Greek via Koine and Byzantine Greek , and contains influences from Georgian , Russian , Turkish and Armenian . Pontic Greek is an endangered Indo-European language spoken by about 778,000 people worldwide . However , only 200,000-300,000 are considered active speakers . Although it is mainly spoken in Northern Greece , it is also spoken in Turkey , Russia , Armenia , Georgia and Kazakhstan and by the Pontic diaspora . The language was brought to Greece in the 1920s after the expulsion of the Christian Pontic Greeks from their homeland during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey . However , it is still spoken in pockets of the Pontus today , mostly by Pontic Greek Muslims in the eastern districts of Trabzon Province . Pontic Greek is considered a dialect of modern Greek , although reportedly , the speakers of each do not fully understand each other . It is primarily written in the Greek script , while in Turkey and Ukraine the Latin script is used more frequently"
