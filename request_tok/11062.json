He was a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time . Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .

Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture , he did not set out to rebel against the past . He was schooled traditionally , took a craftsman-like approach to his work , and desired academic recognition , although he was never accepted into Paris 's foremost school of art . Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex , turbulent , deeply pocketed surface in clay . Many of his most notable sculptures were criticized during his lifetime . They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions , in which works were decorative , formulaic , or highly thematic . Rodin 's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory , modeled the human body with realism , and celebrated individual character and physicality . Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work , but refused to change his style . Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community . From the unexpected realism of his first major figure - inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy - to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought , Rodin 's reputation grew , and he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time . By 1900 , he was a world-renowned artist .
