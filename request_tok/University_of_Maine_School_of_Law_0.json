  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party )",

Located in New England , it is bordered by New Hampshire to the west , the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast , and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Qu\u00e9bec to the northeast and northwest , respectively .

For thousands of years , indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine . At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine , several Algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area . The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island , by Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons . The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years",

The Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Governor of Vermont with confirmation by the Vermont Senate . When a judicial vacancy occurs , the judicial nominating board submits to the governor the names of as many persons as it deems qualified for appointment . All Supreme Court justices come up for retention at the same time every six years . The next retention date is March 31 , 2023 . The Joint Committee on Judicial Retention reviews a justice 's performance during the previous term and recommends to the Vermont General Assembly whether the justice should be retained . The committee consists of four House members appointed by the Speaker of the House and four Senate members appointed by the Committee on Committees . After open debate and discussion , the General Assembly votes by secret ballot , with a majority having to vote against reappointment for a justice to be denied another term . In addition to the retention process , any Vermont judge may be removed at any time in one of two ways : ( 1 ) Judges may be impeached by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and convicted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate , and ( 2 ) a Judicial Conduct Board investigates complaints of judicial misconduct or disability and recommends any necessary action to the Supreme Court .

It is composed of seven justices , who are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Maine Senate . From 1820 until 1839 , justices served lifetime appointments with a mandatory retirement age of 70 . Beginning in 1839 , justices are appointed for seven-year terms , with no limit on the number of terms that they may serve . Known as the Law Court when sitting as an appellate court , the Supreme Court 's other functions include hearing appeals of sentences longer than one year of incarceration , overseeing admission to the bar and the conduct of its members , and promulgating rules for all the state 's courts . The Maine Supreme Judicial Court is one of the few state supreme courts in the United States authorized to issue advisory opinions , which it does upon request by the governor or legislature , as set out in the Maine Constitution . It is also unusual for a state 's highest appellate court in that its primary location is not that of the state 's capital city , Augusta , partially because the Kennebec County Courthouse did not have a courtroom large enough for the Supreme Court 's proceedings . The court did meet there from 1830 until 1970 , when it permanently moved to the Cumberland County Courthouse . The renovation of the Kennebec County Courthouse in 2015 , which included expansion of the bench in its largest courtroom to permit all 7 MSJC justices to sit there , will allow the court to meet there at least twice a year . It will also continue to meet in Portland , Bangor , and at high schools around the state . The MSJC is also authorized to rule on the fitness of the Governor of Maine to serve in office , which it does upon the Maine Secretary of State certifying to the court that the governor is temporarily unable to carry out the duties of that office . The court must then hold a hearing and , if it agrees that the governor is unfit , declare the office of governor temporarily vacant and transfer its duties to the President of the Maine Senate , who would serve as acting governor",
