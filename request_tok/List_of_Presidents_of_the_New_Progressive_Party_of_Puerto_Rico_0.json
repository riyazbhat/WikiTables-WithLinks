  "/wiki/President_of_the_Senate_of_Puerto_Rico": "The President of the Senate of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Presidente del Senado ) is the highest-ranking officer and the presiding officer of the Senate of Puerto Rico . The president has voting powers as it is elected amongst the own members of the Senate as established by Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico . The Constitution , however , does not establish its functions and since the Senate is the only body authorized by the Constitution to regulate its own internal affairs , the functions of the president vary from session to session - save being called President as the Constitution establishes . The president is typically elected during the Senate 's inaugural session . When absent , the president is substituted by the President pro tempore . Its counterpart in the House is the Speaker . The current president is Thomas Rivera Schatz , senator at-large from the New Progressive Party .",
  "/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico": "The governor of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : gobernador ( a ) de Puerto Rico ) is the head of government of Puerto Rico and , by its nature , constitutes the executive branch of the government of the island . The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the island 's military forces , the Puerto Rico National Guard . The governor has a duty to enforce its laws , to convene the Legislative Assembly , the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly , to appoint government officers , to appoint justices , and to grant pardons . Since 1948 , the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico . Prior to that , the governor was appointed either by the king of Spain ( 1510-1898 ) or the president of the United States ( 1898-1948 ) . Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers them with the faculty to appoint officers . Law No . 104 of 1956 empowers them with the faculty to delegate functions . These two faculties in conjunction allow the governor to delegate most of their functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government . Most of the governor 's functions are delegated [ citation needed ] to the chief of staff , who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies . The budget is delegated to the director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the president of the Planning Board . This effectively makes the governor a political figure rather than an administrative one , allowing them to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day-to-day operations .",

  "/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Secretary of State of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Secretario de Estado de Puerto Rico ) leads all efforts that promote the cultural , political , and economical relations between Puerto Rico and foreign countries , and other jurisdictions of the United States . The post was created by Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which merely establishes that the secretary serves as acting governor when the governor is unable to perform his duties - a post similar to that of a lieutenant governor in U.S. politics . In recent times , however , the post has evolved into one similar to that of a foreign minister . Today , the secretary is the officer in charge of Puerto Rico 's foreign relations , albeit under the consent of Congress or the U.S. Department of State due to Puerto Rico 's political status . Administratively , the post differs to other similar titles in U.S. politics . Namely , that in contrast to lieutenant governors , the secretary is not elected by the people . He is instead appointed by the governor with advice and consent from both the Senate and House of Representatives . In addition , the secretary does not have any role whatsoever in the state legislature , in contrast to lieutenant governors . Unlike secretaries of state in other U.S. jurisdictions , the secretary of state of Puerto Rico does not take part in the elections process . That responsibility falls into the State Commission on Elections . Yet , the post does have some similarities to other U.S. secretaries of state . For example , the secretary of state of Puerto Rico is also the chief clerk of the commonwealth and the primary custodian of important records .",
