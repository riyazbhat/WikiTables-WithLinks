Phnom Bakheng was constructed just before the foundation of Yasodharapura due to Yasovarman 's belief that the mountain was among the holiest of places to worship the Hindu deities . Yashodharapura was linked to an earlier capital , Hariharalaya , by a causeway . The urban complex included the Yashodharatataka . :64-65 The succeeding capitals built in the area were called Yasodharapura . One of those is Angkor Thom , centred on the Bayon temple by King Jayavarman VII ( 1181-1218AD ) . In 1352 , King U Thong ( also known as Ramathibodi I of the Ayutthaya Kingdom ) laid siege to it .

The city and empire flourished from approximately the 9th to the 15th centuries . The city houses the magnificent Angkor Wat , one of Cambodia 's most popular tourist attractions . The word Angkor is derived from the Sanskrit nagara ( \u0928\u0917\u0930 ) , meaning city . The Angkorian period began in AD 802 , when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself a universal monarch and god-king , and lasted until the late 14th century , first falling under Ayutthayan suzerainty in 1351 . A Khmer rebellion against Siamese authority resulted in the 1431 sacking of Angkor by Ayutthaya , causing its population to migrate south to Longvek . The ruins of Angkor are located amid forests and farmland north of the Great Lake ( Tonl\u00e9 Sap ) and south of the Kulen Hills , near modern-day Siem Reap city ( 13\u00b024\u2032N , 103\u00b051\u2032E ) , in Siem Reap Province . The temples of the Angkor area number over one thousand , ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the Angkor Wat , said to be the world 's largest single religious monument . Many of the temples at Angkor have been restored , and together , they comprise the most significant site of Khmer architecture . Visitors approach two million annually , and the entire expanse , including Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom is collectively protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The popularity of the site among tourists presents multiple challenges to the preservation of the ruins .",

The empire , which grew out of the former kingdoms of Funan and Chenla , at times ruled over and/or vassalised most of mainland Southeast Asia and parts of Southern China , stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province , China , and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar . Its greatest legacy is Angkor , in present-day Cambodia , which was the site of the capital city during the empire 's zenith . The majestic monuments of Angkor , such as Angkor Wat and Bayon , bear testimony to the Khmer Empire 's immense power and wealth , impressive art and culture , architectural technique , aesthetics achievements , and the variety of belief systems that it patronised over time . Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor , during its peak in the 11th to 13th centuries , was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world . The beginning of the era of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802 CE when King Jayavarman II declared himself chakravartin ( king of the world , or king of kings ) on Phnom Kulen . The empire ended with the fall of Angkor in the 15th century .",

Ayutthaya was friendly towards foreign traders , including the Chinese , Portuguese , Indians , Japanese , Persians , Pathans , and later Spaniards , Dutch , English , and French , permitting them to set up villages outside the walls of the capital , also called Ayutthaya . In the 16th century , it was described by foreign traders as one of the biggest and wealthiest cities in the East . The court of King Narai ( 1656-1688 ) had strong links with that of King Louis XIV of France , whose ambassadors compared the city in size and wealth to Paris . By 1550 , the kingdom 's vassals included some city-states in the Malay Peninsula , Sukhothai , Lan Na and parts of Burma and Cambodia .

As reliable sources ( for the 15th and 16th centuries , in particular ) are very rare , a defensible and conclusive explanation that relates to concrete events that manifest the decline of the Khmer Empire , recognised unanimously by the scientific community , has so far not been produced . However , most modern historians have approached a consensus in which several distinct and gradual changes of religious , dynastic , administrative and military nature , environmental problems and ecological imbalance coincided with shifts of power in Indochina and must all be taken into account to make an interpretation . In recent years scholars ' focus has shifted increasingly towards human-environment interactions and the ecological consequences , including natural disasters , such as flooding and droughts . Stone epigraphy in temples , which had been the primary source for Khmer history , is already a rarity throughout the 13th century , ends in the third decade of the fourteenth , and does not resume until the mid-16th century . Recording of the Royal Chronology discontinues with King Jayavarman IX Parameshwara ( or Jayavarma-Paramesvara ) , who reigned from 1327 to 1336 . There exists not a single contemporary record of even a kings name for over 200 years . Construction and maintenance of monumental temple architecture had come to a standstill after Jayavarman VII 's reign . According to author Michael Vickery there only exist external sources for Cambodias 15th century , the Chinese Ming Shilu ( engl . veritable records ) annals and the earliest Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya , which must be interpreted with greatest caution . Wang Shi-zhen ( \u738b\u4e16\u8c9e ) , a Chinese scholar of the 16th century , is noted as having remarked : The official historians are unrestrained and are skillful at concealing the truth ; but the memorials and statutes they record and the documents they copy can not be discarded . The single incident which undoubtedly reflects reality , the central reference point for the entire 15th century , is a Siamese intervention of some undisclosed nature at the capital Yasodharapura ( Angkor Thom ) around the year 1431 .",

During the 19th century , the Dutch possessions and hegemony were expanded , reaching their greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century . This colony was one of the most valuable colonies under the Dutch Empire 's rule , and contributed to Dutch global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th to early 20th century . The colonial social order was based on rigid racial and social structures with a Dutch elite living separate from but linked to their native subjects . The term Indonesia came into use for the geographical location after 1880 . In the early 20th century , local intellectuals began developing the concept of Indonesia as a nation state , and set the stage for an independence movement . Japan 's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy . Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 , Indonesian nationalists declared independence which they fought to secure during the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution . The Netherlands formally recognized sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference with the exception of the Netherlands New Guinea ( Western New Guinea ) , whose administration was transferred under authority of Resolution 1752 ( XVII ) to the United Nations 13 years later in 1962 ( also see New York Agreement ) .",

The Allies promoted the alliance as a means to control German , Japanese and Italian aggression . At the start of the war on 1 September 1939 , the Allies consisted of France , Poland and the United Kingdom , as well as their dependent states , such as British India . Within days they were joined by the independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth : Australia , Canada , New Zealand and South Africa . After the start of the German invasion of North Europe until the Balkan Campaign , the Netherlands , Belgium , Greece , and Yugoslavia joined the Allies . After first having cooperated with Germany in invading Poland whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict , the Soviet Union perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany . The United States provided war materiel and money all along , and officially joined in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . China had already been in a prolonged war with Japan since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 1937 , but officially joined the Allies in 1941 . The alliance was formalised by the Declaration by United Nations , from 1 January 1942 . However , the name United Nations was rarely used to describe the Allies during the war . The leaders of the Big Three - the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and the United States - controlled Allied strategy ; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close . The Big Three together with China were referred as a trusteeship of the powerful , then were recognized as the Allied Big Four in the Declaration by United Nations and later as the Four Policemen of the United Nations .",

In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state .

Pagan Period ; also commonly known as the Pagan Dynasty and the Pagan Empire ) was the first kingdom to unify the regions that would later constitute modern-day Burma ( Myanmar ) . Pagan 's 250-year rule over the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery laid the foundation for the ascent of Burmese language and culture , the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma , and the growth of Theravada Buddhism in Burma and in mainland Southeast Asia . The kingdom grew out of a small 9th-century settlement at Pagan ( Bagan ) by the Mranma ( Burmans ) , who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the Kingdom of Nanzhao . Over the next two hundred years , the small principality gradually grew to absorb its surrounding regions until the 1050s and 1060s when King Anawrahta founded the Pagan Empire , for the first time unifying under one polity the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery . By the late 12th century Anawrahta 's successors had extended their influence farther to the south into the upper Malay peninsula , to the east at least to the Salween river , in the farther north to below the current China border , and to the west , in northern Arakan and the Chin Hills . In the 12th and 13th centuries , Pagan , alongside the Khmer Empire , was one of two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley , eclipsing the Pyu , Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century . Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level although Tantric , Mahayana , Brahmanic , and animist practices remained heavily entrenched at all social strata . Pagan 's rulers built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone of which over 2000 remain . The wealthy donated tax-free land to religious authorities . The kingdom went into decline in the mid-13th century as the continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth by the 1280s had severely affected the crown 's ability to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen .",
