There are , however , two matches involving W. G. Grace in 1879 and 1881 which are considered first-class by some authorities . In 1891 , Somerset joined the County Championship , which had just become an officially recognised competition , and has important match status from 1891 to 1894 . The county is classified as an official first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and the County Championship clubs ; classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963 ; and classified as a senior Twenty20 team since 2003 .
