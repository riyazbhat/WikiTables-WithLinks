Prior to the appointment , he served as Archbishop of Manila from 2011 to 2020 . Tagle also serves as the president of Caritas International , a federation of Catholic relief , development , and social service organizations , and of the Catholic Biblical Federation . He generally prefers to be called by his nickname , Chito , rather than by his clerical title . Tagle is involved in many social issues in the Philippines , with emphasis on helping the poor while defending the Catholic Church 's opposition to abortion , contraception ( equated with abortion in the Philippines ) , and what he has called practical atheism . Dubbed as the Asian Francis , he is often seen as a representative of the Church 's progressive wing . Tagle has criticized the Church for using harsh words to describe LGBT as well as divorced and remarried Catholics , whom he believes should be allowed to receive Holy Communion on a case-by-case basis .",
  "/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Evangelization_of_Peoples": "The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples ( Latin : Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione ) is a congregation of the Roman Curia of the Catholic Church in Rome , responsible for missionary work and related activities . It is perhaps better known by its former title , the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith ( Latin : Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide ) , or simply the Propaganda Fide . In principle it is responsible for pre-diocesan missionary jurisdictions ( of the Latin rite ) : Mission sui iuris , Apostolic prefecture ( neither entitled to a titular bishop ) Apostolic vicariate ; equivalents of other rites ( e.g . Apostolic exarchate ) are in the sway of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches . However many former missionary jurisdictions - mainly in the Third World - remain , after promotion to diocese of ( Metropolitan ) Archdiocese , under the Propaganda Fide instead of the normally competent Congregation for Bishops , notably in countries/regions where the Catholic church is too poor/small ( as in most African countries ) to aspire self-sufficiency and/or local authorities hostile to Catholic/Christian/any ( organized ) faith . It was founded by Pope Gregory XV in 1622 to arrange missionary work on behalf of the various religious institutions , and in 1627 Pope Urban VIII established within it a training college for missionaries , the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide . When Pope Paul VI reorganized and adjusted the tasks of the Roman Curia with the publication of Regimini Ecclesiae Universae 15 August 1967 , the name of the congregation was changed to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples . The early congregation was established in the Palazzo Ferratini , donated by Juan Bautista Vives , to the south of the Piazza di Spagna . Two of the foremost artistic figures of Baroque Rome were involved in the development of the architectural complex ; the sculptor and architect Gianlorenzo Bernini and the architect Francesco Borromini . The current Prefect of the Congregation is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle since December 2019 . The current Secretary is Archbishop Protase Rugambwa . The current Secretary ( and President of the Pontifical Mission Societies ) is Archbishop Giampietro Del Toso The Under-Secretary is Father Ryszard Szmydki , O.M.I .",
  "/wiki/Roman_Curia": "The Roman Curia comprises the administrative institutions of the Holy See [ note 1 ] and the central body through which the affairs of the Catholic Church are conducted . It acts in the Pope 's name and with his authority for the good and for the service of the particular churches and provides the central organization for the church to advance its objectives . [ note 2 ] The structure and organization of responsibilities within the Curia are at present regulated by the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus , issued by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988 , which Pope Francis has decided to revise . Other bodies that play an administrative or consulting role in ecclesial affairs are sometimes mistakenly identified with the Curia , such as the Synod of Bishops and regional conferences of bishops . Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller , former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , wrote in 2015 that the Synod of Bishops is not a part of the Roman Curia in the strict sense : it is the expression of the collegiality of bishops in communion with the Pope and under his direction . The Roman Curia instead aids the Pope in the exercise of his primacy over all the Churches .",

  "/wiki/Auxiliary_Bishop": "An auxiliary bishop is a bishop assigned to assist the diocesan bishop in meeting the pastoral and administrative needs of the diocese . Auxiliary bishops can also be titular bishops of sees that no longer exist . In the Catholic Church , auxiliary bishops exist in both the Latin Church and in the Eastern Catholic Churches . The particular duties of an auxiliary bishop are given by the diocesan bishop and can vary widely depending on the auxiliary bishop , the ordinary , and the needs of the diocese . In a larger archdiocese , they might be in assigned to serve a portion of the archdiocese ( sometimes called deaneries , regions , or vicariates ) or to serve a particular population such as immigrants or those of a particular heritage or language . Canon law requires that the diocesan bishop appoint each auxiliary bishop as vicar general or episcopal vicar of the diocese . In Eastern Orthodox Churches , auxiliary bishops are also called vicarian bishops or simply vicar-bishops . In the Serbian Orthodox Church , the office of auxiliary ( vicar ) bishop is entrusted to titular bishops , who are assigned with assisting diocesan bishops in various aspects of diocesan administration . The Greek word protosyncellus defines an auxiliary bishop who has been elevated to the dignity of vicarian of another titular bishop , and who is assigned to assist and act on behalf of his episcopal authority over the jurisdiction of the episcopal see . For example , Teodosije \u0160ibali\u0107 ( titular Bishop of Lipljan ) was appointed auxiliary bishop to the Eparchy of Ra\u0161ka and Prizren in 2004 .",
  "/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Los_Angeles": "The Archdiocese of Los Angeles ( Latin : Archidioecesis Angelorum in California , Spanish : Arquidi\u00f3cesis de Los \u00c1ngeles ) is an archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. state of California . Based in Los Angeles , the archdiocese comprises the California counties of Los Angeles , Santa Barbara and Ventura . The cathedral is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles , and its present archbishop is Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez . With approximately five million professing members , the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is numerically the single largest diocese in the United States . The Archbishop of Los Angeles also serves as metropolitan bishop of the suffragan dioceses within the Ecclesiastical Province of Los Angeles , which includes the Dioceses of Fresno , Monterey , Orange , San Bernardino , and San Diego . Following the establishment of the Spanish missions in California , the diocese of the Two Californias was established on 1840 , when Los Angeles region was still part of Mexico . In 1848 , the Mexican California was ceded to the United States , and the U.S. portion of the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey . The diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles in 1859 , and the episcopal see was moved to Los Angeles upon the completion of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in 1876 . Los Angeles split from Monterey to become the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego in 1922 . The diocese was split again in 1936 to create the Diocese of San Diego , and the Los Angeles see was elevated to an archdiocese . The archdiocese 's present territory was established in 1976 , when Orange County was split off to establish the Diocese of Orange .",

  "/wiki/Apostolic_Nuncio": "An apostolic nuncio ( also known as a papal nuncio or simply as a nuncio ) is an ecclesiastical diplomat , serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or to an international organization . A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See , and is the head of the diplomatic mission , called an Apostolic Nunciature , which is the equivalent of an embassy . The Holy See is legally distinct from the Vatican City or the Catholic Church . A nuncio is usually an archbishop . An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary , although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol . A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges . Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , to which the Holy See is a party , a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country . The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country , and may grant the deanship of that country 's diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority . The representative of the Holy See in some situations is called a Delegate or , in the case of the United Nations , Permanent Observer . In the Holy See hierarchy , these usually rank equally to a nuncio , but they do not have formal diplomatic status , though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges . In addition , the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation , supervising the diocesan episcopate ( usually a national conference of bishops which has its own chairman , usually the highest-ranking bishop or archbishop , especially if his seat carries the title of primate or he has individually been created a cardinal ) and has an important role in the selection of bishops .",

Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Bishop": "A bishop is an ordained , consecrated , or appointed member of the Christian clergy who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight . Within the Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox , Moravian , Anglican , Old Catholic and Independent Catholic churches , as well as the Assyrian Church of the East , bishops claim apostolic succession , a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles . Within these churches , bishops are seen as those who possess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy , including other bishops . Some Protestant churches , including the Lutheran and Methodist churches , have bishops serving similar functions as well , though not always understood to be within apostolic succession in the same way . A person ordained as a deacon , priest , and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ( ministerial ) priesthood , given responsibility by Christ to govern , teach , and sanctify the Body of Christ . Priests , deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) ."
