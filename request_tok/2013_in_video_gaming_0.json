Infinite is the third installment in the BioShock series , and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous BioShock games , it features similar gameplay concepts and themes . Irrational Games and creative director Ken Levine based the game 's setting on historical events at the turn of the 20th century , such as the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition , and based the story on the concept of American exceptionalism , while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 Occupy movement . The game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist , former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt , who is sent to the airborne city of Columbia to find a young woman , Elizabeth , who has been held captive there for most of her life . Though Booker rescues Elizabeth , the two become involved with the city 's warring factions : the nativist and elite Founders that rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for White Americans , and the Vox Populi , underground rebels representing the underclass of the city . During this conflict , Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate Tears in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia , and soon discovers her to be central to the city 's dark secrets . The player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game , eventually working with the AI-controlled Elizabeth . Like previous BioShock games , the player uses a combination of weapons , clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes , and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors . Elizabeth 's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces . In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture , the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat , including combat that takes place aboard the city 's Sky-Line roller coaster-like rail system . Downloadable content for the game includes a story-based mission , Burial at Sea , that links Infinite 's story to that of the original BioShock game .",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Flying close to flowers results in the player 's petal being followed by other flower petals . Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world , such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary wind turbines . The game features no text or dialogue , forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues . Flower was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player , rather than to be a challenging and fun game . This focus was sparked by Chen , who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience and that the emotional range of most games was very limited . The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art , removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players .",

It is the second-largest gaming company in the Americas and Europe by revenue and market capitalization after Activision Blizzard and ahead of Take-Two Interactive and Ubisoft as of March 2018 . Founded and incorporated on May 27 , 1982 , by Apple employee Trip Hawkins , the company was a pioneer of the early home computer games industry and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games .

  "/wiki/The_Stanley_Parable": "The Stanley Parable is an interactive drama and walking simulator video game designed by American developer Davey Wreden . The game was originally released on July 27 , 2011 as a free modification for Half-Life 2 . A high-definition stand-alone remake , including new story elements , was again designed by Davey Wreden together with Source engine modeler William Pugh , under the Galactic Cafe studio name . The remake was announced and approved via Steam Greenlight in 2012 , and was released on October 17 , 2013 for Microsoft Windows . Later updates of the game added support for OS X on December 19 , 2013 , and for Linux on September 9 , 2015 . While both the mod and the remake use the first-person perspective common to other Source engine mods , there are no combat or other action-based sequences . Instead , the player guides Stanley , the game 's protagonist , through a surreal environment while the narrator , voiced in the remake by British actor Kevan Brighting , delivers exposition . The player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths to take , and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next , the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice . Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator , and depending on the choices the player makes , they will encounter different endings to the game before it restarts . Wreden envisioned the game after considering that most major video game titles confine the user to its rules , and considered how to construct a narrative to challenge that notion . Outside of Brighting 's voice work as the narrator , Wreden built the modification himself , initially as a personal project for his career goals but soon expanding to a wider release once he had shown it to friends and other players . The modification received critical attention as a new variation of creating interactive storytelling within a game engine , and provided a thought-provoking narration to discuss with others on the nature of choice and predestination within video games .",

Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players , with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map . Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character , known as a hero , who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play . During a match , players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team 's heroes in player versus player combat . A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team 's Ancient , a large structure located within their base . Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog , lead designer of Defense of the Ancients , was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine . It was officially released for Microsoft Windows , OS X , and Linux-based personal computers via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013 , following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior . The game is fully free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked . To maintain it , Valve supports the game as a service , offering loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return , such as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs .
