  "/wiki/Slotback": "Slotback , sometimes referred to as an A-back or , especially in the United States , slot receiver , is a position in gridiron football . The slot is the area between the last offensive lineman on either side of the center and the wide receiver on that side . A player who lines up between those two players and behind the line of scrimmage is a slotback . The position is a fixture of Canadian football and indoor football , but is also used in American football . The slotback is similar to the wide receiver but also has many of the same traits as a running back or tight end ; a slotback lines up closer to the offensive line and often farther back than a wide receiver . Slotbacks are often as many as five yards behind the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped and , in the Canadian and indoor game , may also make a running start toward the line of scrimmage prior to the snap .

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations .

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle .

Down 16-13 , San Francisco got the ball on their own 8-yard line with 3:10 on the clock and marched 92 yards down the field in under three minutes . They then scored the winning touchdown on a Joe Montana pass to John Taylor with just 34 seconds left in the game . The game was tight throughout .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXIX": "Super Bowl XXIX was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion San Diego Chargers and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 1994 season . The 49ers defeated the Chargers by the score of 49-26 , becoming the first team to win five Super Bowl championships . The game was played on January 29 , 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami , Florida ( now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens , which became a separate city in 2003 ) . This game is regarded as 49ers quarterback Steve Young 's final leap out of the shadow of his predecessor , Joe Montana , who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers ( in 1982 , 1985 , 1989 , and 1990 ) , two with Young as the backup quarterback . With Young at the helm , and a defense consisting of several veteran free agents who joined the team during the previous offseason , San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13-3 record , and led the league in total points scored ( 505 ) . The Chargers , on the other hand , were regarded as a Cinderella team , and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11-5 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins . This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters . The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total touchdowns both remain Super Bowl records . Still , the 49ers controlled most of the game , with Young completing touchdown passes in each of the 49ers ' first two drives . The Chargers were able to cut the deficit late in the first quarter , 14-7 , on a 13-play , 78-yard drive , but could not slow down San Francisco afterwards . Young was named the Super Bowl MVP , throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes , and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards . Despite the predicted blowout ( 18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl ) , the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base , and two teams from California playing , which could have significantly diminished interest along the East Coast , the telecast of the game on ABC still had a Nielsen rating of 41.3 .",

From 2014 through 2016 , the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format , where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains ( who are each in the Hall of Fame ) , instead of selecting players from each conference . The players were picked in a televised schoolyard pick prior to the game . Unlike most major sports leagues , which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their regular seasons , the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season . The first official Pro Bowl was played in January 1951 , three weeks after the 1950 NFL Championship Game ( between 1939 and 1942 , the NFL experimented with all-star games pitting the league 's champion against a team of all-stars ) . Between 1970 and 2009 , the Pro Bowl was usually held the weekend after the Super Bowl . Since 2010 , it has been played the weekend before the Super Bowl . Players from the two teams competing in the Super Bowl do not participate . For years , the game has suffered from lack of interest due to perceived low quality , with observers and commentators expressing their disfavor with it in its current state . It draws lower TV ratings than regular season NFL games , although the game draws similar ratings to other major all-star games , such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game .
