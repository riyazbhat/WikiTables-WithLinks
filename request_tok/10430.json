Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent .

It is located on the southeast coast of Tanegashima , an island approximately 40 km south of Kyushu . It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan ( NASDA ) was formed , and is now run by JAXA . The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly , testing , launching , and tracking satellites , as well as rocket engine firing tests .",
  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

The installation falls under the jurisdiction of the 30th Space Wing , United States Space Force ( USSF ) . Vandenberg AFB is a Department of Defense space and missile testing base , with a mission of placing satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast using expendable boosters ( Pegasus , Taurus , Minotaur , Atlas V , and Delta IV ) and reusable boosters ( SpaceX 's Falcon 9 ) . Wing personnel also support the Service 's LGM-30G Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Force Development Evaluation program . In addition to its military mission , the base also leases launch pad facilities to SpaceX ( SLC-4E ) , as well as 100 acres ( 40 ha ) leased to the California Spaceport in 1995 . Established in 1941 , the base is named in honor of former Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg .",
  "/wiki/Xichang_Satellite_Launch_Center": "The Xichang Satellite Launch Center ( XSLC ) , also known as the Xichang Space Center , is a People 's Republic of China space vehicle launch facility ( spaceport ) approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 miles ) northwest of Xichang , Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan . The facility became operational in 1984 and is primarily used to launch powerful thrust rockets and geostationary communications and weather satellites . It is notable as the site of Sino-European space cooperation , with the launch of the first of two Double Star scientific satellites in December 2003 . Chinese officials have indicated interest in conducting additional international satellite launches from XSLC . In 1996 , a fatal accident occurred when the rocket carrying the Intelsat 708 satellite failed on launch from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center . Also , a 2007 test of an anti-satellite missile occurred from the center ."
