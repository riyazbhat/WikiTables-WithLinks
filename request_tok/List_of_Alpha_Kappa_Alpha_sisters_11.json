  "/wiki/Judge": "A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings , either alone or as a part of a panel of judges . The powers , functions , method of appointment , discipline , and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions . The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and , typically , in an open court . The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case , assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties , and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment . In some jurisdictions , the judge 's powers may be shared with a jury . In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation , a judge might also be an examining magistrate",
  "/wiki/State_senator": "A state senator is a member of a state 's senate , the upper house in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states , or a member of the Nebraska Legislature , as it is unicameral ( i.e . one house ) . There are typically fewer state senators than there are members of a state 's lower house . In the past , this meant that senators represented various geographic regions within a state , regardless of the population , as a way of balancing the power of the lower house , which was apportioned according to population . This system changed in 1963 , when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must apportion seats in both houses according to population . However , the single-member district system remained , and as a result , the State Senates became redundant bodies , as other solutions , such as abolition ( as in Canada ) or switching to statewide proportional representation ( as in Australia ) were not considered . A senator 's job is to represent the people at a higher level than a state representative in the lower house",

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80 % of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50 % . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population",

The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District .
