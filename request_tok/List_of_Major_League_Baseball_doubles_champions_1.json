  "/wiki/Paul_Hines": "Paul Aloysius Hines ( March 1 , 1855 - July 10 , 1935 ) was an American center fielder in professional baseball who played in the National Association and Major League Baseball from 1872 to 1891 . Born in Virginia , he is credited with winning baseball 's first triple crown in 1878 ; the accomplishment was not noted at the time , as runs batted in would not be counted until years later , home runs were rare and home run leadership obscure , and Abner Dalrymple was then erroneously recognized as the batting champion . There is some controversy over whether Hines was also the first player to turn an unassisted triple play , since it was an 8-8-4 Triple Play . Hines probably practiced with the original Washington Nationals or played on its junior team before joining the National Association with that club in 1872 . When the original Chicago White Stockings resumed play in 1874 , the teenage Hines played every game , usually in center field . He remained with the club four seasons , including the inaugural National League championship season of 1876 , and then played eight seasons for the Providence Grays from 1878 to 1885 , spanning that club 's entire major league association , during which the club won two pennants . After the Providence club folded in 1885 , he remained an everyday major league center fielder through two seasons for a new Washington Nationals club and one for the Indianapolis Hoosiers , shifting to first base for a second Indianapolis season in 1889 . He returned to center field with gradually declining playing time for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys , Boston Beaneaters and Washington Statesmen in 1890 and 1891 . His last year in the major leagues was 1891 , but he continued to play baseball in minor leagues . He finished his professional career splitting 1896 between the minor league teams Burlington , Iowa and Mobile , Alabama , at the age of 41 . During the first five NL seasons , from 1876 through 1880 , Hines had more base hits than any other player , and he retired third to Cap Anson and Jim O'Rourke with 1,884 career hits in the majors . He also remained among the top 10 major league career home run hitters as late as 1887",

Including his time in the National Association ( NA ) , he played a record 27 consecutive seasons . Anson was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game . Anson spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs franchise ( then known as the White Stockings and later the Colts ) , serving as the club 's manager , first baseman and , later in his tenure , minority owner . He led the team to six National League pennants in the 1880s . Anson was one of baseball 's first great hitters , and probably the first to tally over 3,000 career hits . His contemporary influence and prestige are regarded by historians as playing a major role in establishing the racial segregation in professional baseball that persisted until the late 1940s . On several occasions , Anson refused to take the field when the opposing roster included black players . Anson may have influenced the most noted vote in 19th-century professional baseball in favor of segregation : a July 14 , 1887 one by the high-minor International League to ban the signing of new contracts with black players . After retiring as a player and leaving the Colts , Anson briefly managed the New York Giants . He ran several enterprises in Chicago , including opening a billiards and bowling hall and running a semi-professional baseball team he dubbed Anson 's Colts . Anson also toured extensively on the vaudeville circuit , performing monologues and songs",

  "/wiki/Fred_Dunlap": "Frederick C. Sure Shot Dunlap ( May 21 , 1859 - December 1 , 1902 ) was a second baseman and manager in Major League Baseball from 1880 to 1891 . He was the highest paid player in Major League Baseball from 1884 to 1889 . He has also been rated by some contemporary and modern sources as the greatest overall second baseman of the 19th century . He earned the nickname Sure Shot for the strength and accuracy of his throws to first base , and was also sometimes referred to in the 1880s as the King of Second Basemen . Dunlap played for the Cleveland Blues from 1880 to 1883 , where he secured his reputation as one of the best players in the game . As a rookie in 1880 , he led the National League in doubles and ranked second in extra base hits . While playing for Cleveland , he also compiled batting averages of .325 and .326 in 1881 and 1883 and led the league in assists by a second baseman and range factor . When the Union Association was formed in 1884 , Dunlap was lured to play for the St. Louis Maroons where he became the highest paid player in baseball . His .412 batting average in 1884 was the highest ever recorded to that time in Major League Baseball and 56 points higher than any other player in the major leagues in 1884 due to the lack of talent in the UA . After three years in St. Louis , Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines and helped that team win the 1887 National League pennant . Dunlap 's baseball career ended in 1891 when he broke his leg sliding into a base . He went into the construction business and bet on the horses in the 1890s",
  "/wiki/King_Kelly": "Michael Joseph King Kelly ( December 31 , 1857 - November 8 , 1894 ) , also commonly known as $ 10,000 Kelly , was an American outfielder , catcher , and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League , International Association , Players ' League , and the American Association . He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters . Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career - in 1887 for the Beaneaters , in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players ' League 's existence , and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers - before his retirement in 1893 . He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run , the hook slide , and the catcher 's practice of backing up first base . In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 , the Old Timers Committee ( now the Veterans ' Committee ) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 . In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator , a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball - and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects - placed stress on the following : Kelly 's hook slide does sound special , and players probably tried to copy it . Also , he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base ( when the usually lone umpire was n't looking ) , at least according to the newspaper record . And , Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose . Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s . At the turn of the century , that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes . Kelly 's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888 , the first autobiography by a baseball player ; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. Jack Drohan . Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career , first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem Casey at the Bat , sometimes butchering it",

From 1883 and 1887 , Williamson held the single-season record for both doubles and home runs . Although his record for doubles was surpassed in 1887 , he held the home run record until 1919 , when it was topped by Babe Ruth of the Boston Red Sox . Statistically , he was one of the best fielders of his era . During the first eight years of his career , he led the league at his position in both fielding percentage and double plays five times , and he also led his position in assists six times . Later , when he moved to shortstop , he again led the league in both assists and double plays . His career was shortened by a knee injury that he suffered in Paris during a world-tour organized by Albert Spalding . After he left organized baseball , his health declined rapidly .
