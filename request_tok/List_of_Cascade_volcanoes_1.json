  "/wiki/Mount_Baker": "Mount Baker ( Lummi : Qw\u00fam\u0259 Kw\u0259lsh\u00e9\u02d0n ; Nooksack : Kweq Smaenit or Kwelsh\u00e1n ) , also known as Koma Kulshan or simply Kulshan , is a 10,781 ft ( 3,286 m ) active glaciated andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the North Cascades of Washington in the United States . Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount Saint Helens . About 30 miles ( 48 km ) due east of the city of Bellingham , Whatcom County , Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field . While volcanism has persisted here for some 1.5 million years , the current glaciated cone is likely no more than 140,000 years old , and possibly no older than 80-90,000 years . Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation . After Mount Rainier , Mount Baker is the most heavily glaciated of the Cascade Range volcanoes ; the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker , 0.43 cu mi ( 1.79 km3 ) is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes ( except Rainier ) combined . It is also one of the snowiest places in the world ; in 1999 , Mount Baker Ski Area , located 9 mi ( 14.5 km ) to the northeast , set the world record for recorded snowfall in a single season - 1,140 in ( 29 m ; 95 ft ) . Mt . Baker is the third-highest mountain in Washington and the fifth-highest in the Cascade Range , if Little Tahoma Peak , a subpeak of Mount Rainier , and Shastina , a subpeak of Mount Shasta , are not counted . Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness , it is visible from much of Greater Victoria , Nanaimo , and Greater Vancouver in British Columbia , and to the south , from Seattle ( and on clear days Tacoma ) in Washington . Indigenous peoples have known the mountain for thousands of years , but the first written record of the mountain is from Spanish explorer Gonzalo Lopez de Haro , who mapped it in 1790 as Gran Monta\u00f1a del Carmelo , Great Mount Carmel . The explorer George Vancouver renamed the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS Discovery , who saw it on April 30 , 1792 .",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice and ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia , known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 , and Vesuvius in Italy , whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , with fewer deaths . The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated . The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars , for example the Zephyria Tholus .",
  "/wiki/Schriebers_Meadow_Cone": "Schriebers Meadow Cone is a small parasitic cone on the southeastern flank of Mount Baker in the U.S. state of Washington . It was formed about 9,800 years ago by the only known Holocene flank eruption of Mount Baker . A basaltic lava flow traveled down the Sulphur Creek valley and across the Baker River valley ; this is the most recent lava flow at Mount Baker . Future eruptions from Schriebers Meadow Cone are unlikely to occur as it is considered a short-lived feature . Schriebers Meadow Cone produced thick dark-reddish-brown to yellowish-red scoria that blankets the sides of the Sulphur Creek valley near and southeast of Schriebers Meadow . Near Schriebers Meadow the scoria deposit is thickest on the north valley wall and it decreases in grain size and thickness within short distances . Within 0.62 mi ( 1.00 km ) of the cone the scoria fragments are as much as 9.8 in ( 25 cm ) in diameter and the deposit is 20 to 39 in ( 51 to 99 cm ) thick ; 3.7 mi ( 6.0 km ) to the northeast the fragments are of sand size and the deposit is no more than 1.2 in ( 3.0 cm ) thick .",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present ( BP ) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology , geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past . Because the present time changes , standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ( epoch ) of the age scale , [ a ] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s . The abbreviation BP has been interpreted retrospectively as Before Physics ; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere , making dating after that time likely to be unreliable . In a convention that is not always observed , many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating ; the alternative notation RCYBP is explicitly Radio Carbon Years Before Present .",
  "/wiki/Glacier_Peak": "Glacier Peak or Dakobed ( known in the Sauk-Suiattle dialect of the Lushootseed language as Tda-ko-buh-ba or Takobia ) is the most isolated of the five major stratovolcanoes ( composite volcanoes ) of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the U.S state of Washington . Located in the Glacier Peak Wilderness in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest , the volcano is visible from the west in Seattle , and from the north in the higher areas of eastern suburbs of Vancouver such as Coquitlam , New Westminster and Port Coquitlam . The volcano is the fourth tallest peak in Washington state , and not as much is known about it compared to other volcanoes in the area . Local Native Americans have recognized Glacier Peak and other Washington volcanoes in their histories and stories . When American explorers reached the region , they learned basic information about surrounding landforms , but did not initially understand that Glacier Peak was a volcano . Positioned in Snohomish County , the volcano is only 70 miles ( 110 km ) northeast of Downtown Seattle . From locations in northern Seattle and northward , Glacier Peak is closer than the more famous Mount Rainier , but as Glacier Peak is set farther into the Cascades and almost 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) shorter , it is much less noticeable than Mount Rainier . Glacier Peak is one of the most active of Washington 's volcanoes . The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch , about one million years ago , and since the most recent ice age , it has produced some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state . When continental ice sheets retreated from the region , Glacier Peak began to erupt regularly , erupting explosively five times in the past 3,000 years . It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods ; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington .",
  "/wiki/White_Chuck_Cinder_Cone": "White Chuck Cinder Cone is a cinder cone near Glacier Peak in Snohomish County of Washington , USA . Located near the headwaters of the White Chuck River , its existence was first reported by Everett Houghland in 1934 . Its elevation is 6,020 ft ( 1,835 m ) . Based on the amount of glacial erosion on the cinder cone , it is probably between 2,000 and 17,000 years old .",
  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments , such as either volcanic clinkers , volcanic ash , or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent . The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single , typically cylindrical , vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders , clinkers , or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical ; with slopes between 30-40\u00b0 ; and a nearly circular ground plan . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit .",
  "/wiki/Dishpan_Gap": "Dishpan Gap is a cinder cone in Chelan County of Washington , USA . Located near Glacier Peak and White Chuck Cinder Cone , its elevation is approximately 5,600 ft ( 1,707 m ) . Known for his creative naming of natural features in the Cascade Range , forest supervisor Albert Hale Sylvester named Dishpan Gap for the presence of a old rusty dishpan discarded by some previous camper .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Rainier": "Mount Rainier ( pronounced : /re\u026a\u02c8n\u026a\u0259r/ ) , also known as Tahoma or Tacoma , is a large active stratovolcano in Cascadia located 59 miles ( 95 km ) south-southeast of Seattle , in Mount Rainier National Park . With a summit elevation of 14,411 ft ( 4,392 m ) , it is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington , and of the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest , the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States , and the tallest in the Cascade Volcanic Arc . Mt . Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world , and it is on the Decade Volcano list . Because of its large amount of glacial ice , Mt . Rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley . About 80,000 people and their homes are at risk in Mount Rainiers lahar-hazard zones .",
  "/wiki/Goat_Rocks": "Goat Rocks is an extinct stratovolcano in the Cascade Range , located between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern Washington , in the United States . Part of the Cascade Volcanoes , it was formed by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the western edge of the North American Plate . The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago . Throughout its complex eruptive history , volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous , mafic activity . The volcano and the surrounding Goat Rocks Wilderness , established in 1964 , are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area . The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife , including marmots , pikas , deer , and elk . Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled , and other activities such as hiking are permitted . The area is rife with minerals and resources , including coal , cobalt , copper , and base metals .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Adams_(Washington)": "Mount Adams , known by some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range . Although Adams has not erupted in more than 1,000 years , it is not considered extinct . It is the second-highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington , after Mount Rainier . Adams , named for President John Adams , is a member of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , and is one of the arc 's largest volcanoes , located in a remote wilderness approximately 34 miles ( 55 km ) east of Mount St. Helens . The Mount Adams Wilderness consists of the upper and western part of the volcano 's cone . The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the Yakama Nation . Adams ' asymmetrical and broad body rises 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) above the Cascade crest . Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents . The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western flank of the mountain .",
  "/wiki/Mount_St._Helens": "Mount St. Helens ( known as Lawetlat'la to the indigenous Cowlitz people , and Loowit or Louwala-Clough to the Klickitat ) is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County , Washington , in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is 50 miles ( 80 km ) northeast of Portland , Oregon and 96 miles ( 154 km ) south of Seattle , Washington . Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat Lord St Helens , a friend of explorer George Vancouver who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century . The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes . This volcano is well known for its ash explosions and pyroclastic flows . Mount St. Helens is most notorious for its major eruption on May 18 , 1980 , the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history . Fifty-seven people were killed ; 250 homes , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways , and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed . A massive debris avalanche , triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 , caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain 's summit from 9,677 ft ( 2,950 m ) to 8,363 ft ( 2,549 m ) , leaving a 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) wide horseshoe-shaped crater . The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles ( 2.9 km3 ) in volume . The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption 's aftermath to be scientifically studied . As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range , Mount St. Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of lava rock interlayered with ash , pumice , and other deposits . The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted .",
  "/wiki/Indian_Heaven": "Indian Heaven is a volcanic field in Skamania County in the state of Washington , in the United States . Midway between Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams , the field dates from the Pleistocene to the early Holocene epoch . It trends north to south and is dominated by six small shield volcanoes ; these shields are topped by small spatter and cinder cones , and the field includes a number of subglacial volcanoes and tuyas . The northernmost peak in the field is Sawtooth Mountain and the southernmost is Red Mountain ; its highest point is Lemei Rock at an elevation of 5,925 feet ( 1,806 m ) . Indian Heaven features both polygenetic and monogenetic volcanic activity ; many of its volcanoes have only erupted once before coming extinct , while others have erupted several times . Approximately 50 eruptive centers lie within the Indian Heaven field , which also has approximately 40 lava flows . The field 's eruptive output totals 14 to 19 cubic miles ( 58 to 79 km3 ) , with sporadic activity taking place for the past 700,000 years . The last volcanic activity in the field produced a large cinder cone , Big Lava Bed , as well as a voluminous lava and scoria flows about 9,000 years ago . Future activity is possible , though the Volcano Hazards Program directed by the United States Geological Survey considers Indian Heaven 's volcanic threat level to be low . The volcanic field is surrounded by the Indian Heaven Wilderness , a protected wilderness area within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest , supporting diverse flora and fauna . The local area has been inhabited by Native American populations for about 10,000 years , and the name Indian Heaven derives from the indigenous name for the vicinity . A popular recreation destination , the wilderness offers a number of trails , as well as more than 150 lakes for fishing , swimming , and boating .",
  "/wiki/Shield_volcano": "A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually composed almost entirely of fluid lava flows . It is named for its low profile , resembling a warrior 's shield lying on the ground . This is caused by the highly fluid ( low viscosity ) lava erupted , which travels farther than lava erupted from a stratovolcano , and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava , building up the shield volcano 's distinctive form .",
  "/wiki/Tumtum_Mountain": "Tumtum Mountain is a small , highly-symmetrical volcanic cone in Washington , United States . Located in northern Clark County at the easternmost end of Chelatchie Prairie , it rises to an elevation of 2,004 feet ( 611 m ) , about 1,400 feet ( 430 m ) above the flat prairie . This Pleistocene dacite lava dome is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , and with an age of only about 70,000 years , Tumtum Mountain is the youngest and westernmost volcano in the Cascades of Washington state .",
  "/wiki/Lava_dome": "In volcanology , a lava dome is a circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano . Dome-building eruptions are common , particularly in convergent plate boundary settings . Around 6% of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming . The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt ( e.g . Semeru , 1946 ) to rhyolite ( e.g . Chaiten , 2010 ) although the majority are of intermediate composition ( such as Santiaguito , dacite-andesite , present day ) The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far . This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways : by high levels of silica in the magma , or by degassing of fluid magma . Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava , most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite . Existence of lava domes has been suggested for some domed structures on the Moon , Venus , and Mars , e.g . the Martian surface in the western part of Arcadia Planitia and within Terra Sirenum .",
  "/wiki/West_Crater": "West Crater is a small lava dome with associated lava flows in southern Washington , United States . Located in Skamania County , it rises to an elevation of 4,131 feet ( 1,259 m ) , and forms part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc . It is also part of the Marble Mountain-Trout Creek Hill volcanic field , a little-known Quaternary volcanic field in the southern Cascades of Washington state . The area can be hiked , and can be accessed by roads in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest . One of 13 volcanic cones in the West Crater-Soda Peaks zone , which covers an area of 39 square miles ( 100 km2 ) , West Crater is part of a monogenetic volcanic field with basaltic to andesitic volcanic edifices that vary from 360,000 years old to 2,000 years old . It has a summit crater with a width of 660 feet ( 200 m ) and a depth of 79 feet ( 24 m ) . West Crater 's lava dome formed on the floor of a glacial cirque , and has a similar size to the lava dome formed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . West Crater has erupted at least two large lava flows within the Holocene epoch , about 8,000 years Before Present , each of which extend about 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) from the volcano . Emplaced into canyons on the sides of the crater , the flows are being eroded by local streams . The lava dome likely formed before the lava flows erupted .",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_field": "A volcanic field is an area of the Earth 's crust that is prone to localized volcanic activity .
