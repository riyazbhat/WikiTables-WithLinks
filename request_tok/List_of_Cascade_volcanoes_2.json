  "/wiki/Boring_Lava_Field": "The Boring Lava Field ( also known as the Boring Volcanic Field ) is a Plio-Pleistocene volcanic field with cinder cones , small shield volcanoes , and lava flows in the northern Willamette Valley of the U. S. state of Oregon . Located 12 miles ( 19 km ) southeast of downtown Portland , the field got its name from the town of Boring , Oregon , which lies just southeast of the most dense cluster of lava vents . The zone became active about 2.7 million years ago , with long periods of activity interspersed with quiescence . Its last eruptions took place about 57,000 years ago at the Beacon Rock cinder cone volcano ; the individual volcanic vents of the field are considered extinct , but the field itself is not . The volcanic field covers an area of about 1,500 square miles ( 3,900 km2 ) , and it has a total volume of 2.4 cubic miles ( 10 km3 ) . This region sustains diverse flora and fauna within its habitat areas , which are subject to Portland 's moderate climate with wide temperature variations and mild precipitation . The highest elevation of the field is at Larch Mountain , which reaches a height of 4,055 feet ( 1,236 m ) . Portland has been a center for trade since it was founded in 1845 and has seen many forms of industry throughout its history , including iron mining , smelting , paper mills , cements , industrial chemical production , and shipyards . The Portland metropolitan area , including suburbs , is one of the few places in the continental United States to have extinct volcanoes within a city 's limits , and the Boring Lava Field plays an important role in local affairs , including the development of the Robertson Tunnel , recreation , and nature parks . Because of the field 's proximity to densely populated areas , eruptive activity would be a threat to human life , but the probability for future eruptions in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area is very low . Boring Lava may also influence future earthquakes in the area , as intrusive rock from its historic eruptions may affect ground movement",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_field": "A volcanic field is an area of the Earth 's crust that is prone to localized volcanic activity . They usually contain 10 to 100 volcanoes such as cinder cones and are usually in clusters . Lava flows may also occur . They may occur as a monogenetic volcanic field or a polygenetic volcanic field",
  "/wiki/Pleistocene": "The Pleistocene ( /\u02c8pla\u026as.t\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n , -to\u028a-/ PLYSE-t\u0259-seen , -\u2060toh- , often colloquially referred to as the Ice Age ) is the geological epoch that lasted from about 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago , spanning the world 's most recent period of repeated glaciations . The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP . Publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period",
  "/wiki/Rocky_Butte": "Rocky Butte ( previously known as Wiberg Butte ) is an extinct cinder cone butte in Portland , Oregon , United States . It is also part of the Boring Lava Field , a group of volcanic vents and lava flows throughout Oregon and Washington state . The volcano erupted between 285,000 and 500,000 years ago . As part of the Boring Lava Field , Rocky Butte is considered an outlier of the Cascade Range . It was also produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate ; it is the core remnant of intrusive rock from a late Pleistocene volcano . The Butte has a calc-alkaline composition and consists of basaltic andesite with olivine phenocrysts . Historically , the mountain was the home of the Rocky Butte Jail , Judson Baptist College , and Hill Military Academy , as well as an extensive Works Progress Administration construction project ; it is also currently the home of a functional but decommissioned beacon - Portland Bible College - and a campus for the City Bible Church . The slopes of Rocky Butte currently support Joseph Hill Wood Park and the Rocky Butte Natural Area , which includes a wide variety of flora and fauna and supports rich forest stands . Located next to Interstate 205 , the Butte is a popular destination for hiking , climbing , and seeing mountains from its summit viewpoint",
  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments , such as either volcanic clinkers , volcanic ash , or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent . The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single , typically cylindrical , vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders , clinkers , or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical ; with slopes between 30-40\u00b0 ; and a nearly circular ground plan . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit",
  "/wiki/Powell_Butte": "Powell Butte is an extinct cinder cone butte in Portland , Oregon , United States . It is part of the Boring Lava Field , which includes more than 80 small volcanic edifices and lava flows in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area . The region around Powell Butte has a cool climate , and the butte and its surroundings feature meadows , rivers , and mixed forests . Powell Butte hosts the Powell Butte Nature Park , which includes about 612 acres ( 2.48 km2 ) of trails for biking , hiking , and horseback riding . Powell Butte lies within historic territory of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon . The land surrounding the butte has been used for an orchard , farming , and scientific research on potatoes . Today two underground reservoirs at the Butte each hold 50,000,000-US-gallon ( 190,000,000 L ) of fresh water as a primary part of the public water system for Portland and much of the surrounding region",
  "/wiki/Mount_Sylvania": "Mount Sylvania is an extinct volcano , part of the Boring Lava Field , on the outskirts of Portland , Oregon . Parts of the mountain are within the cities of Portland , Lake Oswego , and Tigard . Mountain Park , a Lake Oswego suburban development , was built on the mountain in the 1970s . The Sylvania campus of Portland Community College is located on the mountain 's western slopes",
  "/wiki/Mount_Hood": "Mount Hood , called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc . It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is located about 50 miles ( 80 km ) east-southeast of Portland , on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties . In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence , and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America . The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11,249 feet ( 3,429 m ) , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11,240 feet ( 3,426 m ) based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11,239 feet ( 3,425.6 m ) of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range . Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt , though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 % , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as potentially active , but the mountain is informally considered dormant",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice and ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia , known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 , and Vesuvius in Italy , whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , with fewer deaths . The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated . The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars , for example the Zephyria Tholus",
  "/wiki/Olallie_Butte": "Olallie Butte is a steep-sided shield volcano in the Cascade Range of the northern part of the U.S. state of Oregon . It is the largest volcano and highest point in the 50-mile ( 80 km ) distance between Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson . Located just outside the Olallie Scenic Area , it is surrounded by more than 200 lakes and ponds fed by runoff , precipitation , and underground seepage , which are popular spots for fishing , boating , and swimming . The butte forms a prominent feature in the Mount Jefferson region and is usually covered with snow during the winter and spring seasons . Part of a stretch of shield volcanoes in Oregon with an unusually low elevation , meaning they have undergone less erosion over time than surrounding volcanic centers , Olallie has been excavated by glacial erosion on its northeastern flank . Its central volcanic plug has also been exposed . Comparisons of its morphology with Mount Jefferson suggest an age for the butte between 70,000 and 100,000 years ; there is no evidence that it has erupted within the past 25,000 years . Olallie Butte has a steep , conical shape that serves as a transitional morphology between steep , mafic ( rich in magnesium and iron ) volcanoes like Mount McLoughlin and Mount Thielsen and flatter , mafic shields . It is made of basaltic andesite . A Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in 1915 but abandoned in 1967 ; the summit also had a cupola cabin from 1920 until its roof collapsed in 1982 . Olallie gets its name from the Chinook Jargon word klallali , which means berries . Today , the butte lies within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation",
  "/wiki/Shield_volcano": "A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually composed almost entirely of fluid lava flows . It is named for its low profile , resembling a warrior 's shield lying on the ground . This is caused by the highly fluid ( low viscosity ) lava erupted , which travels farther than lava erupted from a stratovolcano , and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava , building up the shield volcano 's distinctive form",
  "/wiki/Mount_Jefferson_(Oregon)": "Mount Jefferson is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc , part of the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon . The second highest mountain in Oregon , it is situated within Linn County , Jefferson County , and Marion County and forms part of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness . Due to the ruggedness of its surroundings , the mountain is one of the hardest volcanoes to reach in the Cascades . It is also a popular tourist destination despite its remoteness , with recreational activities including hiking , backpacking , mountaineering , and photography . Vegetation at Mount Jefferson is dominated by Douglas fir , silver fir , mountain hemlock , ponderosa pine , lodgepole pine , and several cedar species . Carnivores , insectivores , bats , rodents , deer , birds , and various other species inhabit the area . Also known as Seekseekqua by Native American populations , the volcano was named after United States President Thomas Jefferson , and was first ascended by E. C. Cross and R. L. Farmer in 1888 . It sits atop an area of crustal melting , and was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate , forming about 730,000 years ago . Consisting of basaltic andesite , andesite , and dacite , the mountain has been extensively altered by glacial erosion . The surrounding area contains a number of other volcanic features like cinder cones , shield volcanoes , and tuyas ( flat-topped , steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet ) . It has not erupted within the past 20,000 years , and is considered a low threat by the United States Geological Survey . Despite the low chance of future eruptions , many scientists still consider mudflows a major threat at Mount Jefferson",
  "/wiki/Three_Fingered_Jack": "Three Fingered Jack is a summit of a shield volcano of the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon . Formed during the Pleistocene epoch , the mountain consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava and was heavily glaciated in the past . While other Oregon volcanoes that were heavily glaciated - such as Mount Washington and Mount Thielsen - display eroded volcanic necks , Three Fingered Jack 's present summit is a comparatively narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) thick on a generally north-south axis . Radiating dikes and plugs that support this summit have been exposed by glaciation . The volcano has long been inactive and has been highly eroded . Diverse flora and fauna can be found surrounding Three Fingered Jack . The area around the volcano was historically inhabited by the Molala people , one of the indigenous groups in the northwestern United States . Not much is known about their culture , other than that the group fished for salmon and collected berries , fruits , obsidian , and dried herbs . The first person of non-indigenous descent to reach the area was David Douglas in 1825 , followed by Peter Skene Ogden the following year . The first group to ascend the volcano reached its summit in September 1923 . Three Fingered Jack can still be climbed , but when its face becomes foggy , climbers can become disoriented due to the low visibility conditions of climbing the mountain , requiring rescue",
  "/wiki/Hogg_Rock": "Hogg Rock is a tuya volcano and lava dome in the Cascade Range of northern Oregon , located close to Santiam Pass . Produced by magma with an intermediate andesite composition , it has steep slopes and thick glassy margins . Hogg Rock exhibits normal magnetic polarity and is probably about 80,000 years old . Hogg Rock lies south of Three Fingered Jack and north of Hayrick Butte , a somewhat larger tuya of similar age and composition . A tuya is a type of subglacial volcano , formed when lava erupts underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet and then melts through to the surface and pools , producing the flat plateau on top with near-vertical walls along the ice-contact margin as the lava cools and hardens . It is a historic landmark , with the remnants of Colonel T. Egenton Hogg 's Oregon Pacific Railroad , the Santiam Lodge , and a quarry . The mountain offers snowshoe and snowmobile trails , and its summit provides views of the surrounding area including volcanoes like the Black Butte stratovolcano , Mount Washington , Sand Mountain , and Potato Hill",
  "/wiki/Tuya": "A tuya is a type of distinctive , flat-topped , steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet . They are somewhat rare worldwide , being confined to regions which were covered by glaciers and had active volcanism during the same period . Lava that erupts under a glacier cools very quickly and can not travel far , so it piles up into a steep-sided hill . If the eruption continues long enough , it either melts all the ice or emerges through the top of the ice and then creates normal-looking lava flows that make a flat cap on top of the hill . Discovering and dating the lava flows in a tuya has proven useful in reconstructing past glacial ice extents and thicknesses",
  "/wiki/Blue_Lake_Crater": "Blue Lake Crater ( also known as Blue Lake Maar ) is a maar , or a broad , low-relief volcanic crater , in the U.S. state of Oregon . Located in Jefferson County , it consists of three overlapping craters , which hold Blue Lake . The drainage basin for Blue Lake has very steep , forested slopes and is mostly part of the explosion crater left by the volcano 's eruption . The volcano lies within the Metolius River basin , which supports a wide array of plant life , large and small mammals , and more than 80 bird species . In 2009 , Governor of Oregon Ted Kulongoski signed a bill designating the Metolius River basin as an area of critical concern , preventing large-scale development on the land and protecting its wildlife . Despite having erupted at some point within the past 4,000 years , Blue Lake Crater is considered one of the least-known Holocene volcanoes in the Cascade volcanic arc . It forms a modest volcanic cone , its lake surrounded by a crescent-shaped , agglutinate ridge consisting of volcanic bombs . The northern side of Blue Lake Crater 's rim collapsed during eruptive activity , while the southern wall remains intact . The overall composition is mafic ( rich in magnesium and iron ) , chiefly basalt and picrite basalt ( picrobasalt ) . Other associated volcanic features include a chain of spatter cones about 3.7 miles ( 6.0 km ) to the south , which erupted material that shares petrographic qualities with erupted material from Blue Lake Crater . Geologists disagree on the exact date of Blue Lake Crater 's most recent activity ; W. E. Scott and E. M. Taylor place the eruption at 3,440 \u00b1 250 years ago , while more recent publications estimate that date as the maximum age and suggest it is more likely the eruption occurred about 1,330 \u00b1 140 years ago . The United States Geological Survey has assessed the threat potential from Blue Lake Crater as Low/Very Low",
  "/wiki/Maar": "A maar is a broad , low-relief volcanic crater caused by a phreatomagmatic eruption ( an explosion which occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma ) . A maar characteristically fills with water to form a relatively shallow crater lake which may also be called a maar . The name comes from a Moselle Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany . Maars are shallow , flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam ; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme . Maars range in size from 60 to 8,000 m ( 200 to 26,250 ft ) across and from 10 to 200 m ( 33 to 656 ft ) deep ; most maars commonly fill with water to form natural lakes . Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme",

Hoodoo is sometimes considered a subfeature of the Mount Washington shield volcano , and it forms part of the Sisters Reach , which extends from South Cinder Peak to Crane Prairie Reservoir , running for 56 miles ( 90 km ) . This region has a high vent density , with many mafic ( rich in magnesium and iron ) volcanoes of Pleistocene to Holocene age , such as Hoodoo . While Hoodoo has an intact summit crater that was blocked from erosion by glaciers , it has an irregular topography , giving it an open appearance . A ski area , also named Hoodoo , is located on the northwest through northeast flanks of the cone , and includes five chairlifts .

It began approximately 11,650 cal years before present , after the last glacial period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period . The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period , known as MIS 1 . It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch , called the Flandrian interglacial . The Holocene corresponds with rapid proliferation , growth and impacts of the human species worldwide , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present . Human impacts on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species , including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence , or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of human impacts . In July 2018 , the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections , Greenlandian ( 11,700 years ago to 8,326 years ago ) , Northgrippian ( 8,326 years ago to 4,200 years ago ) and Meghalayan ( 4,200 years ago to the present ) , as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy . The boundary stratotype of Meghalayan is a speleothem in Mawmluh cave in India , and the global auxiliary stratotype is an ice core from Mount Logan in Canada",

Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , it lies southwest of Mount Jefferson and northwest of Belknap Crater and Mount Washington . Its highest elevation is 5,463 feet ( 1,665 m ) . Active during the Holocene epoch , the Sand Mountain Field began erupting about 4,000 years ago . The field includes 23 basaltic and basaltic andesitic cinder cones and lava flows , for a total of 42 volcanic vents within two roughly north-south trending alignments . Its total dense-rock equivalent eruptive output is 0.22 to 0.29 cubic miles ( 0.92 to 1.21 km3 ) , with subfeatures including a tephra field and a lava tube system . Future activity is possible , but according to the Volcano Hazards Program of the United States Geological Survey , the threat from the field itself is low . The field lies within the Willamette National Forest near Santiam Pass . It supports some forested areas , which grow well on lava flows with tephra that serves as suitable soil for stands of Douglas fir and western hemlock and less commonly western red cedar . The surroundings represent an area of geological interest , and scoria has been quarried from one of the field 's volcanic cones for highway supplies . Nearby tourist destinations include a ski resort , Tamolitch Falls , and Clear Lake",

Hayrick Butte has a nearly flat plateau about 0.5 miles ( 0.80 km ) across and steep walls rising about 700 feet ( 0.21 km ) above its surroundings . A cartographer accidentally switched the names for nearby Hoodoo Butte and Hayrick Butte ; the word hoodoo usually refers to rock piles and pinnacles like those observed at Hayrick Butte . Compared to Hoodoo , Hayrick is less popular for recreation , though it can be climbed , and there are hiking , snowshoeing , and snowmobile routes surrounding the butte .

Black Butte forms part of the Cascade volcanic arc . The butte lies just south of the Metolius Springs , which merge to form the headwaters of the Metolius River . The Metolius River 's basin sustains a wide array of plant life , large and small mammals , and more than 80 bird species . Black Butte last erupted during the Pleistocene ; geologists have estimated its age at 0.4 , 0.5 , and 1.43 \u00b1 0.33 million years ago . The duration of the eruptions that built the volcano remains unclear , though the activity likely coincided with large-scale block faulting in the vicinity of the Metolius Springs . Black Butte has a prominent volcanic cone and is made up of mafic ( rich in magnesium and iron ) basaltic andesite lava . Despite having a well-preserved , symmetrical shape and an unexposed pyroclastic core , the butte has undergone moderate erosion , with shallow ravines , deep gullies on its sides , and rocks with weathering rinds . A number of cinder cones and a volcanic field also lie nearby the butte . There was a fire lookout ground house on the butte , which was burned down by the United States Forest Service in 2016 .

Made mostly of mafic ( rich in magnesium and iron ) volcanic rock like subalkaline basalt and basaltic andesite , it has a volcanic plug occupying its summit cone and numerous dikes . It is surrounded by other volcanic features such as cinder cones and spatter cones . The volcano 's last eruptions took place from spatter cones about 1,350 years ago , generating basaltic andesite lava deposits . Mount Washington has barren surroundings , which have seen little historical recreational use . A wagon road at McKenzie Pass was built in 1872 , which was later paved during the 1930s . On August 26 , 1923 , the mountain was first ascended by six boys from the neighboring city of Bend .

  "/wiki/Belknap_Crater": "Belknap Crater is a shield volcano in the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon . Located in Linn County , it is associated with lava fields and numerous subfeatures including the Little Belknap and South Belknap volcanic cones . It lies north of McKenzie Pass and forms part of the Mount Washington Wilderness . Belknap is not forested and most of its lava flows are not vegetated , though there is some wildlife in the area around the volcano , as well as a number of tree molds formed by its eruptive activity . Belknap was named for J. H. Belknap , whose father R. S. Belknap developed Belknap Springs . Early routes through the area extended near Belknap and its lava fields , and in the early 20th century , herds of sheep were moved to the two steptoes that lie among the Little Belknap lava flows to graze . The Oregon Skyline Trail , which runs to the west of Belknap 's lava flows , follows paths used by Native American populations , who harvested huckleberries in the area . Today , there are a number of trails that run near Belknap , including ones that extend to Little Belknap and Belknap Crater . Belknap can be seen by tourists at the Dee Wright Observatory , which was built in-part with lava blocks from Belknap Crater . A precise determination for Belknap 's age has not been made , as its early history remains obscure . Belknap has likely been built up by eruptive activity over a long period of time .

  "/wiki/Complex_volcano": "A complex volcano , also called a compound volcano , is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock . They may form due to changes in eruptive habit or in the location of the principal vent area on a particular volcano . Stratovolcanoes can also form a large caldera that gets filled in by a lava dome , or else multiple small cinder cones , lava domes and craters may develop on the caldera 's rim . Although a comparatively unusual type of volcano , they are widespread in the world and in geologic history . Metamorphosed ash flow tuffs are widespread in the Precambrian rocks of northern New Mexico , which indicates that caldera complexes have been important for much of Earth 's history . Yellowstone National Park is on three partly covered caldera complexes . The Long Valley Caldera in eastern California is also a complex volcano ; the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado are formed on a group of Neogene-age caldera complexes , and most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks of Nevada , Idaho , and eastern California are also caldera complexes and their erupted ash flow tuffs .
