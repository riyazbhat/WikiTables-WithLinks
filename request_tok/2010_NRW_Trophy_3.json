  "/wiki/Short_dance": "The short dance ( SD ) was the first segment of an ice dancing competition from the 2010-2011 to the 2017-2018 seasons . It was approved in June 2010 by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) . It merged the original dance ( OD ) and compulsory dance ( CD ) , which were both discontinued . The ISU re-named the short dance to the rhythm dance ( RD ) in 2018 . The SD was composed of two parts : the pattern dance ( formerly known as the compulsory dance ) , which lasted about one minute and could be placed anywhere in the SD , and the creative section , which took up most of the SD . The pattern dance changed each year , and was announced beforehand by the ISU . The ISU also published yearly rule changes . Ice dancers were expected to perform five required elements in their SD : two segments of the pattern dance , one short lift , a step sequence , and a set of twizzles . At first , the duration of the SD was two minutes and 50 seconds ; in 2016 , it was changed to two minutes and 40 seconds . The first SD in international competitions was performed by U.S. junior ice dancers Anastasia Cannuscio and Colin McManus",

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis )",

The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .
