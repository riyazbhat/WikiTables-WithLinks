  "/wiki/CDMA": "Code-division multiple access ( CDMA ) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies . CDMA is an example of multiple access , where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel . This allows several users to share a band of frequencies ( see bandwidth ) . To permit this without undue interference between the users , CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme ( where each transmitter is assigned a code ) . CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards . IS-95 , also called cdmaOne , and its 3G evolution CDMA2000 , are often simply referred to as CDMA , but UMTS , the 3G standard used by GSM carriers , also uses wideband CDMA , or W-CDMA , as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA , as its radio technologies",

LTE is the upgrade path for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks . The different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries mean that only multi-band phones are able to use LTE in all countries where it is supported .

LTE is also commonly known as 3.95G . The requirements were originally set forth by the ITU-R organisation in the IMT Advanced specification . However , due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that WiMAX , Evolved High Speed Packet Access , and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies , ITU later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies . The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be considered IMT-Advanced . To differentiate LTE Advanced and WiMAX-Advanced from current 4G technologies , ITU has defined them as True 4G",

  "/wiki/UMTS": "The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System ( UMTS ) is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard . Developed and maintained by the 3GPP ( 3rd Generation Partnership Project ) , UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology . UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access ( W-CDMA ) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators . UMTS specifies a complete network system , which includes the radio access network ( UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network , or UTRAN ) , the core network ( Mobile Application Part , or MAP ) and the authentication of users via SIM ( subscriber identity module ) cards . The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access ( FOMA ) or 3GSM . Unlike EDGE ( IMT Single-Carrier , based on GSM ) and CDMA2000 ( IMT Multi-Carrier ) , UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations",

  "/wiki/WiBro": "WiBro ( wireless broadband ) is a wireless broadband Internet technology developed by the South Korean telecoms industry . WiBro is the South Korean service name for IEEE 802.16e ( mobile WiMAX ) international standard . By the end of 2012 , the Korean Communications Commission intends to increase WiBro broadband connection speeds to 10Mbit/s , around ten times the 2009 speed , which will complement their 1Gbit/s fibre-optic network . The WiBro networks were shut down at the end of 2018 . WiBro adopts TDD for duplexing , OFDMA for multiple access and 8.75/10.00 MHz as a channel bandwidth . WiBro was devised to overcome the data rate limitation of mobile phones ( for example CDMA 1x ) and to add mobility to broadband Internet access ( for example ADSL or Wireless LAN ) . In February 2002 , the Korean government allocated 100 MHz of electromagnetic spectrum in the 2.3-2.4 GHz band , and in late 2004 WiBro Phase 1 was standardized by the TTA of Korea and in late 2005 ITU reflected WiBro as IEEE 802.16e ( mobile WiMAX ) . Two South Korean telecom companies ( KT , SKT ) launched commercial service in June 2006 , and the tariff is around US $ 30 . WiBro base stations offer an aggregate data throughput of 30 to 50 Mbit/s per carrier and cover a radius of 1-5 km allowing for the use of portable internet usage . In detail , it provides mobility for moving devices up to 120 km/h ( 74.5 mi/h ) compared to Wireless LAN having mobility up to walking speed and mobile phone technologies having mobility up to 250 km/h . From testing during the APEC Summit in Busan in late 2005 , the actual range and bandwidth were quite a bit lower than these numbers . The technology will also offer Quality of Service",
  "/wiki/5G": "5G is the fifth generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks that began wide deployment in 2019 . As with previous standards , the covered areas are divided into regions called cells , serviced by individual antennas . Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy them soon . The frequency spectrum of 5G is divided into millimeter waves , mid-band and low-band . Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor , 4G . 5G millimeter wave is the fastest , with actual speeds often being 1-2 Gbit/s down . Frequencies are above 24 GHz reaching up to 72 GHz which is above the extremely high frequency band 's lower boundary . The reach is short , so more cells are required . Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows , so indoor coverage is limited . 5G mid-band is the most widely deployed , in over 20 networks . Speeds in a 100 MHz wide band are usually 100-400 Mbit/s down . In the lab and occasionally in the field , speeds can go over a gigabit per second",

It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks . The 3GPP specification 38 series provides the technical details behind NR , the RAT beyond LTE . Study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015 , and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017 . While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing , industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard , with the expectation that the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR would occur in 2019"
