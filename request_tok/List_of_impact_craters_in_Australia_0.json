  "/wiki/Acraman_crater": "Acraman crater is a deeply eroded impact crater in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia . Its location is marked by Lake Acraman , a circular ephemeral playa lake about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) in diameter . The discovery of the crater and independent discovery of its ejecta were first reported in the journal Science in 1986 . The evidence for impact includes the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz in shattered bedrock on islands within Lake Acraman . The crater is deeply eroded and its original size must be inferred by indirect means . Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to 85 to 90 kilometres ( 53 to 56 mi ) , while other suggest a smaller size , perhaps only 35 to 40 kilometres ( 22 to 25 mi ) , closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centred . The larger size estimate would imply an energy release of 5.2 \u00d7 106 megatons of TNT . The impact event is estimated to have occurred about 580 million years ago during the Ediacaran ; this age is not derived from the crater itself but from the position of ejecta within nearby sedimentary basins . The Lake Acraman Impact Structure is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register",
  "/wiki/South_Australia": "South Australia ( abbreviated as SA ) is a state in the southern central part of Australia . It covers some of the most arid parts of the country . With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres ( 379,725 sq mi ) , it is the fourth-largest of Australia 's states and territories by area , and fifth largest by population . It has a total of 1.7 million people , and its population is the second most highly centralised in Australia , after Western Australia , with more than 77 percent of South Australians living in the capital , Adelaide , or its environs . Other population centres in the state are relatively small ; Mount Gambier , the second largest centre , has a population of 28,684 . South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states , and with the Northern Territory ; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia , to the north by the Northern Territory , to the north-east by Queensland , to the east by New South Wales , to the south-east by Victoria , and to the south by the Great Australian Bight . The state comprises less than 8 percent of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories . The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide . Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray . The state 's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled , planned British province , rather than as a convict settlement . Colonial government commenced on 28 December 1836 , when the members of the council were sworn in near the Old Gum Tree . [ citation needed ] As with the rest of the continent , the region has a long history of human occupation by numerous tribes and languages",
  "/wiki/Amelia_Creek_crater": "Amelia Creek crater is an impact structure ( or astrobleme ) , the eroded remnant of a former impact crater , located in the Davenport Range , Northern Territory , Australia . It lies within a low range of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks , which are extensively folded and faulted , thus making an eroded impact crater difficult to recognize . It was only discovered by the identification of shatter cones near its centre . The central shatter cone locality is surrounded by a 20 by 12 km ( 12.4 by 7.5 mi ) area of anomalous deformation , the asymmetry being possibly related to very oblique impact , but may be at least partly due to the pre-existing structural complexity of the rocks . This deformed zone gives the best estimate for the original size of the crater . Impact took place after folding of the Paleoproterozoic rocks but before deposition of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian rocks which overlie them , thus constraining the impact event to the interval between about 1660 and 600 Ma",
  "/wiki/Northern_Territory": "The Northern Territory ( NT ; formally the Northern Territory of Australia ) is an Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia . It shares borders with Western Australia to the west ( 129th meridian east ) , South Australia to the south ( 26th parallel south ) , and Queensland to the east ( 138th meridian east ) . To the north , the territory looks out to the Timor Sea , the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria , including Western New Guinea and other Indonesian islands . The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres ( 520,902 sq mi ) , making it the third-largest Australian federal division , and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world . It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining .

  "/wiki/Western_Australia": "Western Australia [ a ] ( abbreviated as WA ) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia . It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 . Today , its economy mainly relies on mining , oil and gas , services and construction",

  "/wiki/Dalgaranga_crater": "Dalgaranga crater is a small meteorite impact crater located on Dalgaranga pastoral station 75 km northwest of Mount Magnet ( or north of Yalgoo ) in Western Australia . It is only 24 m in diameter and 3 m deep , making it Australia 's smallest impact crater ( with exception of the smallest members of the Henbury crater field ) . Though discovered in 1921 , it was not reported in the scientific literature until 1938 . The bedrock at the site is weathered Archaean granite of the Yilgarn Craton . The discovery of fragments of mesosiderite stony-iron meteorite around the crater confirms an impact origin , making this crater unique as the only one known to have been produced by a mesosiderite projectile",

  "/wiki/Glikson_crater": "Glikson crater is an impact structure ( or astrobleme ) , the eroded remnant of a former impact crater , situated in the Little Sandy Desert of central Western Australia . A possible impact structure was first reported in 1997 , and named after Australian geologist A. Y. Glikson , attention to the site being drawn by the presence of a prominent 14 km diameter ring-shaped aeromagnetic anomaly . The area within the ring contains sparse outcrop of uplifted and deformed Neoproterozoic sandstone , but is largely covered by sand dunes . The recent discovery of shatter cones and microscopic shock effects is reliable evidence for an impact origin . Deformation of the sandstone consistent with an impact origin extends out to a diameter of 19 km , which is the best estimate for the original diameter of the original crater . The ring-shaped aeromagnetic anomaly was probably caused by disruption of a horizontal layer of magnetic igneous rock , known as a sill , by the impact event . Nearby outcrops of dolerite have been dated at 508 \u00b1 5 Ma ( Middle Cambrian ) , and if this is the same rock causing the aeromagnetic anomaly , then the impact must be younger , probably of Paleozoic age",
  "/wiki/Goat_Paddock_crater": "Goat Paddock is a 5 km-diameter near-circular bowl-shaped depression in a range of gently dipping Proterozoic sandstone in the Kimberley Region of northern Western Australia , 106 km west-southwest of Halls Creek . It is interpreted as an ancient meteorite impact crater , the evidence including breccia containing melted rocks , silica glass , shatter cones and shocked quartz . Drilling shows that the crater is filled with about 200 m of ancient lake sediments containing Early Eocene pollen , this age thus giving a minimum estimate for the age of the crater itself . The crater is not perfectly circular , but slightly elongated in a north-south direction , suggesting that the projectile struck at low angle from either the north or south",
