  "/wiki/AOLserver": "AOLserver is AOL 's open source web server . AOLserver is multithreaded , Tcl-enabled , and used for large scale , dynamic web sites . AOLserver is distributed under the Mozilla Public License . AOLserver was originally developed by NaviSoft under the name NaviServer , but changed names when AOL bought the company in 1995 . Philip Greenspun convinced America Online to open-source the program in 1999 . AOLserver was the first HTTP server program to combine multithreading , a built-in scripting language , and the pooling of persistent database connections . For database-backed Web sites , this enabled performance improvements of 100\u00d7 compared to the standard practices at the time of CGI scripts that opened fresh database connections on every page load . Eventually other HTTP server programs were able to achieve similar performance with a similar architecture . AOLserver is a key component in the Open Architecture Community System ( OpenACS ) which is an advanced open-source toolkit for developing web applications . In Sept 2007 , a port of AOLserver for the iPhone was made available and later forked under the name Joggame Server . This fork is described on its Sourceforge project page as being a spin-off of AOLserver for devices . NaviServer ( also hosted on SourceForge ) is a fork of AOLserver .",

NaviSoft was acquired by AOL on November 30 , 1994 . Under AOL , the products and hosting service were rebranded AOLpress , AOLserver , and AOL PrimeHost , and AOL continued to offer those products and services through AOL 's Internet Services Company . In 1995 , AOL also acquired the Global Network Navigator ( GNN ) and offered NaviSoft 's products under the GNN brand . as well . AOL eventually stopped offering the WYSIWYG HTML authoring tool and web hosting services , but they continued to use AOLServer internally to run AOL 's web services . In 1999 , AOL released the source code to AOLServer as open-source under the GNU or AOLServer Public License .

It has undergone two revisions , a minor update to version 1.1 , and a major update to version 2.0 with the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses .

The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

In August 1995 , NCSA HTTPd powered most of all web servers on the Internet ; nearly all of them quickly switched over to Apache .

He wrote the first version while he was an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , where he was working with the original NCSA Mosaic team . His twin brother , Mike , also attended the university and would join the Mosaic team to work on a port of the Mosaic software to the Macintosh computer . The brothers received their bachelor 's degrees from the university in 1995 . They went to high school at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy ( class of 1991 ) and Robert was awarded its Alumni Trailblazer Award at its inaugural award event during its 20th anniversary celebration on April 20 , 2007 . One of Robert McCool 's many contributions was in drafting the initial specification of the Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) , in collaboration with others on the www-talk mailing list , and providing a reference implementation of CGI in version 1.0 of the NCSA HTTPd web server . The CGI specification , introduced in December 1993 , turned out to be a key element in making the World Wide Web dynamic and interactive .
