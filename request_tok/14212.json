  "/wiki/Aula_Regia": "An aula regia ( lat . for royal hall ) , also referred to as a palas hall , is a name given to the great hall in an imperial or royal palace ( German Kaiserpfalz ) . In the Middle Ages the term was also used as a synonym for the Pfalz itself . An example of a surviving , former Visigothic aula regia is the church of Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco near Oviedo , built around 850 as an aula regia for Ramiros I . There was also an aula regia in the Palace of Aachen\u02d0 it later became a part of the medieval Town Hall of Aachen . The royal hall of the Kaiserpfalz at Ingelheim has been digitally reconstructed . The architectural prototype for all of them was the Basilica of Constantine in Trier .

  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

  "/wiki/Augustus": "Augustus ( Latin : Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus ; [ nb 1 ] 23 September 63 BC - 19 August AD 14 ) was a Roman statesman and military leader who became the first emperor of the Roman Empire , reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14 . [ nb 2 ] His status as the founder of the Roman Principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history . The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors over the imperial succession . Augustus was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia . His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Octavius was named in Caesar 's will as his adopted son and heir . Along with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus , he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar . Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi , the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators . The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC . After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic .",
  "/wiki/Diribitorium": "The diribitorium was a public voting hall situated on the campus Martius in Ancient Rome .

Its roof had the widest span of any building erected in Rome before 230 A.D. , and was supported by beams of larch one hundred feet long and one and a half feet thick . According to Cassius Dio , the diribitorium was among a number of public buildings that were destroyed by fire in 80 AD , and subsequently rebuilt by emperor Titus .

Founded by the Celts in the late 4th century BC as Treuorum and conquered 300 years later by the Romans , who renamed it Augusta Treverorum ( The City of Augustus among the Treveri ) , Trier has a good title for being considered Germany 's oldest city . It is also the oldest seat north of the Alps of a bishop . In the Middle Ages , the archbishop-elector of Trier was an important prince of the Church who controlled land from the French border to the Rhine .

Pompeii , along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area ( e.g . at Boscoreale , Stabiae ) , was buried under 4 to 6 m ( 13 to 20 ft ) of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 . Largely preserved under the ash , the excavated city offers a unique snapshot of Roman life , frozen at the moment it was buried and providing an extraordinarily detailed insight into the everyday life of its inhabitants . It was a wealthy town , enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations , furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators . Organic remains , including wooden objects and human bodies , were entombed in the ash and decayed leaving voids which archaeologists found could be used as moulds to make plaster casts of unique and often gruesome figures in their final moments of life . The numerous graffiti carved on the walls and inside rooms provide a wealth of examples of the largely lost Vulgar Latin spoken colloquially at the time , contrasting with the formal language of the classical writers . Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy , with approximately 2.5 million visitors annually . After many excavations prior to 1960 that had uncovered most of the city but left it in decay , further major excavations were banned and instead they were limited to targeted , prioritised areas .

The main entrance for spectators was originally on the south side of the building , with access from the terrace of the Middle Stoa . The north facade only had a small portico to give access to the stage . Unfortunately the 25 metres ( 82 ft ) of the auditorium eventually caused the roof to collapse in around 150 CE . The Odeon was rebuilt as a smaller lecture hall , seating only 500 and a more elaborate facade was added to the north side . Its massive pillars were carved in the form of 'giants ' ( snake tails ) and 'tritons ' ( fish tails ) . The Odeon was finally destroyed in 267 CE by the Herulians .",

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world 's oldest cities , with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC . Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus . A center for the arts , learning and philosophy , home of Plato 's Academy and Aristotle 's Lyceum , it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy , largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent , and in particular the Romans .

From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century B.C. , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire , which adopted the Greek language and culture .",

The columns and the walls were of precious marbles ; the 50 meter ( 164 ft ) high roof was covered by gilded bronze tiles . The many rows of columns separating the side aisles are a traditional means of structure for basilicas . This method of structure can be traced back to Egyptian hypostyle Halls .",
