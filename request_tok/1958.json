It lies on the river Labe 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) east of Prague on the D11 highway . It obtained the status of town from the king of Bohemia in 1472 . A historic milestone in the life of the town was the year 1905 , when it was visited by the German estate owner Prince von B\u00fclow . This well-known water diviner found in the inner courtyard of the castle signs of a strong spring , which was later bored to a depth of 97.6 metres ( 320 ft ) . The discovery of carbonic mineral water resulted in the opening of the first spa in 1908 . After World War I Pod\u011bbrady rapidly changed into a spa town which from 1926 specialized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases , rapidly gaining renown not only in the Czech Republic , but also abroad in countries including Austria , Germany , Russia and the United States . The history of Pod\u011bbrady reaches back to medieval times . A long-distance trade route running from Prague to eastern Bohemia and then on to Silesia and Poland passed through the then-forested landscape interwoven with a dense network of river branches . This important communication intersected the River Labe to the west of the present town , at a place called Na Vinici . An ancient community and a small fortress originated near the ford .
