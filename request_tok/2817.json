Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542 , Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain , forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later . The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 , founded in 1769 , formed the first European settlement in what is now California . In 1821 , San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire , which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later . California became part of the United States in 1848 following the Mexican-American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850 . The city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic center of the region as well as the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area .

  "/wiki/Pregnant": "Pregnancy , also known as gestation , is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman . A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring , such as with twins . Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology . A pregnancy may end in a live birth , abortion , or miscarriage , though access to safe abortion care varies globally . Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) . This is just over nine months , where each month averages 31 days . When measured from fertilization it is about 38 weeks . An embryo is the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization , after which , the term fetus is used until birth . Symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods , tender breasts , nausea and vomiting , hunger , and frequent urination . Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test . Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters , each lasting for approximately 3 months . The first trimester includes conception , which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg .",
  "/wiki/Abortion": "Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus . [ note 1 ] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion . When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently induced miscarriage . The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion . A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a late termination of pregnancy or less accurately as a late term abortion . When properly done , abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths . It is safer than childbirth , which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States . Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions . The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy . The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device . Birth control , such as the pill or intrauterine devices , can be used immediately following abortion .",
  "/wiki/Self-mutilation": "Self-harm , also known as self-injury , is defined as the intentional , direct injuring of body tissue , done without the intent to commit suicide . Other terms such as cutting and self-mutilation have been used for any self-harming behavior regardless of suicidal intent . The most common form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one 's skin . Other forms include behaviour such as burning , scratching , or hitting body parts . While older definitions included behaviour such as interfering with wound healing , excessive skin picking ( dermatillomania ) , hair pulling ( trichotillomania ) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects as self-harm , in current terminology those are differentiated from the term self-harm . Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect . Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm , the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex , as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening . There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40-60 % of suicides . However , generalising individuals who self-harm to be suicidal is , in the majority of cases , inaccurate . The desire to self-harm is a common symptom of some personality disorders . People with other mental disorders may also self-harm , including those with depression , anxiety disorders , substance abuse , eating disorders , post-traumatic stress disorder , schizophrenia , and dissociative disorders . Studies also provide strong support for a self-punishment function , and modest evidence for anti-dissociation , interpersonal-influence , anti-suicide , sensation-seeking , and interpersonal boundaries functions .",

  "/wiki/Valedictorian": "Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States , Canada , Philippines , and Armenia , ( and elsewhere in limited number of schools ) for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony ( called a valediction ) . The chosen valedictorian is traditionally the student with the highest ranking ( highest Grade Point Average , or GPA ) among their graduating class . The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin vale dicere ( to say farewell ) , historically rooted in the valedictorian 's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas . The valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates , before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating . In Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Ireland and India the title valedictorian is not used frequently . In Australia , the title is sometimes awarded to a member of a graduating university class on the basis of contribution to the school rather than academic success . The highest-ranking student in a graduating class is often referred to as dux ( Latin for leader ) , and may or may not give a speech .

  "/wiki/Bachelor's_degree": "A bachelor 's degree ( from Middle Latin baccalaureus ) or baccalaureate ( from Modern Latin baccalaureatus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years ( depending on institution and academic discipline ) . In some institutions and educational systems , some bachelor 's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed . In countries with qualifications frameworks , bachelor 's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework ( sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor 's degrees are considered separately ) , although some qualifications titled bachelor 's degrees may be at other levels ( e.g. , MBBS ) and some qualifications with non-bachelor 's titles may be classified as bachelor 's degrees ( e.g . the Scottish MA and Canadian MD ) . The term bachelor in the 12th century referred to a knight bachelor , who was too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner . By the end of the 13th century , it was also used by junior members of guilds or universities . By folk etymology or wordplay , the word baccalaureus came to be associated with bacca lauri ( laurel berry ) in reference to laurels being awarded for academic success or honours . Under the British system , and those influenced by it , undergraduate academic degrees are differentiated between honours degrees ( sometimes denoted by the addition of ( Hons ) after the degree abbreviation ) and non-honours degrees ( known variously as pass degrees , ordinary degrees or general degrees ) . An honours degree generally requires a higher academic standard than a pass degree , and in some systems an additional year of study beyond the non-honours bachelor 's . Some countries , such as Australia , New Zealand and Canada , have a postgraduate bachelor with honours degree . This may be taken as a consecutive academic degree , continuing on from the completion of a bachelor 's degree program in the same field , or as part of an integrated honours program . Programs like these typically require completion of a full-year long research thesis project .",

It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant of the phenethylamine class . By salt content , the active ingredients are 25 % levoamphetamine salts ( the levorotatory or 'left-handed ' enantiomer ) and 75 % dextroamphetamine salts ( the dextrorotatory or 'right-handed ' enantiomer ) . [ note 2 ] [ sources 1 ] Adderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy . At therapeutic doses , Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . At these doses , it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time , fatigue resistance , and increased muscle strength . In contrast , much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control , cause rapid muscle breakdown , or induce a psychosis ( e.g. , delusions and paranoia ) . The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals , but most commonly include insomnia , dry mouth , and loss of appetite . The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses , such as those used for treating ADHD ; however , the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses . Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses , and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects .",

  "/wiki/Threesome": "In human sexuality , a threesome is any sexual activity that involves three people at the same time . Though threesome is most commonly applied to a casual sexual activity involving sexual activity among three participants , a threesome may also be found in a long-term domestic relationship , such as polyamory or a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois . A threesome is a form of group sex , but involving only three people . It may occur more frequently in private situations , such as spontaneous sexual activity among three friends , or arranged in a community of like-minded swingers or planned as a once-only experience ; and rarely in anonymous settings , such as at orgies or other sex parties . Among swinging couples , one of the two partners is often the driving force and the other is more passive-supportive of the addition of additional sex parties . [ citation needed ] Some couples use a threesome as a way to develop a love triangle ( m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois ) . A threesome is a common element of sexual fantasy , and it is commonly depicted in pornography ."
