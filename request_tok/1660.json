  "/wiki/North_Atlantic_right_whale": "The North Atlantic right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis , which means good , or true , whale of the ice ) is a baleen whale , one of three right whale species belonging to the genus Eubalaena , all of which were formerly classified as a single species . Because of their docile nature , their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors , their tendencies to stay close to the coast , and their high blubber content ( which makes them float when they are killed , and which produced high yields of whale oil ) , right whales were once a preferred target for whalers . At present , they are among the most endangered whales in the world , and they are protected under the U.S . Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act and Canada 's Species at Risk Act . There are about 400 individuals in existence in the western North Atlantic Ocean - they migrate between feeding grounds in the Labrador Sea and their winter calving areas off Georgia and Florida , an ocean area with heavy shipping traffic . In the eastern North Atlantic , on the other hand - with a total population reaching into the low teens at most - scientists believe that they may already be functionally extinct . Vessel strikes and entanglement in fixed fishing gear , which together account for nearly half of all North Atlantic right whale mortality since 1970 , are their two greatest threats to recovery .",

  "/wiki/Blue_whale": "The blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale suborder Mysticeti . Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters ( 98 feet ) and weight of 177 tonnes ( 190 tons ) , it is the largest animal known to have ever existed . The blue whales long and slender body can be various shades of grayish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath . There are currently five subspecies of blue whale , recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy 's Committee on Taxonomy : B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific , B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean , B. m. brevicauda ( the pygmy blue whale ) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean , B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean , and B. m. unnamed subsp . in the waters off Chile . The blue whale diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids ( krill ) . Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the end of the 19th century . They were hunted almost to extinction by whaling until the International Whaling Commission banned all hunting of blue whales in 1967 . The International Whaling Commission catch database estimates that 382,595 blue whales were caught between 1868 and 1978 . The global blue whale population abundance is estimated to be 10,000-25,000 blue whales , roughly 3-11 % of the population size estimated in 1911 . There remain only much smaller concentrations in the Eastern North Pacific ( 1,647 ) , Central North Pacific ( 63-133 ) , North Atlantic ( 1000-2,000 ) , Antarctic ( 2,280 ) , New Zealand ( 718 ) , Northern Indian Ocean ( 270 ) , and Chile ( 570-760 ) .",

They include what is believed to be the largest animal that has ever lived , the blue whale , which can reach 180 tonnes ( 200 short tons ) , and the fin whale , which reaches 120 tonnes ( 130 short tons ) ; even the smallest of the group , the northern minke whale , reaches 9 tonnes ( 9.9 short tons ) . Rorquals take their name from French rorqual , which derives from the Norwegian word r\u00f8yrkval , meaning rorqual-whale ( the first element r\u00f8yr originated from the Old Norse name for this type of whale , rey\u00f0r , probably related to the Norse word for red ) . The family name Balaenopteridae is from the type genus , Balaenoptera .",
  "/wiki/Fin_whale": "The fin whale ( Balaenoptera physalus ) , also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale , is a cetacean belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales . It is the second-largest species on Earth after the blue whale . The largest reportedly grow to 27.3 m ( 89.6 ft ) long with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 m ( 85 ft ) , a maximum recorded weight of nearly 74 tonnes ( 73 long tons ; 82 short tons ) , and a maximum estimated weight of around 114 tonnes ( 112 long tons ; 126 short tons ) . American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful , slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship . The fin whale 's body is long and slender , coloured brownish-grey with a paler underside . The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order , which includes all species of whale , dolphin , and porpoise . At least two recognized subspecies exist , in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere . It is found in all the major oceans , from polar to tropical waters . It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean . The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters . Its food consists of small schooling fish , squid , and crustaceans including copepods and krill . Like all other large whales , the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Sei_whale": "The sei whale ( /\u02c8se\u026a/ , Balaenoptera borealis ) is a baleen whale , the third-largest rorqual after the blue whale and the fin whale . It inhabits most oceans and adjoining seas , and prefers deep offshore waters . It avoids polar and tropical waters and semienclosed bodies of water . The sei whale migrates annually from cool , subpolar waters in summer to temperate , subtropical waters in winter with a lifespan of 70 years . Reaching 19.5 m ( 64 ft ) long and weighing as much as 28 t ( 28 long tons ; 31 short tons ) , the sei whale consumes an average of 900 kg ( 2,000 lb ) of food every day ; its diet consists primarily of copepods , krill , and other zooplankton . It is among the fastest of all cetaceans , and can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h ( 31 mph ) ( 27 knots ) over short distances . The whale 's name comes from the Norwegian word for pollock , a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale . Following large-scale commercial whaling during the late 19th and 20th centuries , when over 255,000 whales were killed , the sei whale is now internationally protected , although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan . As of 2008 [ update ] , its worldwide population was about 80,000 , less than a third of its prewhaling population .",

The complex means the number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive information and research . The common Bryde 's whale ( Balaenoptera brydei , Olsen , 1913 ) is a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters , and the Sittang or Eden 's whale ( B. edeni , Anderson , 1879 ) is a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific . And also , a smaller , coastal form of B. brydei is found off southern Africa , and perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific differs in skull morphology , tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde 's whale . The recently described Omura 's whale ( B. omurai , Wada et al . 2003 ) , was formerly thought to be a pygmy form of Bryde 's , but is now recognized as a distinct species . B. brydei gets its specific and common name from Johan Bryde , Norwegian consul to South Africa , who helped establish the first modern whaling station in the country , while B. edeni gets its specific and common names from Sir Ashley Eden , former High Commissioner of Burma ( Myanmar ) . Sittang whale refers to the type locality of the species . In Thailand , locals distinguished Sittang whales that were different from B.edeni , and it is unclear whether Sittang whales were applied for later-classified Omura 's whales by locals .",

It is the smallest member of the rorquals and the second smallest species of baleen whale . Although first ignored by whalers due to its small size and low oil yield , it began to be exploited by various countries beginning in the early 20th century . As other species declined larger numbers of common minke whales were caught , largely for their meat . It is now one of the primary targets of the whaling industry . There is a dwarf form in the Southern Hemisphere . This species is known in the fossil record from the Pliocene epoch to the Quaternary period ( age range : 3.6 million years ago to present day ) .",

One of the larger rorqual species , adults range in length from 12-16 m ( 39-52 ft ) and weigh around 25-30 metric tons ( 28-33 short tons ) . The humpback has a distinctive body shape , with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head . It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors , making it popular with whale watchers . Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes , which they repeat for hours at a time . All the males in a group will produce the same song which is different each season . Its purpose is not clear , though it may have a role in mating by inducing estrous . Found in oceans and seas around the world , humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 km ( 16,000 mi ) each year . They feed in polar waters , and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth , fasting and living off their fat reserves . Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish . Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods , including the bubble net technique . Like other large whales , the humpback was a target for the whaling industry .",
  "/wiki/Sperm_whale": "The sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ) or cachalot [ a ] is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator . It is the only living member of the genus Physeter and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family , along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus Kogia . The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range , and will migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding . Females and young males live together in groups , while mature males ( bulls ) live solitary lives outside of the mating season . The females cooperate to protect and nurse their young . Females give birth every four to 20 years , and care for the calves for more than a decade . A mature sperm whale has few natural predators , although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by pods of killer whales ( orcas ) . Mature males average 16 metres ( 52 ft ) in length but some may reach 20.7 metres ( 68 ft ) , with the head representing up to one-third of the animal 's length . Plunging to 2,250 metres ( 7,382 ft ) , it is the third deepest diving mammal , exceeded only by the Southern elephant seal and Cuvier 's beaked whale . The sperm whale uses echolocation and vocalization as loud as 230 decibels ( re 1 \u00b5Pa m ) underwater . It has the largest brain on Earth , more than five times heavier than a human 's . Sperm whales can live 70 years or more .",

  "/wiki/Dwarf_sperm_whale": "The dwarf sperm whale ( Kogia sima ) is a sperm whale that inhabits temperate and tropical oceans worldwide , in particular continental shelves and slopes . It was first described by biologist Richard Owen in 1866 , based on illustrations by naturalist Sir Walter Elliot . The species was considered to be synonymous with the pygmy sperm whale ( Kogia breviceps ) from 1878 until 1998 . The dwarf sperm whale is a small whale , 2 to 2.7 m ( 6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 10 in ) and 136 to 272 kg ( 300 to 600 lb ) , that has a gray coloration , square head , small jaw , and robust body . Its appearance is very similar to the pygmy sperm whale , distinguished mainly by the position of the dorsal fin on the body-nearer the middle in the dwarf sperm whale and nearer the back in the other . The dwarf sperm whale is a suction feeder that mainly eats squid , and does this in small pods of typically 1 to 4 members . It is preyed upon by the killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) and large sharks such as the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharius ) . When startled , the whale can eject a cloud of red-brown fluid , similar to a squid . Most of what is known of the whale comes from beached individuals , as sightings in the ocean are rare . Many of these stranded whales died from parasitic infestations or heart failure . The dwarf sperm whale is hunted in small numbers around Asia . It is more threatened by ingesting or getting entangled by marine debris .",

Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea , which also includes the porpoises ( Phocoenidae ) and the Monodontidae ( beluga whale and narwhal ) . River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea . Oceanic dolphins range in size from the 5.6-foot ( 1.7 m ) -long and 110-pound ( 50 kg ) Maui 's dolphin to the 31-foot ( 9.4 m ) and 11-short-ton ( 10.0 t ) killer whale , the largest known dolphin . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism ; the males are larger than females . They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers . Though not quite as flexible as seals , some dolphins can travel at 34.5 mph ( 55.5 km/h ) . Most delphinids primarily eat fish , along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans , but some species specialise in eating squid , or , in the case of the killer whale , also eat marine mammals and birds . All , however , are purely carnivorous . They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth , although a few species have considerably fewer .",
  "/wiki/False_killer_whale": "The false killer whale ( Pseudorca crassidens ) is an oceanic dolphin that inhabits oceans worldwide but mainly frequents tropical regions . It was first described in 1846 as a species of porpoise based on a skull , which was revised when the first carcasses were observed in 1861 . The name false killer whale comes from the similar skull characteristics to the killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) . The false killer whale reaches a maximum length of 6 m ( 20 ft ) , though size can vary around the world . It is highly sociable , known to form pods of up to 500 members , and can also form pods with other dolphin species , such as bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) . Further , it can form close bonds with other species , as well as partake in sexual ( including both heterosexual and homosexual ) interactions with them . Conversely , the false killer whale has also been known to feed on other dolphins , though it typically eats squid and fish . It is a deep-diving dolphin , with a maximum recorded depth of 927.5 m ( 3,043 ft ) ; its maximum speed is around 29 km/h ( 18 mph ) . The false killer whale easily adapts to captivity and is kept in several aquariums around the world , though its aggression towards other dolphins makes it less desirable . It is threatened by fishing operations , as it can become entangled in fishing gear . It is drive hunted in some Japanese villages . The false killer whale has a tendency to mass strand given its highly social nature , with the largest stranding consisting of 805 beached at Mar del Plata , Argentina .",
  "/wiki/Killer_whale": "The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . Killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . Some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . They have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales . Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them . A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world 's oceans in a variety of marine environments , from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas , absent only from the Baltic and Black seas , and some areas of the Arctic Ocean . Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups ( pods ) which are the most stable of any animal species . Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours , which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations , have been described as manifestations of animal culture . The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca 's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species . Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion , habitat loss , pollution ( by PCBs ) , capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries . In late 2005 , the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters , were placed on the U.S . Endangered Species list .",
  "/wiki/Short-finned_pilot_whale": "The short-finned pilot whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ) is one of the two species of cetaceans in the genus Globicephala , which it shares with the long-finned pilot whale ( G. melas ) . It is part of the oceanic dolphin family ( Delphinidae ) , though its behaviour is closer to that of the larger whales . It has a worldwide distribution , with a global population of about 700,000 , and there may be 3 or 4 distinct populations-two in the Pacific , and one in The Atlantic and Indian Oceans . Its range is moving northward due to global warming . In the Pacific , males average 4-6 m ( 13-20 ft ) , and females 3-5 m ( 9.8-16.4 ft ) . It generally has a stocky build with black to dark gray/brown skin , and can be distinguished from its counterpart by shorter flippers , fewer teeth , and a shorter beak . They are though to pursue fast-moving squid typically at a depth of 700 m ( 2,300 ft ) , but the maximum recorded depth is 1,018 m ( 3,340 ft ) . The short-finned pilot whale has been reported as being highly playful and social . It typically travels in pods of 10-30 members , typically family , but has been observed moving in groups of several hundred . Like killer whales , it has a matrilineal social hierarchy with an elder female at the head , and a sizable post-reproductive lifespan . It is polygynous , and females often outnumber males 8:1 in a pod . Pods are known to mass strand , possibly due to sheer accident , geomagnetic anomalies affected biosonar , injury from loud military sonar , or disease .",
