  "/wiki/University_of_Cambridge": "The University of Cambridge ( legally The Chancellor , Masters , and Scholars of the University of Cambridge ) is a collegiate public research university in Cambridge , United Kingdom . Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by King Henry III in 1231 , Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world 's fourth-oldest surviving university . The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople . The two 'ancient universities ' share many common features and are often referred to jointly as 'Oxbridge ' . The academic standards , history , influence and wealth of the University of Cambridge has made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world . Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 semi-autonomous constituent Colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools . Cambridge University Press , a department of the university , is the world 's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world . Cambridge Assessment , also a department of the university , is one of the world 's leading examining bodies and provides assessment to over eight million learners globally every year . The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums , including the Fitzwilliam Museum , as well as a botanic garden . Cambridge 's libraries , of which there are over 100 , hold a total of around 16 million books , around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library , a legal deposit library . The university is home to , but independent of , the Cambridge Union - the world 's oldest debating society .

  "/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford": "Merton College ( in full : The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England . Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton , chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I , first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it . An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced . The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century . Mob Quad , one of Merton 's quadrangles , was constructed between 1288 and 1378 , and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford , while Merton College Library , located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373 , is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world . Like many of Oxford 's colleges , Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 , after over seven centuries as an institution for men only . Notable alumni and academics past and present include four Nobel laureates and writer J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959 . Merton is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford and held funds totalling \u00a3272 million as of July 2017 .

  "/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Geometry": "The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619 . It was founded ( at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy ) by Sir Henry Savile , a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College , Oxford , and Provost of Eton College , reacting to what has been described by one 20th-century mathematician as the wretched state of mathematical studies in England at that time . He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor . Edward Titchmarsh ( professor 1931-63 ) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry , and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment , although the title of the chair was not changed . The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College , Oxford since the late 19th century . Before then , for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century , the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane . There have been 20 professors ; Frances Kirwan , the current ( as of 2019 [ update ] ) and first female holder of the chair , was appointed in 2017 . The post has been held by a number of distinguished mathematicians . Briggs helped to develop the common logarithm , described as one of the most useful systems for mathematics . The third professor , John Wallis , introduced the use of \u221e { \\displaystyle \\infty } for infinity , and was regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time . Both Edmond Halley , who successfully predicted the return of the comet named in his honour , and his successor Nathaniel Bliss held the post of Astronomer Royal in addition to the professorship . Stephen Rigaud ( professor 1810-27 ) has been called the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation .",

He is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution , best known for his laws of planetary motion , and his books Astronomia nova , Harmonices Mundi , and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae . These works also provided one of the foundations for Newton 's theory of universal gravitation . Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz , where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg . Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague , and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II . He also taught mathematics in Linz , and was an adviser to General Wallenstein . Additionally , he did fundamental work in the field of optics , invented an improved version of the refracting ( or Keplerian ) telescope , and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei . He was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome . Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology , but there was a strong division between astronomy ( a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts ) and physics ( a branch of natural philosophy ) . Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work , motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason . Kepler described his new astronomy as celestial physics , as an excursion into Aristotle 's Metaphysics , and as a supplement to Aristotle 's On the Heavens , transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics .",

Its name is derived from the Greek word \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Seirios glowing or scorching . With a visual apparent magnitude of \u22121.46 , Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus , the next brightest star . Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1 , termed Sirius A , and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2 , termed Sirius B . The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years . Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System . At a distance of 2.64 parsecs ( 8.6 ly ) , the Sirius system is one of Earth 's nearest neighbours . Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System , so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years . After that time , its distance will begin to increase , and it will become fainter , but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth 's night sky for the next 210,000 years . Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ( M\u2609 ) and has an absolute visual magnitude of +1.42 . It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel . The system is between 200 and 300 million years old .",

In its narrowest sense , it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria , which included present-day Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . In its widest historical sense , the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands ; that is , it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores , extending from Greece to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya . The term entered English in the late 15th century from French . It derives from the Italian Levante , meaning rising , implying the rising of the sun in the east , and is broadly equivalent to the term al-Mashriq ( Arabic : \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0642 , [ \u0294al.ma\u0283.riq ] ) , meaning the eastern place , where the sun rises . In the 13th and 14th centuries , the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean , including Greece , Anatolia , Syria-Palestine , and Egypt , that is , the lands east of Venice . Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt . In 1581 , England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire . The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I . This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , and Cyprus . Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon . Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references .",

Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England .

A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

The Copernican model displaced the geocentric model of Ptolemy that had prevailed for centuries , which had placed Earth at the center of the Universe . Copernican heliocentrism is often regarded as the launching point to modern astronomy and the Scientific Revolution . Copernicus was aware that the ancient Greek Aristarchus had already proposed a heliocentric theory , and cited him as a proponent of it in a reference that was deleted before publication ; however , there is no evidence that Copernicus had knowledge of , or access to , the specific details of Aristarchus ' theory . Although he had circulated an outline of his own heliocentric theory to colleagues sometime before 1514 , he did not decide to publish it until he was urged to do so late in his life by his pupil Rheticus . Copernicus 's challenge was to present a practical alternative to the Ptolemaic model by more elegantly and accurately determining the length of a solar year while preserving the metaphysical implications of a mathematically ordered cosmos . Thus , his heliocentric model retained several of the Ptolemaic elements , causing inaccuracies such as the planets ' circular orbits , epicycles , and uniform speeds , while at the same time introducing such innovative ideas as :",

He was accorded responsibility for rebuilding 52 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666 , including what is regarded as his masterpiece , St Paul 's Cathedral , on Ludgate Hill , completed in 1710 . The principal creative responsibility for a number of the churches is now more commonly attributed to others in his office , especially Nicholas Hawksmoor . Other notable buildings by Wren include the Royal Naval College , Greenwich , and the south front of Hampton Court Palace . The Wren Building , the main building at the College of William and Mary , Virginia , is attributed to Wren .

He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time . He is particularly known for An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language ( 1668 ) in which , amongst other things , he proposed a universal language and an integrated system of measurement , similar to the metric system . Wilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy , yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes ; he was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible , and toleration for the rest . Gilbert Burnet called him the wisest clergyman I ever knew . He was a lover of mankind , and had a delight in doing good .

  "/wiki/Saturn": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System , after Jupiter . It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth . It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth ; however , with its larger volume , Saturn is over 95 times more massive . Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture ; its astronomical symbol ( \u2644 ) represents the god 's sickle . Saturn 's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock ( silicon and oxygen compounds ) . This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium , and finally a gaseous outer layer . Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere . An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn 's planetary magnetic field , which is weaker than Earth 's , but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn 's larger size . Saturn 's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter 's . The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast , although long-lived features can appear . Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h ( 1,100 mph ; 500 m/s ) , higher than on Jupiter , but not as high as those on Neptune . In January 2019 , astronomers reported that a day on the planet Saturn has been determined to be 10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s\u2212 1m 19s , based on studies of the planet 's C Ring .",

He is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution , best known for his laws of planetary motion , and his books Astronomia nova , Harmonices Mundi , and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae . These works also provided one of the foundations for Newton 's theory of universal gravitation . Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz , where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg . Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague , and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II . He also taught mathematics in Linz , and was an adviser to General Wallenstein . Additionally , he did fundamental work in the field of optics , invented an improved version of the refracting ( or Keplerian ) telescope , and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei . He was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome . Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology , but there was a strong division between astronomy ( a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts ) and physics ( a branch of natural philosophy ) . Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work , motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason . Kepler described his new astronomy as celestial physics , as an excursion into Aristotle 's Metaphysics , and as a supplement to Aristotle 's On the Heavens , transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics .",

He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father , a tax collector in Rouen . Pascal 's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences , where he made important contributions to the study of fluids , and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli . Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method . In 1642 , while still a teenager , he started some pioneering work on calculating machines . After three years of effort and 50 prototypes , he built 20 finished machines ( called Pascal 's calculators and later Pascalines ) over the following 10 years , establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator . Pascal was an important mathematician , helping create two major new areas of research : he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16 , and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory , strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science . Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli , in 1647 , he rebutted Aristotle 's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum . Pascal 's results caused many disputes before being accepted . In 1646 , he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism . Following a religious experience in late 1654 , he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology . His two most famous works date from this period : the Lettres provinciales and the Pens\u00e9es , the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits .",

  "/wiki/Isaac_Newton": "Sir Isaac Newton PRS ( 25 December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27 [ a ] ) was an English mathematician , physicist , astronomer , theologian , and author ( described in his own day as a natural philosopher ) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution . His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations of classical mechanics . Newton also made seminal contributions to optics , and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus . In Principia , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity . Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , account for tides , the trajectories of comets , the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena , eradicating doubt about the Solar System 's heliocentricity . He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles . Newton 's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis , La Condamine , and others , convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems . Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum . His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks , published in 1704 . He also formulated an empirical law of cooling , made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound , and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid . In addition to his work on calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , developed a method for approximating the roots of a function , and classified most of the cubic plane curves . Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .",

The first professor was Edward Pococke , who was working as a chaplain in Aleppo in what is now Syria when Laud asked him to return to Oxford to take up the position . Laud 's regulations for the professorship required lectures on Arabic grammar and literature to be delivered weekly during university vacations and Lent . He also provided that the professor 's lectures were to be attended by all medical students and Bachelors of Arts at the university , although this seems not to have happened since Pococke had few students , despite the provision for non-attenders to be fined . In 1881 , a university statute repealed Laud 's regulations and provided that the professor was to lecture in the Arabic , Syriac , and Chaldee Languages , and attached the professorship to a fellowship at St John 's College .

  "/wiki/William_III_of_England": "William III ( Dutch : Willem ; 4 November 1650 - 8 March 1702 ) , also widely known as William of Orange , was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth , Stadtholder of Holland , Zeeland , Utrecht , Guelders and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from the 1670s and King of England , Ireland and Scotland from 1689 until his death . Popular histories usually refer to his joint reign with his wife , Queen Mary II , as that of William and Mary . As King of Scotland , he is known as William II . He is sometimes informally known as King Billy in Northern Ireland and Scotland , where his victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 is still commemorated by Unionists and Ulster loyalists . William was the only child of William II , Prince of Orange , who died a week before his birth , and Mary , Princess of Orange , the daughter of King Charles I of England . In 1677 , during the reign of his uncle King Charles II of England , he married his cousin Mary , the fifteen-year-old daughter of Charles II 's brother James , Duke of York . A Protestant , William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic King Louis XIV of France , in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe . Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith . In 1685 , his Catholic uncle and father-in-law , James , became King of England , Scotland and Ireland . James 's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain , who feared a revival of Catholicism .

Although their father James , Duke of York , was Roman Catholic , Mary and her younger sister Anne were raised as Anglicans at the wishes of their uncle , King Charles II . Charles lacked legitimate children , making Mary second in the line of succession . She married her Protestant first cousin , William of Orange , in 1677 . Charles died in 1685 and James took the throne , making Mary heir presumptive . James 's attempts at rule by decree and the birth of his son , James Francis Edward Stuart , led to his deposition in the Glorious Revolution and the adoption of the English Bill of Rights . William and Mary became king and queen regnant . Though William relied heavily on Mary , she wielded less power than William and , when he was in England , ceded most of her authority to him . She did , however , act alone when William was engaged in military campaigns abroad , proving herself to be a powerful , firm , and effective ruler . Mary 's death left William as sole ruler until his own death in 1702 , when he was succeeded by Mary 's sister , Anne .",

The most important mint was in the capital , Edinburgh , which was active from the reign of David I ( 1124-1153 ) , and was the last to close , in the 19th century . Carlisle was probably the first Scottish mint in 1136 . According to Bateson , David I began to mint coins after capturing the city . Mints at Bamburgh and Corbridge in Northumberland , under the control of David 's son Henry , Earl of Northumberland , later returned to English control . Under Alexander III ( 1249-1286 ) there were 16 mints . In the reign of James IV ( 1488-1513 ) , the sole mint was located at Edinburgh . After this time , the only other active mint was at Stirling , where bawbees were minted under Queen Mary . Minting ceased in Scotland in 1709 when the Edinburgh Mint produced its last batch of coins at the end of the 1707-1710 Scottish recoinage , although it retained its permanent officials ( though not other staff ) for a further hundred years , until 1814 . The mint was finally abolished in 1817 and sold in 1830 .

Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere , having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys , deserts , and polar ice caps of Earth . The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth , because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar . Mars is the site of Olympus Mons , the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System , and of Valles Marineris , one of the largest canyons in the Solar System .

  "/wiki/Nebulae": "A nebula ( Latin for 'cloud ' or 'fog ' ; pl . nebulae , nebul\u00e6 or nebulas ) is an interstellar cloud of dust , hydrogen , helium and other ionized gases . Originally , the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object , including galaxies beyond the Milky Way . The Andromeda Galaxy , for instance , was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula ( and spiral galaxies in general as spiral nebulae ) before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher , Edwin Hubble and others . Most nebulae are of vast size ; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter . A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger , but no brighter , from close by . The Orion Nebula , the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the diameter of the full Moon , can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers . Although denser than the space surrounding them , most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth - a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms . Many nebulae are visible due to fluorescence caused by embedded hot stars , while others are so diffuse they can only be detected with long exposures and special filters . Some nebulae are variably illuminated by T Tauri variable stars . Nebulae are often star-forming regions , such as in the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula . In these regions , the formations of gas , dust , and other materials clump together to form denser regions , which attract further matter , and eventually will become dense enough to form stars .",
  "/wiki/Aberration_of_light": "In astronomy , aberration ( also referred to as astronomical aberration , stellar aberration , or velocity aberration ) is a phenomenon which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects about their true positions , dependent on the velocity of the observer . It causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary . The change in angle is of the order of v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the observer . In the case of stellar or annual aberration , the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth 's velocity changes as it revolves around the Sun , by a maximum angle of approximately 20 arcseconds in right ascension or declination . The term aberration has historically been used to refer to a number of related phenomena concerning the propagation of light in moving bodies . Aberration is distinct from parallax , which is a change in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object , as measured by a moving observer , relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame . The amount of parallax depends on the distance of the object from the observer , whereas aberration does not . Aberration is also related to light-time correction and relativistic beaming , although it is often considered separately from these effects . Aberration is historically significant because of its role in the development of the theories of light , electromagnetism and , ultimately , the theory of special relativity . It was first observed in the late 1600s by astronomers searching for stellar parallax in order to confirm the heliocentric model of the Solar System . However , it was not understood at the time to be a different phenomenon . In 1727 , James Bradley provided a classical explanation for it in terms of the finite speed of light relative to the motion of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun , which he used to make one of the earliest measurements of the speed of light .",

  "/wiki/Transit_of_Venus": "A transit of Venus across the Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and a superior planet , becoming visible against ( and hence obscuring a small portion of ) the solar disk . During a transit , Venus can be seen from Earth as a small black dot moving across the face of the Sun . The duration of such transits is usually several hours ( the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes ) . A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon . While the diameter of Venus is more than three times that of the Moon , Venus appears smaller , and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun , because it is much farther away from Earth . Transits of Venus are among the rarest of predictable astronomical phenomena . They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years , with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years . The periodicity is a reflection of the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities . The last transit of Venus was on 5 and 6 June 2012 , and was the last Venus transit of the 21st century ; the prior transit took place on 8 June 2004 . The previous pair of transits were in December 1874 and December 1882 . The next transits of Venus will take place on 10-11 December 2117 and 8 December 2125 . Venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the Solar System .",
  "/wiki/Solar_eclipse": "A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight . This occurs when the Sun , Moon and Earth are aligned . Such alignment coincides with a new moon ( syzygy ) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane . In a total eclipse , the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon . In partial and annular eclipses , only part of the Sun is obscured . If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit , a little closer to the Earth , and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every new moon . However , since the Moon 's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth 's orbit around the Sun , its shadow usually misses Earth . A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon . Special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide because the Moon 's orbit crosses the ecliptic at its orbital nodes twice every draconic month ( 27.212220 days ) while a new moon occurs one every synodic month ( 29.530587981 days ) . Solar ( and lunar ) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons resulting in at least two , and up to five , solar eclipses each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses . Total eclipses are rare because the timing of the new moon within the eclipse season needs to be more exact for an alignment between the observer ( on Earth ) and the centers of the Sun and Moon . In addition , the elliptical orbit of the Moon often takes it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely .",

He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1797 to 1809 . Robertson was born at Duns , Berwickshire , the son of Abraham Robertson , a man of humble station . He attended school at Great Ryle in Northumberland , and later at Duns . At age 24 , he moved to London , he had hopes of travelling to the East Indies , but his patron died . He took himself alone to Oxford , where he sought to finance himself by opening an evening school for mechanics . This failed , and he served for a while as an assistant to James Ireland , a local apothecary . He then gained patronage from John Smith ( 1721 - 1796 ) , the Savilian professor of geometry . Robertson completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1779 and completed his Master in Arts in 1782 . In 1784 , he deputized for Smith , who was then acting as a physician at Cheltenham and then followed Smith as Savilian professor of geometry . His lectures were considered clear , and he was always anxious to encourage his pupils . Thus in 1804 he printed a demonstration of Euclid v , Definition 5 , for the benefit of beginners .",

  "/wiki/Conic_section": "In mathematics , a conic section ( or simply conic ) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane . The three types of conic section are the hyperbola , the parabola , and the ellipse ; the circle is a special case of the ellipse , though historically it was sometimes called a fourth type . The ancient Greek mathematicians studied conic sections , culminating around 200 BC with Apollonius of Perga 's systematic work on their properties . The conic sections in the Euclidean plane have various distinguishing properties , many of which can be used as alternative definitions . One such property defines a non-circular conic to be the set of those points whose distances to some particular point , called a focus , and some particular line , called a directrix , are in a fixed ratio , called the eccentricity . The type of conic is determined by the value of the eccentricity . In analytic geometry , a conic may be defined as a plane algebraic curve of degree 2 ; that is , as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a quadratic equation in two variables . This equation may be written in matrix form , and some geometric properties can be studied as algebraic conditions . In the Euclidean plane , the three types of conic sections appear quite different , but share many properties . By extending the Euclidean plane to include a line at infinity , obtaining a projective plane , the apparent difference vanishes : the branches of a hyperbola meet in two points at infinity , making it a single closed curve ; and the two ends of a parabola meet to make it a closed curve tangent to the line at infinity . Further extension , by expanding the real coordinates to admit complex coordinates , provides the means to see this unification algebraically .",

Although few details of his life are known , he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity . Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time , Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems , including the area of a circle , the surface area and volume of a sphere , and the area under a parabola . Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi , defining and investigating the spiral bearing his name , and creating a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers . He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena , founding hydrostatics and statics , including an explanation of the principle of the lever . He is credited with designing innovative machines , such as his screw pump , compound pulleys , and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion . Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed . Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes , which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder , which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries . Unlike his inventions , the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity . Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him , but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople , while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time . The relatively few copies of Archimedes ' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance , while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results .",

  "/wiki/Stellar_parallax": "Stellar parallax is the apparent shift of position of any nearby star ( or other object ) against the background of distant objects . Created by the different orbital positions of Earth , the extremely small observed shift is largest at time intervals of about six months , when Earth arrives at opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit , giving a baseline distance of about two astronomical units between observations . The parallax itself is considered to be half of this maximum , about equivalent to the observational shift that would occur due to the different positions of Earth and the Sun , a baseline of one astronomical unit ( AU ) . Stellar parallax is so difficult to detect that its existence was the subject of much debate in astronomy for hundreds of years . It was first observed in 1806 by Giuseppe Calandrelli who reported parallax in \u03b1-Lyrae in his work Osservazione e riflessione sulla parallasse annua dallalfa della Lira . Then in 1838 Friedrich Bessel made the first successful parallax measurement , for the star 61 Cygni , using a Fraunhofer heliometer at K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory . Once a star 's parallax is known , its distance from Earth can be computed trigonometrically . But the more distant an object is , the smaller its parallax . Even with 21st-century techniques in astrometry , the limits of accurate measurement make distances farther away than about 100 parsecs ( or roughly 300 light years ) too approximate to be useful when obtained by this technique . This limits the applicability of parallax as a measurement of distance to objects that are relatively close on a galactic scale . Other techniques , such as standard candles and spectral red-shift , are required to measure the distance of more remote objects . Stellar parallax measures are given in the tiny units of arcseconds , or even in thousandths of arcseconds ( milliarcseconds ) .",

Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century , its origins date back to ancient times . The first magnetic compasses were made from lodestones , while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation . The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD . Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox ; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth 's shape , density and gravity field , as well as the components of the water cycle . In the 20th century , geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean , and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics . Geophysics is applied to societal needs , such as mineral resources , mitigation of natural hazards and environmental protection . In Exploration geophysics , geophysical survey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits , locate groundwater , find archaeological relics , determine the thickness of glaciers and soils , and assess sites for environmental remediation .",

The organization of a 5th Canadian Division began in February 1917 but it was still not fully formed when it was broken up in February 1918 and its men used to reinforce the other four divisions . The majority of soldiers of the Canadian Corps were British-born until near the end of the war , when the number of those of Canadian birth who had enlisted rose to 51 percent . They were mostly volunteers , as conscription was not implemented until the end of the war ( see Conscription Crisis of 1917 ) . Ultimately , only 24,132 conscripts made it to France before 11 November 1918 .

  "/wiki/Spectroscopy": "Spectroscopy /sp\u025bk\u02c8tr\u0252sk\u0259pi/ is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation ( via electron spectroscopy , atomic spectroscopy , etc ) . Historically , spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength , by a prism . Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency , predominantly in the electromagnetic spectrum , though matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of radiative energy ; recently , with tremendous difficulty , even gravitational waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) and laser interferometry . Spectroscopic data are often represented by an emission spectrum , a plot of the response of interest , as a function of wavelength or frequency . Spectroscopy , primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum , is a fundamental exploratory tool in the fields of physics , chemistry , and astronomy , allowing the composition , physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be investigated at atomic scale , molecular scale , macro scale , and over astronomical distances . Important applications arise from biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging .",

Keble was established in 1870 , having been built as a monument to John Keble , who had been a leading member of the Oxford Movement which sought to stress the Catholic nature of the Church of England . Consequently , the college 's original teaching focus was primarily theological , although the college now offers a broad range of subjects , reflecting the diversity of degrees offered across the wider university . In the period after the Second World War the trends were towards scientific courses ( proximity to the university science area east of the University Museum influenced this ) . As originally constituted , it was for men only and the fellows were mostly bachelors resident in the college . Like many of Oxford 's men 's colleges , Keble admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 .

  "/wiki/Dark_matter": "Dark matter is a form of matter thought to account for approximately 85 % of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total energy density . Its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysical observations , including gravitational effects that can not be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen . For this reason , most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and that it has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution . Dark matter is called dark because it does not appear to interact with observable electromagnetic radiation , such as light , and so it is undetectable by existing astronomical instruments . Primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many galaxies would fly apart , or that they would not have formed or would not move as they do , if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter . Other lines of evidence include observations in gravitational lensing and in the cosmic microwave background , along with astronomical observations of the observable universe 's current structure , the formation and evolution of galaxies , mass location during galactic collisions , and the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters . In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology , the total mass-energy of the universe contains 5 % ordinary matter and energy , 27 % dark matter and 68 % of an unknown form of energy known as dark energy . Thus , dark matter constitutes 85 % [ a ] of total mass , while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95 % of total mass-energy content . Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly , if it exists , it must barely interact with ordinary baryonic matter and radiation , except through gravity . Most dark matter is thought to be non-baryonic in nature ; it may be composed of some as-yet undiscovered subatomic particles . [ b ] The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of elementary particle that has not yet been discovered , in particular , weakly-interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) . Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken , but none have yet succeeded ."
