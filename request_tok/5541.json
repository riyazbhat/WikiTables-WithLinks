  "/wiki/Acadie\u2014Bathurst": "Acadie - Bathurst ( formerly Gloucester ) is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick , Canada , that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1867 . Until 1997 , the riding was largely held by the Liberal Party thanks to strong support from the francophone Acadian population . There is also a notable Red Tory tendency in the riding that enabled the former Progressive Conservative Party to win on occasion . In the 1997 federal election , the New Democratic Party 's Yvon Godin won an unexpected victory over powerful Liberal cabinet minister Doug Young , mostly due to his Union connections and EI recipients ' reaction to Liberal cuts to Employment Insurance . Godin held the riding until his retirement as of the 2015 federal election , at which point the Liberals reclaimed the riding as part of their sweep of Atlantic Canada .",
