It flows through Oxford ( where it is called the Isis ) , Reading , Henley-on-Thames and Windsor . The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway , derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock . It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire , and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary . The Thames drains the whole of Greater London . Its tidal section , reaching up to Teddington Lock , includes most of its London stretch and has a rise and fall of 23 feet ( 7 m ) . Running through some of the driest parts of mainland Britain and heavily abstracted for drinking water , the Thames ' discharge is low considering its length and breadth : the Severn has a discharge almost twice as large on average despite having a smaller drainage basin . In Scotland , the Tay achieves more than double the Thames ' average discharge from a drainage basin that is 60 % smaller . Along its course are 45 navigation locks with accompanying weirs . Its catchment area covers a large part of south-eastern and a small part of western England ; the river is fed by at least 50 named tributaries . The river contains over 80 islands",
  "/wiki/London_Bridge": "Several bridges named London Bridge have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark , in central London . The current crossing , which opened to traffic in 1973 , is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel .

This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges , the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London . The current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres ( 98 ft ) upstream from previous alignments . The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore . Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729 , London Bridge was the only road-crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames . London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms , in art , literature , and songs , including the nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down . The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates , an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation . It carries the A3 road , which is maintained by the Greater London Authority .

In the 1570s Squirrel made a return voyage from England to Narragansett Bay , piloted by Simon Fernandez . The voyage was considered remarkable given her small size and the dangers of sailing in largely uncharted waters . She was one of a small fleet of vessels under the command of Sir Humphrey Gilbert , commissioned in 1579 by the lord deputy of Ireland , William Drury , to attack James FitzMaurice FitzGerald by sea and to intercept a fleet expected to arrive from Spain . The expedition was a failure with the fleet dispersed by heavy seas and forced to seek shelter at Land 's End . Squirrel was again under Gilbert 's command in 1583 for a voyage to Newfoundland and the north-eastern coast of North America . Departing England in June in company with four other vessels , she made an uneventful crossing of the Atlantic and reached the Newfoundland coast on 5 August . Gilbert went ashore at St John 's to claim the area as England 's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I . Plans for a further expedition south along the American coastline were abandoned following a critical shortage of supplies , and Gilbert elected instead to return to England .

  "/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas_(England)": "The Court of Common Pleas , or Common Bench , was a common law court in the English legal system that covered common pleas ; actions between subject and subject , which did not concern the king . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century after splitting from the Exchequer of Pleas , the Common Pleas served as one of the central English courts for around 600 years . Authorised by Magna Carta to sit in a fixed location , the Common Pleas sat in Westminster Hall for its entire existence , joined by the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench . The court 's jurisdiction was gradually undercut by the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas with legal fictions , the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively . The Common Pleas maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over matters of real property until its dissolution , and due to its wide remit was considered by Sir Edward Coke to be the lock and key of the common law . It was staffed by one Chief Justice and a varying number of puisne justices , who were required to be Serjeants-at-Law , and until the mid 19th century only Serjeants were allowed to plead there . As one of the two principal common law courts with the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload , in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary . Reaching an acceptable medium with the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts ; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction , there was little need for separate bodies , and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice . With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880 , the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist , marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas",

  "/wiki/Marquess_of_Worcester": "Duke of Beaufort , a title in the Peerage of England , was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset , 3rd Marquess of Worcester , a descendant of Charles Somerset , 1st Earl of Worcester , legitimized son of Henry Beaufort , 3rd Duke of Somerset , a Lancastrian leader in the Wars of the Roses . The name Beaufort refers to a castle in Champagne , France ( now Montmorency-Beaufort ) . It is the only current dukedom to take its name from a place outside the British Isles . [ citation needed ] The Dukes of Beaufort descend in the male line from the House of Plantagenet through John of Gaunt , son of Edward III . This statement was challenged after the analysis of the Y chromosomal DNA of the remains of Richard III . Most living male heirs of the 5th Duke of Beaufort were found to carry a relatively common Y chromosome type , which is different from the rare lineage found in Richard III 's remains . The instance of false paternity could have occurred anywhere in the numerous generations separating Richard III from the 5th Duke of Beaufort . The break also could have occurred with Richard III 's grandfather Richard of Conisburgh , whose paternity has been called into question although he was acknowledged by his father . The Beaufort Castle was in possession of John of Gaunt , and the surname Beaufort was given to Gaunt 's four legitimised children by his mistress and third wife , Katherine Swynford . This was the foundation of the House of Beaufort , Dukes of Somerset . A descendant of the Beauforts through his mother was Henry VII of England .
