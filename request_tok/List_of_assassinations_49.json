As a minister of president Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Prieto , Diego Portales played a pivotal role in shaping the state and government politics in the 19th century , delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century . Portales ' influential political stance included unitarianism , presidentialism and conservatism which led to consolidate Chile as a constitutional authoritarian republic with democracy restricted to include only upper class men . While deeply unpopular during his lifetime , the murder of Portales in 1837 during a mutiny has been judged a decisive factor during the War of the Confederation by switching Chilean public opinion to support the war against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation .",

The group was formed by Pablo Rodr\u00edguez Grez [ es ] in 1970 , and turned more and more clandestine throughout the presidency of Salvador Allende . In June 1973 , the group attempted to carry out a coup against the Allende government but failed , in an event known as the Tanquetazo . In July 1973 , it received orders from the Chilean Navy , which opposed the Schneider Doctrine of military adherence to the constitution , to sabotage Chile 's infrastructure . The collaboration between Fatherland and Liberty and the Chilean Armed Forces increased after the failed October 1972 strike which had sought to overthrow Allende socialist administration . In agreement with the sectors opposing Allende in the military , the group assassinated on 26 July 1973 Allende 's naval aide , Arturo Araya Peeters . The first sabotage was committed this same day . Others include creating a power outage while Allende was being broadcast . It was officially disbanded on September 12 , 1973 , following Pinochet 's coup . Members of PyL were then recruited by Chilean security services and participated in the persecution of those opposed to Pinochet 's junta .

Allende 's involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years , having covered the posts of senator , deputy and cabinet minister . As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile , whose foundation he had actively contributed to , he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952 , 1958 , and 1964 elections . In 1970 , he won the presidency in a close three-way race . He was elected in a run-off by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority . On 11 September 1973 , the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace , he gave his last speech vowing not to resign . Later that day , Allende committed suicide with an AK-47 rifle gifted to him by Fidel Castro , according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011 . Following Allende 's death , General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government , and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990 , ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance . The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile , suspended the Constitution , and began a persecution of alleged dissidents , in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed .",

He developed Chilean theater by directing a broad array of works , ranging from locally produced plays to world classics , as well as the experimental work of playwrights such as Ann Jellicoe . He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the Nueva Canci\u00f3n Chilena ( New Chilean Song ) movement . This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President Salvador Allende . Jara was arrested shortly after the Chilean coup of 11 September 1973 , which overthrew Allende . He was tortured during interrogations and ultimately shot dead , and his body was thrown out on the street of a shantytown in Santiago . The contrast between the themes of his songs - which focused on love , peace , and social justice - and the brutal way in which he was murdered transformed Jara into a potent symbol of struggle for human rights and justice for those killed during the Pinochet regime . His preponderant role as an open admirer and propagandist for Che Guevara and Allende 's government , under which he served as a cultural ambassador through the late 60 's and until the early 70 's crisis that ended in the coup against Allende , marked him for death . In June 2016 , a Florida jury found former Chilean Army officer Pedro Barrientos liable for Jara 's murder . In July 2018 , eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 15 years and a day in prison for Jara 's murder .",

  "/wiki/Pinochet_dictatorship": "The military dictatorship of Chile ( Spanish : dictadura militar de Chile ) was an authoritarian military regime that ruled Chile for seventeen years , between September 11 , 1973 and March 11 , 1990 . The dictatorship was established after the democratically-elected socialist government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat on 11 September 1973 . During this time , the country was ruled by a military junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet . The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende 's presidency to justify its seizure of power . The dictatorship presented its mission as a national reconstruction . The coup was the result of multiple forces , including pressure from conservative and womens groups , certain political parties , union strikes and other domestic unrest , as well as international factors . According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative Jack Devine , although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup , subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government . The regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the history of Chile . Overall , the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing , tortured tens of thousands of prisoners , and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile . The dictatorship 's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt . Two years after its ascension radical neoliberal economic reforms were implemented , in sharp contrast to Allende 's leftist policies , advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the Chicago Boys . Later , in 1980 , the regime replaced the Chilean Constitution of 1925 with a new constitution .",

Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after fluid replacement . Sepsis is an inflammatory immune response triggered by an infection . Bacterial infections are the most common cause , but fungal , viral , and protozoan infections can also lead to sepsis . Common locations for the primary infection include the lungs , brain , urinary tract , skin , and abdominal organs .
