Kramer finished the race in a time of 12:54.50 , under the impression that he had won the gold medal in a new Olympic and track record , but was then told by his coach , Gerard Kemkers , that he had been disqualified . Kemkers took the blame for the gaffe , as he had directed Kramer into the inner lane , even when Kramer was attempting to take the correct outer lane . The gold medal instead was won by Lee Seung-hoon in 12:58.55 , edging the existing Olympic record by 0.37 seconds . Despite Lee 's earlier silver medal at the 5000 m race , his achievement was a surprise , since , before 2010 , he had never skated a 10,000 m race under 14 minutes . He broke his personal and the Korean national record , set on 10 January 2010 , by 22.5 seconds .
