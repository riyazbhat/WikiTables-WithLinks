  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40 % of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_Revival": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Greek_cross": "This is a list of Christian cross variants . The Christian cross , with or without a figure of Christ included , is the main religious symbol of Christianity . A cross with a figure of Christ affixed to it is termed a crucifix and the figure is often referred to as the corpus ( Latin for body ) . The term Greek cross designates a cross with arms of equal length , as in a plus sign , while the Latin cross designates a cross with an elongated descending arm . Numerous other variants have been developed during the medieval period . Christian crosses are used widely in churches , on top of church buildings , on bibles , in heraldry , in personal jewelry , on hilltops , and elsewhere as an attestation or other symbol of Christianity . Crosses are a prominent feature of Christian cemeteries , either carved on gravestones or as sculpted stelae . Because of this , planting small crosses is sometimes used in countries of Christian culture to mark the site of fatal accidents , or , such as the Zugspitze or Mount Royal , so as to be visible over the entire surrounding area . Roman Catholic , Anglican and Lutheran depictions of the cross are often crucifixes , in order to emphasize that it is Jesus that is important , rather than the cross in isolation . Large crucifixes are a prominent feature of some Lutheran churches , as illustrated in the article Rood . However , some other Protestant traditions depict the cross without the corpus , interpreting this form as an indication of belief in the resurrection rather than as representing the interval between the death and the resurrection of Jesus . Several Christian cross variants are available in computer-displayed text .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

  "/wiki/Freemasonry": "Freemasonry or Masonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons that from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients . The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds , those of Apprentice , Journeyman or fellow ( now called Fellowcraft ) , and Master Mason . The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry , and entrusted with grips , signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated . The degrees are part allegorical morality play and part lecture . Three degrees are offered by Craft ( or Blue Lodge ) Freemasonry , and members of any of these degrees are known as Freemasons or Masons . There are additional degrees , which vary with locality and jurisdiction , and are usually administered by their own bodies ( separate from those who administer the Craft degrees ) . The basic , local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge . These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level ( usually coterminous with either a state , province , or national border ) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient . There is no international , worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry ; each Grand Lodge is independent , and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate . Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups . Regular Freemasonry insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge , that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being , that no women be admitted ( although , in some jurisdictions , those who transition to women after being initiated may stay ; see below ) , and that the discussion of religion and politics be banned .

In some places , the term standpipe is used interchangeably to refer to a water tower . Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs , which store treated water close to where it will be used . Other types of water towers may only store raw ( non-potable ) water for fire protection or industrial purposes , and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply . Water towers are able to supply water even during power outages , because they rely on hydrostatic pressure produced by elevation of water ( due to gravity ) to push the water into domestic and industrial water distribution systems ; however , they can not supply the water for a long time without power , because a pump is typically required to refill the tower . A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times . The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day , and then a pump fills it back up during the night . This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather , since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled . [ citation needed ]",

Slipforming enables continuous , non-interrupted , cast-in-place flawless ( i.e . no joints ) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements . Slip forming relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete , and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability . Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated ( via vibration ) , yet quick-setting enough to emerge from the form with strength . This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to slip by the concrete without disturbing it , but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery .",

  "/wiki/Dance_hall": "Dance hall in its general meaning is a hall for dancing . From the earliest years of the twentieth century until the early 1960s , the dance hall was the popular forerunner of the discoth\u00e8que or nightclub . The majority of towns and cities in the West had at least one dance hall , and almost always featured live musicians playing a range of music from strict tempo ballroom dance music to big band , swing and jazz . One of the most famous dance hall musicians was Glenn Miller . Other structural forms of dance halls include the dance pavilion which has a roof but no walls , and the open-air platform which has no roof or walls . The open air nature of the dance pavilion was both a feature and a drawback . The taxi dance hall is a dance hall with a specific arrangement , wherein the patrons hire hall employees to dance with them . Starting in the early 1930s , The Savoy , a dance hall in Harlem ( a black neighborhood in New York City ) was the first truly integrated building in the United States - for both the dancers and the musicians . We did n't care about the color of your skin . All we wanted to know was : Can you dance ? The early days of rock n ' roll were briefly played out in dance halls until they were superseded by nightclubs .",

  "/wiki/Prairie_style": "Prairie School is a late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural style , most common in the Midwestern United States . The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H. Allen Brooks , one of the first architectural historians to write extensively about the movement and its work .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/1964_New_York_World's_Fair": "The 1964/1965 New York World 's Fair was a world 's fair that held over 140 pavilions , 110 restaurants , for 80 nations ( hosted by 37 ) , 24 US states , and over 45 corporations to build exhibits or attractions at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens , New York City . The immense fair covered 646 acres ( 261 ha ) on half the park , with numerous pools or fountains , and an amusement park with rides near the lake . However , the fair did not receive official support or approval from the Bureau of International Expositions ( BIE ) . Hailing itself as a universal and international exposition , the fair 's theme was Peace Through Understanding , dedicated to Man 's Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe . American companies dominated the exposition as exhibitors . The theme was symbolized by a 12-story-high , stainless-steel model of the earth called the Unisphere , built on the foundation of the Perisphere from the 1939 World 's Fair . The fair ran for two six-month seasons , April 22 - October 18 , 1964 , and April 21 - October 17 , 1965 . Admission price for adults ( 13 and older ) was $ 2 in 1964 ( equivalent to $ 16.49 in 2019 ) but $ 2.50 ( equivalent to $ 20.28 in 2019 ) in 1965 , and $ 1 for children ( 2-12 ) both years ( equivalent to $ 8.24 in 2019 ) . The fair is noted as a showcase of mid-20th-century American culture and technology . The nascent Space Age , with its vista of promise , was well represented . More than 51 million people attended the fair , though fewer than the hoped-for 70 million . It remains a touchstone for many American Baby Boomers who visited the optimistic exposition as children , before the turbulent years of the Vietnam War and many cultural changes ."
