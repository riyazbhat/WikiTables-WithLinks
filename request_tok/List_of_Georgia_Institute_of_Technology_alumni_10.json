Secondly , it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record , e.g . with or without an index . Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus , SQL consists of many types of statements , which may be informally classed as sublanguages , commonly : a data query language ( DQL ) , [ a ] a data definition language ( DDL ) , [ b ] a data control language ( DCL ) , and a data manipulation language ( DML ) .

Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language , perception , memory , attention , reasoning , and emotion ; to understand these faculties , cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics , psychology , artificial intelligence , philosophy , neuroscience , and anthropology . The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization , from learning and decision to logic and planning ; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization . The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures . Simply put , cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of cognition in humans , animals , and machines . It encompasses the traditional disciplines of psychology , computer science , neuroscience , anthropology , linguistics and philosophy .

Publication of articles in conferences , journals , and books is essential to occupational advancement . As of August 2007 , teaching in tertiary educational institutions is one of the fastest growing occupations , topping the U.S. Department of Labor 's list of above average wages and high projected growth occupations , with a projected increase of 524,000 positions between 2004 and 2014 . In 2011 , a survey conducted by TIAA-CREF Institute senior researcher Paul J. Yakoboski estimated that 73% of professors with senior tenure ranged between the ages of 60 and 66 and that the remaining 27% were above the age of 66 . Yakoboski estimated that 75% of these professors have acknowledged that they have made no preparations for retirement due to the ongoing financial crisis and reluctance to leave their profession . A 2013 survey conducted by Fidelity Investments would echo similar results when the question about retirement came up . In 2013 , the National Center for Education Statistics counted 181,530 professors , 155,095 associate professors , 166,045 assistant professors , 99,304 instructors , 36,728 lecturers , and 152,689 other full-time faculty .",

  "/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University": "The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh by the Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote the time-honored words My heart is in the work , when he donated the funds to create the institution . Carnegie 's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers ( many of whom worked in his mills ) . Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , New York founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887 . In 1912 , the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology ( CIT ) and began offering four-year degrees . During this time , CIT consisted of four constituent schools : the School of Fine and Applied Arts , the School of Apprentices and Journeymen , the School of Science and Technology , and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon ( who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father , Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927 , the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit . In 1937 , the Mellon Institute 's iconic building was completed and it moved to its new , and current , location on Fifth Avenue . In 1967 , with support from Paul Mellon , Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University .

  "/wiki/Ubicomp": "Ubiquitous computing ( or ubicomp ) is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere . In contrast to desktop computing , ubiquitous computing can occur using any device , in any location , and in any format . A user interacts with the computer , which can exist in many different forms , including laptop computers , tablets and terminals in everyday objects such as a refrigerator or a pair of glasses . The underlying technologies to support ubiquitous computing include Internet , advanced middleware , operating system , mobile code , sensors , microprocessors , new I/O and user interfaces , computer networks , mobile protocols , location and positioning , and new materials . This paradigm is also described as pervasive computing , ambient intelligence , or everyware . Each term emphasizes slightly different aspects . When primarily concerning the objects involved , it is also known as physical computing , the Internet of Things , haptic computing , and things that think . Rather than propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related terms , a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed , from which different kinds or flavors of ubiquitous systems and applications can be described . Ubiquitous computing touches on distributed computing , mobile computing , location computing , mobile networking , sensor networks , human-computer interaction , context-aware smart home technologies , and artificial intelligence .",

In contrast to many other database management systems , SQLite is not a client-server database engine . Rather , it is embedded into the end program . SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard , generally following PostgreSQL syntax . However , SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity . This means that one can , for example , insert a string into a column defined as an integer . SQLite will attempt to convert data between formats where appropriate , the string 123 into an integer in this case , but does not guarantee such conversions , and will store the data as-is if such a conversion is not possible . SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers . It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine , as it is used today by several widespread browsers , operating systems , and embedded systems ( such as mobile phones ) , among others . SQLite has bindings to many programming languages .",

  "/wiki/OS/2": "OS/2 is a series of computer operating systems , initially created by Microsoft and IBM under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci . As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft 's new Windows 3.1 operating environment , the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively . The name stands for Operating System/2 , because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM 's Personal System/2 ( PS/2 ) line of second-generation personal computers . The first version of OS/2 was released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001 . OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS . Notably , basic system calls were modeled after MS-DOS calls ; their names even started with Dos and it was possible to create Family Mode applications - text mode applications that could work on both systems . Because of this heritage , OS/2 shares similarities with Unix , Xenix , and Windows NT . IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on 31 December 2006 . Since then , it has been updated , maintained and marketed under the name eComStation . In 2015 it was announced that a new OEM distribution of OS/2 would be released that was to be called ArcaOS .
