Thousands of years before Europeans arrived , Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples , some of whom remain in the state today . French explorers , missionaries , and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century , encountering the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe tribes .

  "/wiki/Human_Resources_Management_Association_of_Chicago": "HRMAC began in 1915 with a group of seven people who met informally to discuss common problems , but within a few months , it had grown considerably and became known as the Employers ' Advisory Group . This group became formally organized and instituted corporate memberships . The Employers ' Advisory Group had several more names and for a very short period , was a chapter of a national group . The chapter hosted the national organization meeting in Chicago in 1921 for 2,000 people . In fact , on the first day of the event , the wait staff at the conference hotel went on strike . Bag or box lunches were obtained and lunch was eaten at the delegates ' seats in an auditorium . The organization then became known as the Industrial Relations Association of Chicago and kept that name until 1982 when it became known as the Human Resources Management Association of Chicago . HRMAC is Chicagoland 's premier resource for advancing workplace strategy and leadership . HRMAC membership consists of 500 Chicago area organizations with a network of over 5,000 HR Professionals representing small private companies to multi-national public corporations from every business sector .

  "/wiki/Illinois": "Illinois ( /\u02cc\u026al\u0259\u02c8n\u0254\u026a/ ( listen ) IL-\u0259-NOY ) is a state in the Midwestern and Great Lakes Regions of the United States . It has the fifth largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sixth largest population , and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states . Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north ."
