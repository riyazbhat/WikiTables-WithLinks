The aim was to encourage self-sufficiency , and reduce dependence on both market forces and welfare provision . The experiment failed through a clash of ideologies . There was a strong emphasis on accommodating those most in need . Yet there also had to be qualifications to ensure that the community would be self-governed in a professional manner . The entrepreneurial community spirit never took hold , and the project is remembered as a classic failure .
