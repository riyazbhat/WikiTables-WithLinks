  "/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia": "The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) , also known as SFR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia , was a country located in Central and Southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars . Covering an area of 255,804 km\u00b2 ( 98,766 sq mi ) , the SFRY was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west , Austria and Hungary to the north , Bulgaria and Romania to the east , and Albania and Greece to the south . The nation was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and made up of six socialist republics - Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia - with Belgrade as its capital . In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation . The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s ; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics .",
