On four of those tours , matches between the Argentine national side and the visiting team were accorded first-class status , making for thirteen first-class matches in total between 1912 and 1938 .

The South American Championship was created in 1995 by those three teams and Peru , and is now held annually . Argentina has been the dominant team at the championship , winning seven out of the eleven tournaments held , and consequently has sent only development sides since 2000 .
