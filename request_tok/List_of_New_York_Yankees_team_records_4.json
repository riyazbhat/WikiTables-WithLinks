  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",

  "/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox": "The Chicago White Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago , Illinois . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) Central division . The White Sox are owned by Jerry Reinsdorf , and play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field , located on the city 's South Side . They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago ; the other is the Chicago Cubs of the National League ( NL ) Central division . One of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the franchise was established as a major league baseball club in 1901 . The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings , but this was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox . The team originally played home games at South Side Park before moving to Comiskey Park in 1910 , where they played until Guaranteed Rate Field ( originally known as Comiskey Park and then known as U.S. Cellular Field ) opened in 1991 . The White Sox won the 1906 World Series with a defense-oriented team dubbed the Hitless Wonders , and the 1917 World Series led by Eddie Cicotte , Eddie Collins , and Shoeless Joe Jackson . The 1919 World Series was marred by the Black Sox Scandal , in which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to fix games . In response , Major League Baseball 's new Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned the players from Major League Baseball for life . In 1959 , led by Early Wynn , Nellie Fox , Luis Aparicio and manager Al L\u00f3pez , the White Sox won the American League pennant . They won the AL pennant in 2005 , and went on to win the World Series , led by World Series MVP Jermaine Dye , Paul Konerko , Mark Buehrle , catcher A. J. Pierzynski , and the first Latino manager to win the World Series , Ozzie Guill\u00e9n .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Hit_(baseball)": "In baseball statistics , a hit ( denoted by H ) , also called a base hit , is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory , without the benefit of an error or a fielder 's choice .",
  "/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston , Massachusetts . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The team have won nine World Series championships , tied for the third-most of any MLB team , and they have played in 13 . Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018 . In addition , they won the 1904 American League pennant , but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series . Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice .

  "/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays": "The Toronto Blue Jays are a Canadian professional baseball team based in Toronto , Ontario . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The team plays its home games at Rogers Centre . The name Blue Jays originates from the bird of the same name , and blue is also the traditional colour of two of Toronto 's other professional sports teams : the Maple Leafs ( ice hockey ) and the Argonauts ( Canadian football ) . In addition , the team was originally owned by the Labatt Brewing Company , makers of the popular beer Labatt 's Blue . Colloquially nicknamed the Jays , the team 's official colours are royal blue , navy blue , red , and white . An expansion franchise , the club was founded in Toronto in 1977 . Originally based at Exhibition Stadium , the team began playing its home games at SkyDome upon its opening in 1989 . Since 2000 , the Blue Jays have been owned by Rogers Communications and in 2004 , SkyDome was purchased by that company , which renamed it Rogers Centre . They are the second MLB franchise to be based outside the United States , and currently the only team based outside the U.S. after the first Canadian franchise , the Montreal Expos , became the Washington Nationals in 2005 . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , the Blue Jays went through struggles typical of an expansion team , frequently finishing in last place in its division .

  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",

The name Nationals appeared on the uniforms for only two seasons , and was then replaced with the W logo for the next 52 years . However , the names Senators , Nationals and shorter Nats were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next 60 years ; in 2005 , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal . For a time , from 1911 to 1933 , the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball . The team 's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin , Sam Rice , Joe Cronin , Bucky Harris , Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time , Walter Johnson . But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility , including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s . Joe Judge , Cecil Travis , Buddy Myer , Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team 's lack of success .",
  "/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)": "In baseball , a grand slam is a home run hit with all three bases occupied by baserunners ( bases loaded ) , thereby scoring four runs - the most possible in one play . According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary , the term originated in the card game of contract bridge , [ better source needed ] in which a grand slam involves taking all the possible tricks . The word slam , by itself , usually is connected with a loud sound , particularly of a door being closed with excess force ; thus , slamming the door on one 's opponent ( s ) , in addition to the bat slamming the ball into a home run .",

  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",
