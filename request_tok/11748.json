Tamagusuku was born in what is today the Gibo neighborhood of Shuri . A member of the aristocrat-bureaucrat class of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom , Tamagusuku had already journeyed to Edo and Kagoshima five times before being named udui bugy\u014d ( J : odori bugy\u014d ; Magistrate of Dance ) in 1715 . The title was first held by Tansui Ueekata ( \u6e5b\u6c34\u89aa\u65b9 , 1622-1683 ) , and was a post chiefly responsible for organizing the formal entertainments of the Chinese investiture envoys to Ryukyu . Having studied and viewed various Japanese dance and drama forms during his trips to Edo and Kagoshima , including Noh , kabuki and ky\u014dgen , after regaining the title of udui bugy\u00f4 in 1718 , Tamagusuku formulated the dance-drama form known as kumi udui in Okinawan , and as kumi odori in Japanese . It was then performed for the first time , before the Chinese investiture envoys , on a chrysanthemum-viewing day , the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar , the following year . The two plays performed that day are called Nid\u014d Tichiuchi ( The Vendetta of the Two Sons ) and Sh\u016bshin Kani'iri ( Possessed by Love , Thwarted by the Bell ) . Though it 's presumed that he wrote many more , five plays by Tamagusuku survive today , and are still performed .

  "/wiki/Perry_Expedition": "The Perry Expedition was a diplomatic and military expedition to Bakumatsu period Japan , involving two separate trips by warships of the United States Navy , which took place during 1853-54 . The goals of this expedition included exploration , surveying , and the establishment of diplomatic relations and negotiation of trade agreements with various nations of the region ; opening contact with the government of Japan was considered a top priority of the expedition , and was one of the key reasons for its inception . The expedition was commanded by Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry , under orders from American President Millard Fillmore . Perrys primary goal was to force an end to Japans 220-year-old policy of isolation and to open Japanese ports to American trade , through the use of gunboat diplomacy if necessary . The Perry Expedition led directly to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the western Great Powers , and eventually to the collapse of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration . Following the expedition , Japan 's burgeoning trade routes with the world led to the cultural trend of Japonism , in which aspects of Japanese culture influenced art in Europe and America .",
