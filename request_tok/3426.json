  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/EMC_TA": "The EMC-TA was a model of Diesel locomotive produced for the Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railroad by the Electro-Motive Corporation in 1937 . The original six Rock Island Rocket streamliners were three- or four-car stainless-steel semi-articulated trainsets built by Budd Company , powered by six identical locomotives , # 601-606 . The locomotives were classified as model TA - the T indicating Twelve hundred hp ( 890 kW ) , the A indicating an A unit ( cab-equipped lead locomotive ) . The Rock Island Line was EMC 's only customer for the TA locomotive model . The styling of the TAs resembled the A units of the contemporary EA and E1 built in 1937 , but the single 1200 hp Winton 201-A motor provided only two thirds the power of the E-units ' 1800 hp twin motor arrangement , the TAs were shorter and lighter , and they rode two-axle rather than three-axle trucks . Future locomotives for high speed and long distance passenger service would follow the direction taken by the EA/EB , E1 and E2 ; EMC 's FT locomotives introduced in 1939 would adapt the single-engine two-axle truck layout of the TA and the cab/booster format of the E units to freight service . With the introduction of the E-series and the TA units EMC undertook regular production of locomotives of their own design , opening the standardized mass production phase in marketing Diesel power for passenger service . Like the E-series and F-series locomotives , the TA was constructed as a carbody truss rather than having a separate chassis , a weight-saving innovation of early streamliners adapted to full-sized locomotives . The single Winton 201-A V16 engine was placed centrally , centered on the side door and twin flanking windows . The generator was attached behind it , with a cooling fan and air compressor after that . The rear of the unit was taken up with two steam generators for train heating and reservoirs for the air brakes . The cab sat two crew , engineer on the right and fireman on the left .",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/EMC_EA/EB": "The EMC EA/EB was an early passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built in May 16 , 1937 - 1938 by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange , Illinois for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . [ page needed ] They were the first model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units . Each locomotive unit developed 1,800 horsepower ( 1,300 kW ) from two 900 hp ( 670 kW ) Winton 201-A diesel engines , driving the wheels through an electric transmission - the generator driven by each engine provided current for traction motors . The locomotives were of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement - two three-axle trucks of which only the outer two axles were powered . Six two-unit 3,600 hp ( 2,700 kW ) locomotives were produced , each consisting of a lead cab-equipped EA A unit and a cabless booster EB B unit . They were numbered 51 through 56 ; the A units bore the bare number and the B units the number followed by ' X ' .",
  "/wiki/A_unit": "An A unit , in railroad terminology , is a diesel locomotive ( or more rarely an electric locomotive ) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit , and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position . This terminology is generally used in North America , since only there was it commonplace to build B units - cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train .",
  "/wiki/B_unit": "A B unit , in railroad terminology , is a locomotive unit ( generally a diesel locomotive ) which does not have a control cab or crew compartment , and must therefore be operated in tandem with another coupled locomotive with a cab ( an A unit ) . The terms booster unit and cabless are also used . The concept is largely confined to North America . Elsewhere , locomotives without driving cabs are rare .",
  "/wiki/EMC_E1": "The EMC E1 was an early passenger-train diesel locomotive developing 1,800 hp , with an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement , and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange , Illinois . They were built during 1937 and 1938 for the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway for a new generation of diesel-powered streamlined trains . 8 cab-equipped lead A units and three cabless booster B units were built . The initial three locomotives were AB pairs built to haul the Santa Fe 's Super Chief diesel streamliners , while the others were built as single A units to haul shorter trains . The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two 900 hp ( 670 kW ) Winton 201-A engines each , with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors . The E1 was the second model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units . All Winton 201A-engined Santa Fe passenger units , including the E1s , were extensively rebuilt into the 80-class E8M engines in 1952-53 . These were similar to production E8 models , but derated to 2000 hp so as not to burn out the early traction ( axle ) motors ( which were reused ) .",
  "/wiki/EMC_E2": "The EMC E2 was an American passenger-train diesel locomotive which as a single unit developed 1,800 horsepower ( 1,300 kW ) , from two ( 2 ) 900 horsepower ( 670 kW ) prime movers . These locomotives were typically operated as a unit set ( A - B - B ) ; where the three unit lashup developed 5400 horsepower . This was almost the ideal horsepower required ( 6,000 horsepower or 4,500 kilowatts ) for the tonnage of a 15 - 18 car passenger train , operated over the ruling grades of virtually all of the mileage between major American cities . The units were of the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement , and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation ( EMC ) , later Electro-Motive Diesel ( EMD ) of La Grange , Illinois . Two sets ( each of three units , A-B-B ) ( 5,400 horsepower or 4,000 kilowatts ) were produced in 1937 for named passenger trains ; the first set ( SF-1 , SF-2 , and SF-3 ) for the City of San Francisco . These motive-power sets were jointly owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad , the Chicago and North Western Railway , and the Southern Pacific Railroad . The second A-B-B set ( LA-1 , LA-2 , and LA-3 ) was used for the City of Los Angeles ; and , was jointly owned and operated by the UP and CNW only . The first locomotive power unit was the control cab , or A unit , while the other two were cabless boosters , or B units . The control cab and booster units were designed for multiple unit operation ( the first in diesel motive power ) . A single engine crew in the cab , remotely monitored and controlled all three motive power units from a single control station in the cab . The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two 900 hp Winton 201-A engines each , with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors . In addition the locomotives contained steam generators for passenger car heating .",
  "/wiki/EMC_E3": "The EMC E3 is a 2,000 horsepower ( 1,500 kW ) , A1A-A1A passenger train locomotive that was manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange , Illinois . The EMC demonstrator # 822 was released from La Grange for test on September 12 , 1938 . The cab version , or E3A , was manufactured from September 1938 to June 1940 , and 17 were produced . The booster version , or E3B , was manufactured in March 1939 and September 1939 , and 2 were produced . The 2,000 hp ( 1,500 kW ) was achieved by putting two 1,000 horsepower ( 750 kW ) , 12-cylinder , model 567 engines in the engine compartment . Each engine drove its own electrical generator to power the traction motors . The E3 was the fourth model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units . Compared with passenger locomotives made later by EMD , the noses of the E3 , E4 , E5 , and E6 cab units had pronounced slants when viewed from the side . Therefore , these four models have been nicknamed slant nose units . Later E models had the more vertical bulldog nose of the F series . E3 demonstrator 822 was built with a nose identical to earlier EA and E1A units , but later locomotives in the series featured an elevated headlamp mounted in a nacelle , distinct from the flush profile mounting of the earlier units . 822 was modified in a similar fashion prior to delivery to the Kansas City Southern Railway .",

The front noses of the EA , E1A , E3A , E4A , E5A , and E6A cab units had a pronounced slant when viewed from the side . Therefore , these six models have been nicknamed slant nose units . Later E-unit models received the same blunted bulldog nose as the F-units . Ironically , the E4 was produced before the E3 . Both models were identical , save for the E4 having a pneumatically-operated nose door passageway in order to facilitate crew movement between units in a locomotive consist . All the E4s were retired and scrapped by 1964 .",
  "/wiki/EMC_AA": "AA was a designator used for several different diesel locomotive types custom built by General Motors Corporation EMC/GM with passenger or baggage space in the same body . This locomotive is listed as class AA-6 by R. Craig , and the designation is logical as the locomotive is described as half an E6 in the Second Diesel Spotter 's Guide . One such was a single locomotive built for the Missouri Pacific Railroad , delivered in August 1940 , numbered # 7100 . MP 7100 was built for service with the Delta Eagle passenger train , which ran between Memphis , Tennessee and Tallulah , Louisiana . Note : Missouri Pacific ordered all their ' E ' units with portholes instead of square windows like most of the E series from the EA to E7 's . This was the only MoPac unit with square windows ( on the baggage door ) . Since the two-car train the unit would have to haul was comparatively light , the AA was built with only one 1,000 hp EMD 567 V12 prime mover , and a baggage compartment where the second diesel would have been . Other EMC/GM locomotives carrying the AA classification include the Pioneer Zephyr , Flying Yankee , and General Pershing Zephyr power units .",
  "/wiki/EMC_AB6": "The EMC AB6 was a type of diesel locomotive built exclusively for the Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railroad ( the Rock Island Line ) by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Corporation and delivered in June 1940 . Two examples were built , numbered # 750 and # 751 . They were built for the Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger train , which travelled as a unified train from Chicago , Illinois , to Limon , Colorado , which then divided . One section went to Colorado Springs , Colorado , and the other to Denver , Colorado . The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route , and could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs . A regular , cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased , but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train , so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an E-series E6B ( B unit ) but with an operating cab , headlight , pilot , and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive . Since the small three- and four-car trains the units would have to haul independently were very light , the AB6 pair were built with only one 1,000 hp EMC 567 V12 engine , and a baggage compartment where the second engine would have been . Later , with increasing trainloads , the baggage compartment was replaced with a second engine . In 1965 , the units had their steam generators replaced with head-end power and were reassigned to push-pull suburban service in the Chicago area . In this form , they lasted until the mid-1970s .",

The E5 was distinguished from the otherwise very similar E3 , E4 and E6 by being clad in polished stainless steel to match the Burlington 's Zephyr trains . It also featured unique small grill-like ornamentation on both sides of the upper headlight . Like the other models in the \u00c9-series , the E5 had a sloping slant nose and it was equipped with two headlights - a regular stationary headlight above a gyrating Mars signal light .

In profile the front of the nose of E7 , E8 , and E9 units is less slanted than earlier EMD units , and E7/8/9s ( and their four axle cousins , the F-unit series ) have been nicknamed bulldog nose units . Earlier E-unit locomotives were nicknamed slant nose units . After passenger trains were canceled on the Erie Lackawanna in 1970 , the E8s were re-geared for freight and were very reliable for the EL .
