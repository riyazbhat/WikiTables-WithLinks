  "/wiki/Flower_(skunk)": "Bambi is a 1942 American animated film directed by David Hand ( supervising a team of sequence directors ) , produced by Walt Disney and based on the 1923 book Bambi , a Life in the Woods by Austrian author Felix Salten . The film was released by RKO Radio Pictures on August 13 , 1942 , and is the fifth Disney animated feature film . The main characters are Bambi , a mule deer ; his parents ( the Great Prince of the forest and his unnamed mother ) ; his friends Thumper ( a pink-nosed rabbit ) ; and Flower ( a skunk ) ; and his childhood friend and future mate , Faline . For the movie , Disney took the liberty of changing Bambi 's species into a mule deer from his original species of roe deer , since roe deer are not native to North America , and the mule deer is more widespread in the United States . The film received three Academy Award nominations : Best Sound ( Sam Slyfield ) , Best Song ( for Love Is a Song sung by Donald Novis ) and Original Music Score . In June 2008 , the American Film Institute presented a list of its 10 Top 10 - the best ten films in each of ten classic American film genres - after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community . Bambi placed third in animation . In December 2011 , the film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress . In January 2020 , it was announced that a live-action styled adaptation was in development .",

  "/wiki/Fungo_Squiggly": "Get Fuzzy is an American gag-a-day comic strip written and drawn by Darby Conley . The strip features the adventures of Boston advertising executive Rob Wilco and his two anthropomorphic pets , a dog named Satchel Pooch and a cat called Bucky Katt . The strip 's humor comes from the conflict between Bucky 's and Satchel 's personalities , which are extreme stereotypes of cats and dogs . Sweet , trusting , na\u00efve Satchel is routinely subjected to the exploitation of cruel , self-centered Bucky , who is always torturing the poor canine . Rob , the middleman , is often frazzled from dealing with them , or more specifically , from dealing with Bucky 's destructive nature and overall nastiness . The three characters live in an apartment on Boston 's Longwood Avenue . Get Fuzzy often eschews the traditional setup-punchline format of most funnies , instead building on absurd dialog between characters . The unusual title of the strip comes from a concert poster that Darby Conley once created for his brother 's band , the Fuzzy Sprouts . Life 's too short to be cool , the poster read , Get Fuzzy .",

  "/wiki/A_Wizard_of_Earthsea": "A Wizard of Earthsea is a fantasy novel written by American author Ursula K. Le Guin and first published by the small press Parnassus in 1968 . It is regarded as a classic of children 's literature , and of fantasy , within which it was widely influential . The story is set in the fictional archipelago of Earthsea and centers around a young mage named Ged , born in a village on the island of Gont . He displays great power while still a boy and joins the school of wizardry , where his prickly nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows . During a magical duel , Ged 's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him . The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature . The book has often been described as a Bildungsroman , or coming-of-age story , as it explores Ged 's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death . The novel also carries Taoist themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea , which wizards are supposed to maintain , closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance . The structure of the story is similar to that of a traditional epic , although critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways , such as by making the protagonist dark-skinned in contrast to more typical white-skinned heroes . A Wizard of Earthsea received highly positive reviews , initially as a work for children and later among a general audience as well . It won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in 1969 and was one of the final recipients of the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1979 . Margaret Atwood called it one of the wellsprings of fantasy literature .",

However , even the more dramatic and soap operatic story arcs often conform to the common gag comic strip format . While there is often sexual innuendo and cartoon violence , the comic contains little strong profanity and no explicit nudity .",
