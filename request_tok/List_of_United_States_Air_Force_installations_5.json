The Fighting Falcon 's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility , side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering , an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot , and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft . The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment . The F-16 's official name is Fighting Falcon , but Viper is commonly used by its pilots and crews , due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service .

  "/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile": "An intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres ( 3,400 mi ) primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery ( delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads ) . Similarly , conventional , chemical , and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness , but have never been deployed on ICBMs . Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ( MIRVs ) , allowing a single missile to carry several warheads , each of which can strike a different target . Russia , the United States , China , India , Iran and North Korea are the only countries that have operational ICBMs . Early ICBMs had limited precision , which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets , such as cities . They were seen as a safe basing option , one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack . Attacks against military targets ( especially hardened ones ) still demanded the use of a more precise , manned bomber . Second- and third-generation designs ( such as the LGM-118 Peacekeeper ) dramatically improved accuracy to the point where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked . ICBMs are differentiated by having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles : intermediate-range ballistic missiles ( IRBMs ) , medium-range ballistic missiles ( MRBMs ) , short-range ballistic missiles ( SRBMs ) and tactical ballistic missiles ( TBMs ) . Short and medium-range ballistic missiles are known collectively as theatre ballistic missiles .",
