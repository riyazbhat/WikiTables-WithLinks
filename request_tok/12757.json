  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",
  "/wiki/Mallet's_Mortar": "Mallet 's Mortar was a British shell-firing mortar built for the Crimean War , but never used in combat . The mortar was designed by Robert Mallet and was constructed in separate sections so that it could be transported . Robert Mallet first made his design public in 1854 . There was little response from the authorities until Mallet wrote to the then Prime Minister Lord Palmerston in March 1855 . Palmerston was taken with the idea and instructed the Board of Ordnance to arrange for the construction of two mortars of Mallet 's design . Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company won the contract at a price of \u00a34,300 per mortar . The company 's bankruptcy resulted in the work being divided among three firms which managed to deliver the mortars in May 1857 . Testing began on 19 October 1857 with further testing on 18 December 1857 , 21 July 1858 and 28 of July 1858 . Each test was brought to an end by damage to the mortar . A total of 19 rounds were fired with a rate of about 4 shells an hour being achieved . Shell weight was between 2,352 and 2,940 pounds ( 1,067 and 1,334 kg ) . In testing with an 80-pound ( 36 kg ) charge it fired the lighter shell a distance of 2,759 yards ( 2,523 m ) with a flight time of 23 seconds .",

Mortars are typically used as indirect fire weapons for close fire support with a variety of ammunition .",
  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) .

Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law .

  "/wiki/Krupp": "The Krupp family ( see pronunciation ) , a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen , is famous for their production of steel , artillery , ammunition and other armaments . The family business , known as Friedrich Krupp AG ( Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp after acquiring Hoesch AG in 1991 and lasting until 1999 ) , was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century , and was the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany in both world wars . Starting from the Thirty Years ' War until the end of the Second World War , it produced battleships , U-boats , tanks , howitzers , guns , utilities , and hundreds of other commodities . The dynasty began in 1587 when a trader named Arndt Krupp moved to Essen and joined the merchants ' guild . He began buying vacated real estate from families who fled the city due to the Black Death [ dubious - discuss ] , and became one of the city 's richest men . His descendants produced small guns during the Thirty Years ' War and eventually acquired fulling mills , coal mines , and an iron forge . During the Napoleonic Wars , Friedrich Krupp founded the Gusstahlfabrik ( Cast Steel Works ) and started smelted steel production in 1816 . This led to the company becoming a major industrial power and laid the foundation for the steel empire that would come to dominate the world for nearly a century under his son Alfred . Krupp became the arms manufacturer for the Kingdom of Prussia in 1859 , and later the German Empire . During the 19th century , Alfred Krupp pioneered various benefit and social programs for the workers of the Krupp company . These included on-site technical and manual training , insurance ( accident and life ) , low cost housing , hospitals , recreational facilities , parks , schools , bath houses , saloons , and department stores .

  "/wiki/French_Third_Republic": "The French Third Republic ( French : La Troisi\u00e8me R\u00e9publique , sometimes written as La IIIe R\u00e9publique ) was the system of government adopted in France from 1870 , when the Second French Empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War , until 10 July 1940 after France 's defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II led to the formation of the Vichy government in France . The early days of the Third Republic were dominated by political disruptions caused by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 , which the Republic continued to wage after the fall of Emperor Napoleon III in 1870 . Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of Alsace ( keeping the Territoire de Belfort ) and Lorraine ( the northeastern part , i.e . present-day department of Moselle ) , social upheaval , and the establishment of the Paris Commune . The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy , but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved . Consequently , the Third Republic , originally envisioned as a provisional government , instead became the permanent form of government of France . The French Constitutional Laws of 1875 defined the composition of the Third Republic . It consisted of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate to form the legislative branch of government and a president to serve as head of state . Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents , Adolphe Thiers and Patrice de MacMahon , but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration . The Third Republic established many French colonial possessions , including French Indochina , French Madagascar , French Polynesia , and large territories in West Africa during the Scramble for Africa , all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century . The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the Democratic Republican Alliance , which was originally conceived as a centre-left political alliance , but over time became the main centre-right party .

The M-Ger\u00e4t had a 42-centimetre ( 17 in ) calibre barrel , making it one of the largest artillery pieces ever fielded . It was first designed in 1911 and entered production the next year . Test firing began in early 1914 , and the gun was estimated to be finished by October . When World War I broke out , the two available M-Ger\u00e4t guns , still prototypes , were sent to Li\u00e8ge and destroyed Forts Pontisse and Loncin . German soldiers bestowed the gun with the nickname Big Bertha , which then spread through German newspapers to the Allies , who used it as a nickname for all superheavy German artillery . The Paris Gun , used in 1918 after all Big Berthas had been removed from service , has historically been confused for the M-Ger\u00e4t . Due to losses from faulty ammunition and Allied counter-battery artillery , a smaller-calibre ( 30.5-centimetre ( 12.0 in ) ) gun called the Beta-M-Ger\u00e4t was built and fielded from 1916 until the end of the war . It had a longer and heavier barrel that was mated to the M-Ger\u00e4t 's carriage , but was found to be less effective than the base gun .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",

In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

It was designed to penetrate the weakly armored decks of modern dreadnoughts in accord with the prevailing coastal defense doctrine that held it was better to attack the weakest point with high-angle indirect fire than to attempt to challenge their strongly armored sides with exceedingly expensive guns that had to be equally as well armored to withstand return fire from the battleship . Howitzers were significantly cheaper and could be hidden behind hills to avoid the expense of armoring them . The known problem of hitting a moving target with indirect fire was to be alleviated by massed fire from multiple weapons all firing with the same data . At any rate , two howitzers were bought to defend the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola on the Adriatic . They were to be installed on a turntable carriage with an armored dome able to traverse a full 360\u00b0 for all-around defense . The turntable rested on a ball-race ring , set in a concrete foundation . However , with Pola unthreatened after the outbreak of the war , it was decided that they might be better used in support of the Army . The first howitzer was already fixed in place , but the second was n't yet installed and Skoda was able to adapt it for mobile use by January 1915 .

It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power .

  "/wiki/Gun": "A gun is a ranged weapon typically designed to pneumatically discharge solid projectiles but can also be liquid ( as in water guns/cannons and projected water disruptors ) or even charged particles ( as in a plasma gun ) and may be free-flying ( as with bullets and artillery shells ) or tethered ( as with Taser guns , spearguns and harpoon guns ) . The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs , but are traditionally effected by a high gas pressure contained within a shooting tube ( gun barrel ) , produced either through the rapid combustion of propellants ( as with firearms ) , or by mechanical compression ( as with air guns ) . The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile , accelerating it down the length of the tube , imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it at the end of the tube . Alternatively , acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed , in which case the shooting tube may be substituted by guide rails ( as in railguns ) or wrapped with magnetic coils ( as in coilguns ) . The first devices identified as guns appeared in China from around CE 1000 . By the 12th century , the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia , and into Europe by the 13th century .",

As part of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , both of these ship classes were cancelled part way through construction , surplussing about 70 examples of the 16-inch/50 which had already been built . Twenty were released to the US Army , between 1922-1924 , for use by the Coast Artillery Corps , the rest were kept in storage for future naval use . Only ten of the twenty available guns were deployed ( in five two-gun batteries ) prior to 1940 . When the design of the Iowa-class battleship began in 1938 , it was initially assumed these ships would use the surplus guns .
