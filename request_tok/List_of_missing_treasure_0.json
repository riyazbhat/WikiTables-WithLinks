It replaced Solomon 's Temple ( the First Temple ) , which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE , when Jerusalem was conquered and part of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile to Babylon . The Second Temple was originally a rather modest structure constructed by a number of Jewish exile groups returning to the Levant from Babylon under the Achaemenid-appointed governor Zerubbabel . However , during the reign of Herod the Great , the Second Temple was completely refurbished , and the original structure was totally overhauled into the large and magnificent edifices and facades that are more recognizable . Much as the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple , the Romans destroyed the Second Temple and Jerusalem in 70 CE as retaliation for an ongoing Jewish revolt .

The siege of the city began on 14 April 70 CE , three days before the beginning of Passover that year . The siege lasted for about four months ; it ended in August 70 CE on Tisha B'Av with the burning and destruction of the Second Temple . The Romans then entered and sacked the Lower City . The Arch of Titus , celebrating the Roman sack of Jerusalem and the Temple , still stands in Rome . The conquest of the city was complete on approximately 8 September 70 CE .

Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",
  "/wiki/Vandals": "The Vandals were an early Germanic people who first appeared in history inhabiting present-day southern Poland . Some later moved in large numbers , including most notably the group which successively established Vandal kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula , on western Mediterranean islands and in North Africa in the 5th century . The traditional view has been that the Vandals migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle from Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many Germanic tribes to migrate into the territory of the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next the Vandals were pushed westwards , crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest Iberia ) and Baetica ( south-central Iberia ) respectively . On the orders of the Romans the Visigoths invaded Iberia in 418 . They almost wiped out the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals who voluntarily subjected themselves to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric ( reigned 428-477 ) , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 .",

These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity , or what is known as the Migration Period . The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups ( possibly the Thervingi ) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 . Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable , alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient . The Visigoths under Alaric I invaded Italy and sacked Rome in 410 . After the Visigoths sacked Rome , they began settling down , first in southern Gaul and eventually in Hispania , where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD . The Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as foederati to the Romans - a relationship established in 418 . However , they soon fell out with their Roman hosts ( for reasons that are now obscure ) and established their own kingdom with its capital at Toulouse . They next extended their authority into Hispania at the expense of the Suebi and Vandals . In 507 , however , their rule in Gaul was ended by the Franks under Clovis I , who defeated them in the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 . After that , the Visigoth kingdom was limited to Hispania , and they never again held territory north of the Pyrenees other than Septimania .

Alaric began his career under the Gothic soldier Gainas , and later joined the Roman army . He first appeared as leader of a mixed band of Goths and allied peoples , who invaded Thrace in 391 but were stopped by the half-Vandal Roman General Stilicho . In 394 , he led a Gothic force of 20,000 that helped Roman Emperor Theodosius defeat the Frankish usurper Arbogast at the Battle of Frigidus . Despite sacrificing around 10,000 of his men , Alaric received little recognition from the emperor . Disappointed , he left the army , was elected reiks of the Visigoths in 395 and marched toward Constantinople until he was diverted by Roman forces . He then moved southward into Greece , where he sacked Piraeus ( the port of Athens ) and destroyed Corinth , Megara , Argos and Sparta . Nonetheless , the Eastern emperor Arcadius appointed Alaric magister militum ( master of the soldiers ) in Illyricum . In 401 Alaric invaded Italy , but was defeated by Stilicho at Pollentia ( modern Pollenza ) on April 6 , 402 .

The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire and was recognised as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighbouring arch-rival , the Roman-Byzantine Empire for a period of more than 400 years . The Sasanian Empire was founded by Ardashir I , after the fall of the Parthian Empire and the defeat of the last Arsacid king , Artabanus V.

He was the son of Hormizd IV ( reigned 579-590 ) and the grandson of Khosrow I ( reigned 531-579 ) . Khosrow II was the last king of Iran to have a lengthy reign before the Muslim conquest of Iran , which began five years after his execution . He lost his throne , then recovered it with Roman help , and , a decade later , went on to emulate the feats of the Achaemenids , conquering the rich Roman provinces of the Middle East ; much of his reign was spent in wars with the Byzantine Empire and struggling against usurpers such as Bahram Chobin and Vistahm . During the climactic Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628 , Khosrow expanded deep into western Asia Minor , eventually besieging the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 626 alongside Avar and Slavic allies . Following the failure of the siege , Heraclius started a counterattack , undoing all territorial gains by Khosrow in the Levant , most of Anatolia , the western Caucasus , and Egypt , eventually marching into the Sassanian capital of Ctesiphon .

On April 25 , 1185 , the fleet of the Minamoto clan ( Genji ) , led by Minamoto no Yoshitsune , defeated the fleet of the Taira clan ( Heike ) . The morning rip tide was an advantage to the Taira in the morning but turned to their disadvantage in the afternoon . The young Emperor Antoku was one of those who perished amongst the Taira nobles . The Taira were outnumbered , but some sources say that they had the advantage over the Minamoto in understanding the tides of that particular area , as well as naval combat tactics in general . The Taira split their fleet into three squadrons , while their enemy arrived en masse , their ships abreast , and archers ready . The beginning of the battle consisted mainly of a long-range archery exchange , before the Taira took the initiative , using the tides to help them try to surround the enemy ships . They engaged the Minamoto , and the archery from a distance eventually gave way to hand-to-hand combat with swords and daggers after the crews of the ships boarded each other . However , the tide changed , and the advantage was given back to the Minamoto . One of the crucial factors that allowed the Minamoto to win the battle was that a Taira general , Taguchi Shigeyoshi , defected and attacked the Taira from the rear . He also revealed to the Minamoto which ship the six-year-old Emperor Antoku was on . Their archers turned their attention to the helmsmen and rowers of the Emperor 's ship , as well as the rest of their enemy 's fleet , sending their ships out of control .",

It resulted in the downfall of the Taira and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate under Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1192 . The name Genpei ( sometimes romanized as Gempei ) comes from alternate readings of the kanji Minamoto ( \u6e90 Gen ) and Taira ( \u5e73 Hei ) .

It followed a coup d'\u00e9tat by the Taira in 1179 with the removal of rivals from all government posts , and subsequently banishing them , and a call to arms against the Taira , led by the Minamoto in 1180 . The ensuing battle of Uji took place just outside Kyoto , starting a five-year-long war , concluding with a decisive Minamoto victory in the naval battle of Dan-no-ura .",

  "/wiki/John,_King_of_England": "John ( 24 December 1166 - 19 October 1216 ) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216 . He was the third king of the House of Plantagenet . He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France , resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century . The baronial revolt at the end of John 's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta , a document sometimes considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom . John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine . He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands . He became Henry 's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173-74 by his brothers Henry the Young King , Richard , and Geoffrey against the King . John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . The war between Henry II and his eldest sons ended with the deaths of Henry the Young King and Geoffrey . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother , King Richard , whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade , but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199 . He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 . When war with France broke out again in 1202 , John achieved early victories , but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman , Breton , and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204 .",

The war resulted from King John 's refusal to accept and abide by Magna Carta , which he had sealed on 15 June 1215 . After John 's death the ambitions of the French crown prince Louis to be King of England meant that many of the rebels switched sides and the war dragged on .

Little is known of the first 40 years of his life , as only four of his personal letters survive along with a summary of a speech that he delivered in 1628 . He became an Independent Puritan after undergoing a religious conversion in the 1630s , taking a generally tolerant view towards the many Protestant sects of his period . He was an intensely religious man , a self-styled Puritan Moses , and he fervently believed that God was guiding his victories . He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the Short ( 1640 ) and Long ( 1640-1649 ) Parliaments .

The word bullion comes from the French word bouillon , which meant boiling , and was the term for the activity of a melting house which creates the ingots or bars from the raw material . The value of bullion is typically determined by the value of its precious metals content , which is defined by its purity and mass . To assess the purity of gold bullion , the centuries-old technique of fire assay is still employed , together with modern spectroscopic instrumentation , to accurately determine its quality to ensure that the true worth of the bullion is paid out ; maintaining its security as an investment .

  "/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire": "The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , also known as the Spanish-Mexican War ( 1519-21 ) , was one of the primary events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas . There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquerors , their indigenous allies , and the defeated Aztecs . It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs , and most especially the Aztecs ' indigenous enemies and rivals . They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period . For the Spanish , the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean . Following an earlier expedition led by Juan de Grijalva to Yucat\u00e1n in 1518 , Spanish settler , Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s , led an expedition ( entrada ) to Mexico . Two years later , in 1519 , Cort\u00e9s and his retinue set sail for Mexico . The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521 , when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cort\u00e9s and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtemoc and Tenochtitlan , the capital of the Aztec Empire . The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico , and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan . Cort\u00e9s made alliances with tributary city-states ( altepetl ) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals , particularly the Tlaxcalteca and Texcocans , a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance . Other city-states also joined , including Cempoala and Huexotzinco and polities bordering Lake Texcoco , the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico .

While the origins of the position are mythical and originate from the legendary foundation of the city of Cusco , it seems to have come into being historically around 1100 CE . Although the Inca believed the Sapa to be the son of Inti ( the Inca Sun god ) and often referred to him as Intip Churin or Son of the Sun , the position eventually became hereditary , with son succeeding father . The principal wife of the Inca was known as the Coya or Qoya . The Sapa Inca was at the top of the social hierarchy , and played a dominant role in the political and spiritual realm .

After defeating his brother , Atahualpa became very briefly the last Sapa Inca ( sovereign emperor ) of the Inca Empire ( Tawantinsuyu ) before the Spanish conquest ended his reign . Before the Inca Emperor Huayna Capac died in Quito in 1524 ( possibly due to smallpox , a disease brought by Europeans ) , he had appointed his son Ninan Cuyochi as his successor . Ninan died of the same disease . The Cusquenian nobles named Hu\u00e1scar ( another son of Huayna ) as Sapa Inca , and he appointed his brother Atahualpa as governor of Quito . The Inca Civil War began in 1529 when Hu\u00e1scar declared war on Atahualpa , for fear that he would try to carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat against him . Atahualpa became Inca emperor in May 1532 after he had defeated and imprisoned Hu\u00e1scar and massacred any pretenders to the throne . The Spaniard Francisco Pizarro captured Atahualpa in November 1532 and used him to control the Inca Empire . While imprisoned by the Spaniards , Atahualpa gave orders to kill Hu\u00e1scar in Jauja , thinking Hu\u00e1scar would use the Spaniards as allies to regain his throne . The Spanish eventually executed Atahualpa , effectively ending the empire .

  "/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era": "The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continent , spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period . While the phrase pre-Columbian era literally refers only to the time preceding Christopher Columbus 's voyages of 1492 , in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of indigenous American cultures until those cultures were extinguished , diminished , or extensively altered by Europeans , even if this happened long after Columbus . The alternative terms precontact , precolonial , or prehistoric Americas are also used ; in Latin America , the usual term is pre-Hispanic . Many pre-Columbian civilizations were marked by permanent settlements , cities , agriculture , civic and monumental architecture , major earthworks , and complex societal hierarchies . Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans ( c. late 16th-early 17th centuries ) , and are known only through archaeological investigations and oral history . Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time . A few , such as the Maya civilization , had their own written records . Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan , men like Diego de Landa burned them , even while seeking to preserve native histories . Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages , while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish , giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge . Many indigenous American peoples continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting to the modern world .",
  "/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Peru": "The Viceroyalty of Peru ( Spanish : Virreinato del Per\u00fa ) was a Spanish imperial provincial administrative district , created in 1542 , that originally contained modern-day Peru and most of Spanish-ruled South America , governed from the capital of Lima . Peru was one of the two Spanish Viceroyalties in the Americas from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries . The Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian established by the Treaty of Tordesillas . The treaty was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while Spain controlled Portugal . The creation during the 18th century of Viceroyalties of New Granada and R\u00edo de la Plata ( at the expense of Peru 's territory ) reduced the importance of Lima and shifted the lucrative Andean trade to Buenos Aires , while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru . Eventually , the viceroyalty would dissolve , as with much of the Spanish Empire , when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century . These movements led to the formation of the modern-day country of Peru , as well as Chile , Colombia , Panama , Ecuador , Bolivia , Paraguay , Uruguay , Argentina , and Guyana , the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of Peru .",

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

  "/wiki/Texas_Revolution": "The Texas Revolution ( October 2 , 1835 - April 21 , 1836 ) was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and Tejanos ( Texas Mexicans ) in putting up armed resistance to the centralist government of Mexico . While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna , the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation . The Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree , declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such , being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag . Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico , establishing the Republic of Texas , and eventually being annexed by the United States . The revolution began in October 1835 , after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas . The Mexican government had become increasingly centralized and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed , particularly regarding immigration from the United States . Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824 . While delegates at the Consultation ( provisional government ) debated the war 's motives , Texians and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835 . The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government , whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas . An ill-conceived proposal to invade Matamoros siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling Texian Army . In March 1836 , a second political convention declared independence and appointed leadership for the new Republic of Texas . Determined to avenge Mexico 's honor , Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas .",
  "/wiki/Holy_Grail": "The Holy Grail is a treasure that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature . Different traditions describe it as a cup , dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness , eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance , often in the custody of the Fisher King . The term holy grail is often used to denote an elusive object or goal that is sought after for its great significance . A grail , wondrous but not explicitly holy , first appears in Perceval , le Conte du Graal , an unfinished romance written by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes around 1190 . Chr\u00e9tien 's story attracted many continuators , translators and interpreters in the later 12th and early 13th centuries , including Wolfram von Eschenbach , who perceived the Grail as a stone . In the late 12th century , Robert de Boron wrote in Joseph d'Arimathie that the Grail was Jesus 's vessel from the Last Supper , which Joseph of Arimathea used to catch Christ 's blood at the crucifixion . Thereafter , the Holy Grail became interwoven with the legend of the Holy Chalice , the Last Supper cup , a theme continued in works such as the Vulgate Cycle , the Post-Vulgate Cycle , as well as Le Morte d'Arthur .",

The broad , low dominantly andesitic stratovolcano rises above the northern end of the Kanto Plain . It contains an elliptical , 3 x 4 km summit caldera with post-caldera lava domes arranged along a NW-SE line . Lake Ono is located at the NE end of the caldera . An older stratovolcano was partially destroyed by edifice collapse , producing a debris-avalanche deposit along the south flank . A series of large plinian eruptions accompanied growth of a second stratovolcano during the Pleistocene . Construction of the central cone in the late-Pleistocene summit caldera began following the last of the plinian eruptions about 31,000 years ago . During historical time unusual activity was recorded on several occasions during the 9th century , but reported eruptions in 1251 and 1938 are considered uncertain .

The Tokugawa Shogunate was established by Tokugawa Ieyasu after victory at the Battle of Sekigahara , ending the civil wars of the Sengoku period following the collapse of the Ashikaga Shogunate . Ieyasu became the Sh\u014dgun and the Tokugawa clan governed Japan from Edo Castle in the eastern city of Edo ( Tokyo ) along with the daimy\u014d lords of the samurai class . The Tokugawa Shogunate organized Japanese society under the strict Tokugawa class system and banned most foreigners under the isolationist policies of Sakoku to promote political stability . The Tokugawa and daimy\u014d de facto administered Japan through their system of han ( feudal domains ) alongside the de jure Imperial provinces .

He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa , and President of the South African Republic ( or Transvaal ) from 1883 to 1900 . Nicknamed Oom Paul ( Uncle Paul ) , he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause - that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State - against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899-1902 . He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom , and remains a controversial and divisive figure ; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero , and critics view him as the obstinate guardian of an alledgedly unjust cause . Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony , Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s . He had almost no education apart from the Bible , and through his interpretation believed the Earth was flat . A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius , he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic , leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions . In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General , a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Burgers . Kruger was appointed Vice-President in March 1877 , shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal . Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned . He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic 's independence , culminating in the Boers ' victory in the First Boer War of 1880-81 . Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate , then was elected President .",
  "/wiki/Irish_Crown_Jewels": "The Jewels Belonging to the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick , commonly called the Irish Crown Jewels or State Jewels of Ireland , were the heavily jewelled star and badge regalia created in 1831 for the Sovereign and Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick , an order of knighthood established in 1783 by George III as King of Ireland to be an Irish equivalent of the English Order of the Garter and the Scottish Order of the Thistle . The British monarch was the Sovereign of the order , as monarch of Ireland until 1801 and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland thereafter . The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the Grand Master in the absence of the Sovereign . The insignia were worn by the Sovereign at the investiture of new Knights as members of the order , and by the Grand Master on other formal ceremonial occasions .

  "/wiki/Order_of_St._Patrick": "The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick is a dormant British order of chivalry associated with Ireland . The Order was created in 1783 by George III at the request of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , The 3rd Earl Temple ( created The 1st Marquess of Buckingham in 1784 ) . The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1922 , when most of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State , a dominion within what was then known as the British Commonwealth of Nations . While the Order technically still exists , no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936 , and the last surviving knight , Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , died in 1974 . The Queen , however , remains the Sovereign of the Order , and one officer , the Ulster King of Arms ( now combined with Norroy King of Arms ) , also survives . St Patrick is patron of the order ; its motto is Quis separabit ? , Latin for Who will separate [ us ] ? : an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8:35 , Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire kingdom , but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent country only . The Order of St Patrick , which pertains to Ireland , is the most junior of these three in precedence and age . Its equivalent in England , The Most Noble Order of the Garter , is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom , dating to the middle fourteenth century . The Scottish equivalent is The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle , dating in its modern form to 1687 .",

It is located off Dame Street in Dublin . Until 1922 it was the seat of the British government 's administration in Ireland . Most of the current construction dates from the 18th century , though a castle has stood on the site since the days of King John , the first Lord of Ireland . The Castle served as the seat of English , then later British , government of Ireland under the Lordship of Ireland ( 1171-1541 ) , the Kingdom of Ireland ( 1541-1800 ) , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( 1800-1922 ) . After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 , the complex was ceremonially handed over to the newly formed Provisional Government led by Michael Collins . It now hosts the inauguration of each President of Ireland and various State receptions . The castle was built by the dark pool ( Dubh Linn ) which gave Dublin its name . This pool lies on the lower course of the River Poddle before its confluence with the River Liffey ; when the castle was built , the Liffey was much wider , and the castle was effectively defended by both rivers . The Poddle today runs under the complex ."
