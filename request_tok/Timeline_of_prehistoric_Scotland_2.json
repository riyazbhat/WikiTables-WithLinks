  "/wiki/Sutherland": "Sutherland is a historic county , registration county and lieutenancy area in the Highlands of Scotland . Its county town is Dornoch . Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east , Ross-shire and Cromartyshire ( later combined into Ross and Cromarty ) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west . Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire , Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in the whole of Europe , especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea . These include high sea cliffs , and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks . The name Sutherland dates from the era of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands , under the rule of the jarl of Orkney . Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain , it was called Su\u00f0rland ( southern land ) from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness . In Gaelic , the area is referred to according to its traditional areas : D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh ( or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh ) in the northeast , Asainte ( Assynt ) in the west , and Cataibh in the east . Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole . The northwest corner of Sutherland , traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver , was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601 . This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay , and as such was named in Gaelic , D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh , the Homeland of Mackay . Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country , and , unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted , there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich .",

  "/wiki/Jet_(lignite)": "Jet is a type of lignite , a precursor to coal , and is a gemstone . Unlike many gemstones , jet is not a mineral , but is rather a mineraloid . It is derived from wood that has changed under extreme pressure . The English noun jet derives from the French word for the same material , jaiet ( modern French jais ) , ultimately referring to the ancient town of Gagae . Jet is either black or dark brown , but may contain pyrite inclusions , which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre . The adjective jet-black , meaning as dark a black as possible , derives from this material .",
  "/wiki/West_Lothian": "West Lothian ( Scots : Wast Lowden ; Scottish Gaelic : Lodainn an Iar ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , and one of its historic counties . The county , which was also known as Linlithgowshire , was bounded geographically by the Avon to the west and the Almond to the east . The modern council area occupies a larger area , with areas in the west transferred to Falkirk and areas in the east transferred to Edinburgh following local government reforms in the late 20th century . It did however gain areas from Midlothian . West Lothian lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and is predominantly rural , though there were extensive coal , iron , and shale oil mining operations in the 19th and 20th centuries , which created distinctive red spoil heaps ( locally known as bings ) throughout the council area . The old county town was the royal burgh of Linlithgow , but the largest town ( and the second largest town in Lothian after Edinburgh ) is now Livingston .",
  "/wiki/Cist": "A cist ( /\u02c8s\u026ast/ or /\u02c8k\u026ast/ ; also kist /\u02c8k\u026ast/ ; from Greek : \u03ba\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 , Middle Welsh Kist or Germanic Kiste ) is a small stone-built coffin-like box or ossuary used to hold the bodies of the dead . Examples can be found across Europe and in the Middle East . A cist may have been associated with other monuments , perhaps under a cairn or long barrow . Several cists are sometimes found close together within the same cairn or barrow . Often ornaments have been found within an excavated cist , indicating the wealth or prominence of the interred individual . This old word is preserved in the Swedish language , where kista is the word for a funerary coffin .",
  "/wiki/British_Iron_Age": "The British Iron Age is a conventional name used in the archaeology of Great Britain , referring to the prehistoric and protohistoric phases of the Iron Age culture of the main island and the smaller islands , typically excluding prehistoric Ireland , which had an independent Iron Age culture of its own . The parallel phase of Irish archaeology is termed the Irish Iron Age . The Iron Age is not an archaeological horizon of common artefacts , but is rather a locally diverse cultural phase . The British Iron Age lasted in theory from the first significant use of iron for tools and weapons in Britain to the Romanisation of the southern half of the island . The Romanised culture is termed Roman Britain and is considered to supplant the British Iron Age . The Irish Iron Age was ended by the rise of Christianity . The tribes living in Britain during this time are often popularly considered to be part of a broadly Celtic culture , but in recent years this has been disputed . At a minimum , Celtic is a linguistic term without an implication of a lasting cultural unity connecting Gaul with the British Isles throughout the Iron Age . The Brythonic languages spoken in Britain at this time , as well as others including the Goidelic and Gaulish languages of neighbouring Ireland and Gaul respectively , certainly belong to the group known as Celtic languages . However it can not be assumed that particular cultural features found in one Celtic-speaking culture can be extrapolated to the others .",
  "/wiki/Christian_era": "The terms anno Domini [ note 1 ] ( AD ) and before Christ [ note 2 ] ( BC ) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars . The term anno Domini is Medieval Latin and means in the year of the Lord , but is often presented using our Lord instead of the Lord , taken from the full original phrase anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi , which translates to in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ . This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth , with AD counting years from the start of this epoch , and BC denoting years before the start of the era . There is no year zero in this scheme , so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC . This dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor , but was not widely used until after 800 . The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today . For decades , it has been the unofficial global standard , adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication , transportation , and commercial integration , and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations . Traditionally , English followed Latin usage by placing the AD abbreviation before the year number . [ note 3 ] However , BC is placed after the year number ( for example : AD 2020 , but 68 BC ) , which also preserves syntactic order . The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium , as in fourth century AD or second millennium AD ( although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions ) . Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ , it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death , i.e. , after the death of Jesus . However , this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales .",

  "/wiki/Quartz": "Quartz is a hard , crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms . The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra , giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2 . Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth 's continental crust , behind feldspar . Quartz exists in two forms , the normal \u03b1-quartz and the high-temperature \u03b2-quartz , both of which are chiral . The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 \u00b0C ( 846 K ; 1,063 \u00b0F ) . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume , it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold . There are many different varieties of quartz , several of which are semi-precious gemstones . Since antiquity , varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings , especially in Eurasia .",

  "/wiki/Clava_cairn": "The Clava cairn is a type of Bronze Age circular chamber tomb cairn , named after the group of three cairns at Balnuaran of Clava , to the east of Inverness in Scotland . There are about 50 cairns of this type in an area round about Inverness . They fall into two sub-types , one typically consisting of a corbelled passage grave with a single burial chamber linked to the entrance by a short passage and covered with a cairn of stones , with the entrances oriented south west towards midwinter sunset . In the other sub-type an annular ring cairn encloses an apparently unroofed area with no formal means of access from the outside . In both sub-types a stone circle surrounds the whole tomb and a kerb often runs around the cairn . The heights of the standing stones vary in height so that the tallest fringe the entrance ( oriented south west ) and the shortest are directly opposite it . Where Clava-type tombs have still contained burial remains , only one or two bodies appear to have been buried in each , and the lack of access to the second sub-type suggests that there was no intention of re-visiting the dead or communally adding future burials as had been the case with Neolithic cairn tombs .",
  "/wiki/Chamber_tomb": "A chamber tomb is a tomb for burial used in many different cultures . In the case of individual burials , the chamber is thought to signify a higher status for the interree than a simple grave . Built from rock or sometimes wood , the chambers could also serve as places for storage of the dead from one family or social group and were often used over long periods for multiple burials . Most chamber tombs were constructed from large stones or megaliths and covered by cairns , barrows or earth . Some chamber tombs are rock-cut monuments or wooden-chambered tombs covered with earth barrows . Grave goods are a common characteristic of chamber tomb burials . In Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe , stone-built examples of these burials are known by the generic term of megalithic tombs . Chamber tombs are often distinguished by the layout of their chambers and entrances or the shape and material of the structure that covered them , either an earth barrow or stone cairn . A wide variety of local types has been identified , and some designs appear to have influenced others .",

It is the administrative centre for The Highland Council and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands . Historically it served as the county town of the county of Inverness-shire . Inverness lies near two important battle sites : the 11th-century battle of Bl\u00e0r nam F\u00e8inne against Norway which took place on the Aird , and the 18th century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor . It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen ( Gleann M\u00f2r ) at its northeastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Moray Firth . At the latest , a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted by Dab\u00edd mac Ma\u00edl Choluim ( King David I ) in the 12th century . The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findl\u00e1ich ( MacBeth ) whose 11th-century killing of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare 's largely fictionalized play Macbeth , held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross .

  "/wiki/Mummy": "A mummy is a dead human or an animal whose skin and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals , extreme cold , very low humidity , or lack of air , so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions . Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals , but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD ( see the section Etymology and meaning ) . Mummies of humans and animals have been found on every continent , both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions , and as cultural artifacts . Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt , many of which are cats . Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are sacred ibis , and radiocarbon dating suggests the Egyptian Ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC . In addition to the mummies of ancient Egypt , deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates .

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

Excavations have shown it was occupied in the Late Iron Age from about AD 40 until the last quarter of the 2nd century ( about the time that the Antonine Wall was manned ) . Following the Roman withdrawal to Hadrian 's Wall , it was predominantly uninterruptedly occupied from about 220 until about 400 when the rampart was replaced by one more impressive . [ clarification needed ] The site was abandoned after a few decades . In the 1st century AD the Romans recorded the Votadini as a British tribe in the area , and Traprain Law is generally thought to have been one of their major settlements ; named Curia by Ptolemy . They emerged as a kingdom under the Brythonic version of their name Gododdin and Traprain Law is thought to have been their capital before moving to Din Eidyn ( Castle Rock in modern Edinburgh ) .",
  "/wiki/Hill_fort": "A hillfort is a type of earthworks used as a fortified refuge or defended settlement , located to exploit a rise in elevation for defensive advantage . They are typically European and of the Bronze and Iron Ages . Some were used in the post-Roman period . The fortification usually follows the contours of a hill , consisting of one or more lines of earthworks , with stockades or defensive walls , and external ditches . Hillforts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC , and were used in many Celtic areas of central and western Europe until the Roman conquest .",

Their territory was in what is now south-east Scotland and north-east England , extending from the Firth of Forth and around modern Stirling to the River Tyne , including at its peak what are now the Falkirk , Lothian and Borders regions and Northumberland . This area was briefly part of the Roman province of Britannia . The earliest known capital of the Votadini appears to have been the Traprain Law hill fort in East Lothian , until that was abandoned in the early 5th century . They afterwards moved to Din Eidyn ( Edinburgh ) . The name is recorded as Votadini in classical sources . Their descendants were the early medieval kingdom known in Old Welsh as Guotodin , and in later Welsh as Gododdin [ \u0261o\u02c8do\u00f0in ] . One of the oldest known pieces of British literature is a poem called Y Gododdin , written in Old Welsh , having previously been passed down via the oral traditions of the Brythonic speaking Britons . This poem celebrates the bravery of the soldiers from what was later referred to by the Britons as Yr Hen Ogledd - The Old North ; a reference to the fact that this land was lost in battle to an invading force at Catraeth ( modern day Catterick ) .",

[ d ] The capital and largest city is Reykjav\u00edk . Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population . Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark , and Sweden .",
  "/wiki/Hekla": "Hekla ( Icelandic pronunciation : \u200b [ \u02c8h\u025b\u02b0kla ] ( listen ) ) , or Hecla , is a stratovolcano in the south of Iceland with a height of 1,491 m ( 4,892 ft ) . Hekla is one of Iceland 's most active volcanoes ; over 20 eruptions have occurred in and around the volcano since 874 . During the Middle Ages , Europeans called the volcano the Gateway to Hell . Hekla is part of a volcanic ridge , 40 km ( 25 mi ) long . The most active part of this ridge , a fissure about 5.5 km ( 3.4 mi ) long named Heklugj\u00e1 , is considered to be within Hekla proper . Hekla looks rather like an overturned boat , with its keel being a series of craters , two of which are generally the most active . The volcano 's frequent large eruptions have covered much of Iceland with tephra , and these layers can be used to date eruptions of Iceland 's other volcanoes . Approximately 10% of the tephra created in Iceland in the last thousand years has come from Hekla , amounting to 5 km3 . Cumulatively , the volcano has produced one of the largest volumes of lava of any in the world in the last millennium , around 8 km3 .",
  "/wiki/Volcano": "A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object , such as Earth , that allows hot lava , volcanic ash , and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface . Earth 's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major , rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter , softer layer in its mantle . Therefore , on Earth , volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging , and most are found underwater . For example , a mid-oceanic ridge , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates . Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust 's plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America . This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of plate hypothesis volcanism . Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called hotspots , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core-mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth . Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .",

[ Note 1 ] The island 's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillin , the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country . Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name 's origins . The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period , and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald . The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms , some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands . Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century . Skye 's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 . About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001 , and although their numbers are in decline , this aspect of island culture remains important . The main industries are tourism , agriculture , fishing and forestry . Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area .

  "/wiki/Forge": "A forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals , or the workplace ( smithy ) where such a hearth is located . The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging , or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs . The metal ( known as the workpiece ) is transported to and from the forge using tongs , which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy 's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer . Sometimes , such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands , the workpiece is transported to the slack tub , which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water . However , depending on the metal type , it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead ; many metals require more than plain water hardening . The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge .",
  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile archery platforms , for hunting or for racing , and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people . The word chariot comes from the Latin term carrus , a loanword from Gaulish . A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a car . In ancient Rome and some other ancient Mediterranean civilizations , a biga required two horses , a triga three , and a quadriga four . The chariot was a fast , light , open , two-wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side , and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides . It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages ; but , after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry , as horses were gradually bred to be bigger , the chariot was used for travel , in processions , for games , and in races . The critical invention that allowed the construction of light , horse-drawn chariots was the spoked wheel . The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca . 2000 BC . The use of chariots peaked around 1300 BC ( see Battle of Kadesh ) .

In organology , lyre is defined as a yoke lute , being a lute in which the strings are attached to a yoke that lies in the same plane as the sound-table and consists of two arms and a cross-bar . In Ancient Greece , recitations of lyric poetry were accompanied by lyre playing . The earliest picture of a lyre with seven strings appears in the famous sarcophagus of Hagia Triada ( a Minoan settlement in Crete ) . The sarcophagus was used during the Mycenaean occupation of Crete ( c. 1400 BC ) . The lyre of classical antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum ( pick ) , like a guitar or a zither , rather than being plucked with the fingers as with a harp .
