  "/wiki/Old_Malay": "Malay is a major language of the Austronesian language family . Over a period of two millennia , from a form that probably consisted of only 157 original words , [ clarification needed ] Malay has undergone various stages of development that derived from different layers of foreign influences through international trade , religious expansion , colonisation and developments of new socio-political trends . The oldest form of Malay is descended from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by the earliest Austronesian settlers in Southeast Asia . This form would later evolved into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region . Old Malay contained some terms that exist today , but are unintelligible to modern speakers , while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay of 1303 CE . Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary , when Islam made its way to the region . Initially , Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects , reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia . One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of Melaka in the 15th century , eventually became predominant . The strong influence of Melaka in international trade in the region resulted in Malay as a lingua franca in commerce and diplomacy , a status that it maintained throughout the age of the succeeding Malay sultanates , the European colonial era and the modern times . From 19th to 20th century , Malay evolved progressively through a significant grammatical improvements and lexical enrichment into a modern language with more than 800,000 phrases in various disciplines",
