  "/wiki/Communes_of_France": "The commune ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ k\u0254myn ] ) is a level of administrative division in the French Republic . French communes are analogous to civil townships and incorporated municipalities in the United States and Canada , Gemeinden in Germany , comuni in Italy or ayuntamiento in Spain . The United Kingdom has no exact equivalent , as communes resemble districts in urban areas , but are closer to parishes in rural areas where districts are much larger . Communes are based on historical geographic communities or villages and are vested with significant powers to manage the populations and land of the geographic area covered . The communes are the fourth-level administrative divisions of France . Communes vary widely in size and area , from large sprawling cities with millions of inhabitants like Paris , to small hamlets with only a handful of inhabitants . Communes typically are based on pre-existing villages and facilitate local governance . All communes have names , but not all named geographic areas or groups of people residing together are communes ( lieu dit or bourg ) , the difference residing in the lack of administrative powers . Except for the municipal arrondissements of its largest cities , the communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France and are governed by elected officials ( mayor and a conseil municipal ) with extensive autonomous powers to implement national policy",
