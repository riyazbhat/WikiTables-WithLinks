Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club , the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception .

The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world . Real Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 , along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona . The club holds many long-standing rivalries , most notably El Cl\u00e1sico with Barcelona and El Derbi with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid . Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s , winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times . This success was replicated in the league , which the club won five times in the space of seven years . This team , which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano , Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s , Francisco Gento , and Raymond Kopa , is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time .",

Ajax won the competition without losing a game , either in the group or the knock-out stage in winning the title for the first time since 1973 .

This year included four groups of four teams each in the group stage , up from two groups of four teams each in 1993-94 . It was also the first year in which eight teams advanced to the knock-out stage and the first of three years in which smaller clubs entered the UEFA Cup instead of the Champions League .
