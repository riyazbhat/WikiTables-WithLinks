The former tea storehouse was originally owned by the McDonaghs , one of Galways famous merchant families .

In 2011 , following extensive refurbishment , what was originally known as the Druid Theatre was renamed The Mick Lally Theatre in memory of Druid co-founder , the late Mick Lally .

  "/wiki/The_Tempest": "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare , probably written in 1610-1611 , and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone . After the first scene , which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest , the rest of the story is set on a remote island , where the sorcerer Prospero , a complex and contradictory character , lives with his daughter Miranda , and his two servants - Caliban , a savage monster figure , and Ariel , an airy spirit . The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island . It explores many themes , including magic , betrayal , revenge , and family . In Act IV , a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play , and contributes spectacle , allegory , and elevated language . Though The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare 's comedies , it deals with both tragic and comic themes , and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare 's late plays . The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations - from those that see it as a fable of art and creation , with Prospero representing Shakespeare , and Prospero 's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage , to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands .",
  "/wiki/Ariel_(The_Tempest)": "Ariel is a spirit who appears in William Shakespeare 's play The Tempest . Ariel is bound to serve the magician Prospero , who rescued him from the tree in which he was imprisoned by Sycorax , the witch who previously inhabited the island . Prospero greets disobedience with a reminder that he saved Ariel from Sycorax 's spell , and with promises to grant Ariel his freedom . Ariel is Prospero 's eyes and ears throughout the play , using his magical abilities to cause the tempest in Act One which gives the play its name , and to foil other characters ' plots to bring down his master . Ariels name means Lion of God . Ariel may also be a simple play on the word aerial . Scholars have compared him to sprites depicted in other Elizabethan plays , and have managed to find several similarities between them , but one thing which makes Ariel unique is the human edge and personality given to him by Shakespeare . Because the stage directions in The Tempest are so precise , critics and historians are better able to see how this play may have originally been performed than with other Shakespeare plays . Several of the scenes involving magic have clear instructions on how to create the illusion required , causing critics to make connections and guesses as to exactly what sort of technology would have been used in Shakespeare 's troupe to stage Ariel 's role in the play . Also , a line by Ariel in Act IV allows scholars to ask if the original actor for Ariel also played the part of Ceres , due to a shortage of boy actors . Ariel is widely viewed as a male character , although this view has wavered over the years , especially in the Restoration , when , for the most part , women played the role .",
