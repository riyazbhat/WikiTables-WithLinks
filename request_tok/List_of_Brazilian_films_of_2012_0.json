  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio",

Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character 's real name is used . They differ from docudrama films and historical drama films in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person 's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives . [ original research ? ] Because the figures portrayed are actual people , whose actions and characteristics are known to the public ( or at least historically documented ) , biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses . [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley , Johnny Depp , Jim Carrey , Robert Downey Jr. , Jamie Foxx and Eddie Redmayne all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics : [ citation needed ] Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi ( 1982 ) , Depp as Ed Wood in Ed Wood ( 1994 ) , Carrey as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon ( 1999 ) , Downey as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin ( 1992 ) , Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray ( 2004 ) , and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything ( 2014 ) .

Biopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis . Custen , in Bio/Pics : How Hollywood Constructed Public History ( 1992 ) , regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era , and in particular , Darryl F. Zanuck . On the other hand , Bingham 's 2010 study Whose Lives Are They Anyway ? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study , Film/Genre . Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other , the former generally dealing with great accomplishments , the latter generally dealing with female victimization",

  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity .

  "/wiki/Animation": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize .
