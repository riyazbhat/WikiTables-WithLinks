There are two main models , the original F-5A and F-5B Freedom Fighter variants and the extensively updated F-5E and F-5F Tiger II variants . The design team wrapped a small , highly aerodynamic fighter around two compact and high-thrust General Electric J85 engines , focusing on performance and a low cost of maintenance . Smaller and simpler than contemporaries such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II , the F-5 cost less to procure and operate , making it a popular export aircraft . Though primarily designed for a day air superiority role , the aircraft is also a capable ground-attack platform . The F-5A entered service in the early 1960s . During the Cold War , over 800 were produced through 1972 for U.S. allies . Though at the time , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) did not have a need for a light fighter , it did procure approximately 1,200 Northrop T-38 Talon trainer aircraft , which was based on Northrop 's N-156 fighter design . After winning the International Fighter Aircraft Competition , a program aimed at providing effective low-cost fighters to American allies , in 1970 , Northrop introduced the second-generation F-5E Tiger II in 1972 . This upgrade included more powerful engines , larger fuel capacity , greater wing area and improved leading edge extensions for better turn rates , optional air-to-air refueling , and improved avionics including air-to-air radar .

  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Vampire": "The de Havilland Vampire is a British jet fighter developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company . It was the second jet fighter to be operated by the RAF , after the Gloster Meteor , and the first to be powered by a single jet engine . Work on the Vampire commenced during 1941 in the midst of the Second World War ; it was initially intended as an experimental aircraft , albeit one that was suitable for combat , that harnessed the groundbreaking innovation of jet propulsion . Out of the company 's design studies , it was quickly decided to settle on a single-engine , twin-boom aircraft , powered by the Halford H.1 turbojet engine ( later produced as the Goblin ) . Aside from its propulsion system and twin-boom configuration , it was a relatively conventional aircraft . Despite being originally ordered as an experimental aircraft only , during May 1944 , it was decided to mass-produce the aircraft as an interceptor for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . During 1946 , the first production Vampire entered operational service with the RAF , only months after the Second World War had come to an end . The Vampire quickly proved to be an effective aircraft and was adopted as a replacement for many wartime piston-engined fighter aircraft . During its early service , it was recognised for accomplishing several aviation firsts and various records , such as being the first jet aircraft to traverse the Atlantic Ocean . The Vampire remained in front-line service with the RAF up until 1953 ; after this date , it was progressively reassigned to various secondary roles , such as ground attack missions and pilot training operations , for which specialist variants of the type were produced . During 1966 , the Vampire was officially retired by the RAF , having been withdrawn from its final role as an advanced trainer after having been replaced by the Folland Gnat . The Royal Navy had also adopted the type as the Sea Vampire , a navalised variant suitable for operations from its aircraft carriers .",

On 7 September 1953 , the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft , achieving a speed of 727.63 mph ( 1,171.01 km/h ; 632.29 kn ) . The single-seat Hunter was introduced to service in 1954 as a manoeuvrable day interceptor aircraft , quickly succeeding first-generation jet fighters in RAF service such as the Gloster Meteor and the de Havilland Venom . The all-weather/night fighter role was filled by the Gloster Javelin . Successively improved variants of the type were produced , adopting increasingly more capable engine models and expanding its fuel capacity amongst other modifications being implemented . Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams : the Black Arrows , who on one occasion looped a record-breaking 22 Hunters in formation , and later the Blue Diamonds , who flew 16 aircraft . The Hunter was also widely exported , serving with a total of 21 overseas air forces . During the 1960s , following the introduction of the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role , the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a fighter-bomber and for aerial reconnaissance missions , using dedicated variants for these purposes . Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s . Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service , being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014 .

It was the first Western European combat aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in horizontal flight . During 1952 , the French government issued its specification , calling for a lightweight , all-weather interceptor . Amongst the respondents were Dassault with their design , initially known as the Mirage I . Following favourable flight testing held during 1954 , in which speeds of up to Mach 1.6 were attained , it was decided that a larger follow-on aircraft would be required to bear the necessary equipment and payloads . An enlarged Mirage II proposal was considered , as well as MD 610 Cavalier ( 3 versions ) , but was discarded in favour of a further-developed design , powered by the newly developed Snecma Atar afterburning turbojet engine , designated as the Mirage III . During October 1960 , the first major production model , designated as the Mirage IIIC , performed its maiden flight . Initial operational deliveries of this model commenced during July 1961 ; a total of 95 Mirage IIICs were obtained by the French Air Force ( Arm\u00e9e de l'Air , AdA ) . The Mirage IIIC was rapidly followed by numerous other variants . The Mirage III was produced in large numbers for both the French Air Force and a wide number of export customers . Prominent overseas operators of the fighter included Argentina , Australia , South Africa , Pakistan and Israel , as well as a number of non-aligned nations . Often considered to be a second-generation fighter aircraft , the Mirage III experienced a lengthy service life with several of these operators ; for some time , the type remained a fairly maneuverable aircraft and an effective opponent when engaged in close-range dogfighting .",
