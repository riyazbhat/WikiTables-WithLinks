  "/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Love": "All You Need Is Love is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967 . It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon-McCartney partnership . The song was Britain 's contribution to Our World , the first live global television link , for which the band were filmed performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June . The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries . Lennon 's lyrics were deliberately simplistic , to allow for the show 's international audience , and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love . The single topped sales charts in Britain , the United States and many other countries , and became an anthem for the counterculture 's embrace of flower power philosophy . The performance took place at the height of the Beatles ' popularity and influence , following the release of their album Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Rather than perform the song entirely live on Our World , the group played to a pre-recorded backing track . With an orchestral arrangement by George Martin , the song begins with a portion of the French national anthem and ends with musical quotations from works such as Glenn Miller 's In the Mood , Greensleeves , Bach 's Invention No . 8 in F major , and the Beatles ' 1963 hit She Loves You . Adding to the festive atmosphere of the broadcast , the studio was adorned with signs and streamers , and filled with guests dressed in psychedelic attire , including members of the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Small Faces .",

It was not released as an eleven-track LP in the UK until 1976 . In their new songs , the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver ( 1966 ) . Paul McCartney led the project and contributed three songs , while John Lennon and George Harrison contributed I Am the Walrus and Blue Jay Way , respectively . The sessions were often characterised as aimless and undisciplined , including by producer George Martin , whose input on the band 's recordings began to wane . Further to the Beatles ' desire to experiment with record formats and packaging , the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet that contained song lyrics , colour photos from film production , and colour story illustrations by Beatles Book cartoonist Bob Gibson . Despite widespread media criticism of the Magical Mystery Tour film , the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success . In the UK , it topped the EPs chart compiled by Record Retailer and peaked at number 2 on the magazine 's singles chart ( later the UK Singles Chart ) behind the band 's Hello , Goodbye . The album topped Billboard 's Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969 .",

Abbey Road 's most notable client was the Beatles , who used the studio - particularly its Studio Two room - as the venue for many of the innovative recording techniques that they adopted throughout the 1960s . In 1970 , the studio was renamed from EMI in honour of the group 's 1969 album Abbey Road . In 2009 , Abbey Road came under threat of sale to property developers .

In August 1966 , the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday .

  "/wiki/Within_You_Without_You": "Within You Without You is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Written by lead guitarist George Harrison , it was Harrison 's second composition in the Indian classical style , after Love You To , and was inspired by his stay in India in late 1966 with his mentor and sitar teacher , Ravi Shankar . Recorded in London without the other Beatles , the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar , dilruba and tabla , and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle . The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles ' previous work ; musically , it evokes the Indian devotional tradition , while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison 's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas . The song was Harrison 's only composition on Sgt . Pepper , although his endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover . With the worldwide success of the album , Within You Without You presented Indian classical music to a new audience in the West and contributed to the genre 's peak in international popularity . It also influenced the philosophical direction of many of Harrison 's peers during an era of utopian idealism marked by the Summer of Love . The song has traditionally received a varied response from music critics , some of whom find it lacklustre and pretentious , while others admire its musical authenticity and consider the message to be the most meaningful on Sgt . Pepper . Writing for Rolling Stone , David Fricke described the track as being at once beautiful and severe , a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility in the middle of a record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy .",

The song was a number 1 hit in Australia when released on a single there in 1966 , coupled with Nowhere Man . Lennon wrote the song as a veiled account of an extramarital affair he had in London . When recording the track , Harrison chose to add a sitar part after becoming interested in the instrument 's exotic sound while on the set of the Beatles ' film Help ! , in early 1965 . Further to several British bands , including the Beatles , using guitars to imitate the drone and other musical textures of the sitar in their recordings , Norwegian Wood was influential in the development of raga rock and psychedelic rock during the mid 1960s . The song also helped elevate Ravi Shankar and Indian classical music to mainstream popularity in the West . Many other rock and pop artists , including the Byrds , the Rolling Stones and Donovan , began integrating elements of the genre into their musical approach . Norwegian Wood is also recognised as a key work in the early evolution of world music .",

Often referred to as a folk rock album , particularly in its Capitol configuration , Rubber Soul incorporates a mix of pop , soul and folk musical styles . The title derives from the colloquialism plastic soul and was the Beatles ' way of acknowledging their lack of authenticity compared to the African-American soul artists they admired . After A Hard Day 's Night in 1964 , it was the second Beatles LP to contain only original material . The songs demonstrate the Beatles ' increasing maturity as lyricists and , in their incorporation of brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as sitar , harmonium and fuzz bass , the group striving for more expressive sounds and arrangements for their music .
