During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture",

Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites .

  "/wiki/Capital_goods": "A capital good ( also called complex products and systems or ( CoPS ) ) is a durable good that is used in the production of goods or services . Capital goods are one of the three types of producer goods , the other two being land and labour . The three are also known collectively as primary factors of production This classification originated during the classical economics period and has remained the dominant method for classification . Many definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature . Capital goods are generally considered one-of-a-kind , capital intensive products that consist of many components . They are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves . Examples include hand tools , machine tools , data centers , oil rigs , semiconductor fabrication plants , and wind turbines . Their production is often organized in projects , with several parties cooperating in networks ( Hicks et al . 2000 ; Hicks and McGovern 2009 ; Hobday 1998 ) . A capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering , engineering and procurement , manufacturing , commissioning , maintenance and ( sometimes ) decommissioning . In terms of economics , capital goods are tangible property . A society acquires capital goods by saving wealth that can be invested in the means of production"
