South Sudan is bordered by Sudan to the north , Ethiopia to the east , Kenya to the southeast , Uganda to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest and the Central African Republic to the west . It includes the vast swamp region of the Sudd , formed by the White Nile and known locally as the Bahr al Jabal ( Arabic : \u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0644 ) , meaning Mountain Sea . Sudan was occupied by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty and was governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until Sudanese independence in 1956 . Following the First Sudanese Civil War , the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983 . A second Sudanese civil war soon broke out , ending in 2005 with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement . Later that year , southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed . South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011 , following 98.83 % support for independence in a January 2011 referendum . It has suffered ethnic violence and endured a civil war since 2013 .

It is Angola 's primary port , and its major industrial , cultural and urban centre . Located on Angola 's northern coast with the Atlantic Ocean , Luanda is both Angola 's chief seaport and its administrative centre . It is also the capital city of Luanda Province . Luanda and its metropolitan area is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world , with over 8 million inhabitants in 2019 ( a third of Angola 's population ) . Among the oldest colonial cities of Africa , it was founded in January 1576 as S\u00e3o Paulo da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o de Loanda by Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais . The city served as the centre of the slave trade to Brazil before its prohibition . At the start of the Angolan Civil War in 1975 , most of the white Portuguese left as refugees , principally for Portugal . Luanda 's population increased greatly from refugees fleeing the war , but its infrastructure was inadequate to handle the increase . This also caused the exacerbation of slums , or musseques , around Luanda . The city is currently undergoing a major reconstruction , with many large developments taking place that will alter its cityscape significantly . The industries present in the city include the processing of agricultural products , beverage production , textile , cement , newly car assembly plants , construction materials , plastics , metallurgy , cigarettes and shoes .",

It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25 % since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
