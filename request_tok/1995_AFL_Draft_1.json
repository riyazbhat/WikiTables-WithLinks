The decision of the club to change its name to the Lions in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996 . Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again .
