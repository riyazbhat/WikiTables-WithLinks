  "/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America": "The Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) ( colloquially , the Boy Scouts ) is the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States , with about 2.3 million youth participants and about one million adult volunteers . The BSA was founded in 1910 , and since then , about 110 million Americans participated in BSA programs at some time in their lives . BSA is part of the international Scout Movement and became a founding member organization of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922 . The stated mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law . Youth are trained in responsible citizenship , character development , and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities , educational programs , and , at older age levels , career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations . For younger members , the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness , good citizenship , and outdoors skills , through a variety of activities such as camping , aquatics , and hiking . To further these outdoor activities , the BSA has four high-adventure bases : Northern Tier ( Minnesota , Manitoba , and Ontario ) , Philmont Scout Ranch ( New Mexico ) , Sea Base ( Florida , US Virgin Islands , and Bahamas ) , and Summit Bechtel Reserve ( West Virginia ) , as well as nearly one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts . The traditional Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for ages 5 to 11 years , Scouts BSA for ages 11 to 18 , Venturing for ages 14 through 21 , and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21 . The BSA operates traditional Scouting by chartering local organizations , such as churches , clubs , civic associations , or educational organization , to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities . Units are led entirely by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization , who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers . Additionally , Learning for Life is a non-traditional affiliate that provides in-school and career education . On February 1 , 2019 , the Boy Scouts of America renamed their flagship program , Boy Scouts , to Scouts BSA to reflect their change of policy to allow girls to join in separate , gender-specific troops",

Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing ( V/STOL ) , the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier , the first operational V/STOL aircraft . The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions , ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance . The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) , the Spanish Navy , and the Italian Navy . A variant of the AV-8B , the British Aerospace Harrier II , was developed for the British military , while another , the TAV-8B , is a dedicated two-seat trainer . The project that eventually led to the AV-8B 's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom ( UK ) , aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier . Early efforts centered on a larger , more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier . Due to budgetary constraints , the UK abandoned the project in 1975 . Following the withdrawal of the UK , McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B . While retaining the general layout of its predecessor , the aircraft incorporates a new wing , an elevated cockpit , a redesigned fuselage , one extra hardpoint per wing , and other structural and aerodynamic refinements . The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus , which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability .

  "/wiki/Psychiatrist": "A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry , the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis , prevention , study , and treatment of mental disorders . Psychiatrists are medical doctors , unlike psychologists , and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness , a combination of physical and mental ailments , or strictly psychiatric . A psychiatrist usually works as the clinical leader of the multi-disciplinary team , which may comprise psychologists , social workers , occupational therapists and nursing staff . Psychiatrists have broad training in a bio-psycho-social approach to assessment and management of mental illness . As part of the clinical assessment process , psychiatrists may employ a mental status examination ; a physical examination ; brain imaging such as a computerized tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan ; and blood testing . Psychiatrists prescribe medicine , and may also use psychotherapy , although they could also primarily concentrate on medical management and refer to a psychologist or other specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy",
