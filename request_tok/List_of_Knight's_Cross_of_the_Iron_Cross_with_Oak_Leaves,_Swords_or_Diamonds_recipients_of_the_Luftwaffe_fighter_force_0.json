  "/wiki/Military_reserve_force": "A military reserve force is a military organization composed of citizen-soldiers of a country who combine a military role or career with a civilian career . They are not normally kept under arms and their main role is to be available to fight when their military requires additional manpower . Reserve forces are generally considered part of a permanent standing body of armed forces . The existence of reserve forces allows a nation to reduce its peacetime military expenditures while maintaining a force prepared for war . It is analogous to the historical model of military recruitment before the era of standing armies . In some countries , such as Canada , United States , Spain and the United Kingdom , members of the reserve forces are civilians who maintain military skills by training , typically one weekend a month . They may do so as individuals or as members of standing reserve regiments , for example the Army Reserve of the United Kingdom . In some cases a militia , home guard , state guard , or State Military could constitute part of a military reserve forces , such as the United States National Guard , the Norwegian Home Guard , the Swedish Home Guard , or the Danish Home Guard . In Colombia , Israel , Norway , Singapore , South Korea , Sweden and Taiwan service in the reserves is compulsory for a number of years after one has completed national service .

For example , a Feuerwehrhauptmann is the captain of a fire brigade , while R\u00e4uberhauptmann refers to the leader of a gang of robbers . Official Austrian and German titles incorporating the word include Landeshauptmann , Bezirkshauptmann , Burghauptmann , and Berghauptmann . In Saxony during the Weimar Republic , the titles of Kreishauptmann , and Amtshauptmann were held by senior civil servants .
