Operating out of U.N. headquarters in New York City , it is among the most widespread and recognizable social welfare organizations in the world , with a presence in 192 countries and territories . UNICEF 's activities include immunizations and disease prevention , administering treatment for children and mothers with HIV , enhancing childhood and maternal nutrition , improving sanitation , promoting education , and providing emergency relief in response to disasters . UNICEF has its origins in the International Childrens Emergency Fund ( ICEF ) , created in 1946 by the U.N . Relief Rehabilitation Administration to provide immediate relief and healthcare to children and mothers affected by World War II . The same year , at the urging of Polish physician Ludwik Rajchman , the U.N. General Assembly established the United Nations International Children 's Emergency Fund ( UNICEF ) to further institutionalize its post-war relief work . In 1950 , UNICEF 's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women , particularly in developing countries , and in 1953 it became a permanent part of the United Nations System . The agency 's name was subsequently changed to its current form , though it retains the original acronym . UNICEF relies entirely on contributions from governments and private donors . Its total income as of 2018 was $ 5.2 billion , of which two-thirds came from governments ; private groups and individuals contributed the rest through national committees . It is governed by a 36-member executive board that establishes policies , approves programs , and oversees administrative and financial plans .

The concerts were attended by a total of 40,000 people , and the initial gate receipts raised close to $ 250,000 for Bangladesh relief , which was administered by UNICEF . After collecting the musicians easily , Harrison found it extremely difficult to get the recording industry to release the rights for performers to share the stage , and millions of dollars raised from the album and film were tied up in IRS tax escrow accounts for years , but the Concert for Bangladesh is recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project , generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons and inspiration for projects that followed , such as Live Aid . By 1985 , through revenue raised from the Concert for Bangladesh live album and film , an estimated $ 12 million had been sent to Bangladesh , and sales of the live album and DVD release of the film continue to benefit the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF . Decades later , Shankar would say of the overwhelming success of the event : In one day , the whole world knew the name of Bangladesh . It was a fantastic occasion",
