The settlement was founded by Spaniards of the Franciscan order on The Feast of the Birth of Mary , September 8 , 1771 , as the fourth of what would become 21 Spanish missions in California . San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel , named after the Archangel Gabriel and often referred to as the Godmother of the Pueblo of Los Angeles , was designed by Antonio Cruzado , who hailed from C\u00f3rdoba , Spain . Cruzado gave the building its strong Moorish architectural influence . The capped buttresses and the tall , narrow windows are unique among the missions of the California chain . A large stone cross stands in the center of the Campo Santo ( cemetery ) , first consecrated in 1778 and then again on January 29 , 1939 , by the Los Angeles Archbishop John Cantwell . It serves as the final resting place for some 6,000 neophytes ; a small stone marker denotes the gravesite of Jos\u00e9 de Los Santos , the last American Indian to be buried on the grounds , at the age of 101 in February 1921 . Also interred at the Mission are the bodies of numerous Franciscan priests who died during their time of service , as well as the remains of Reverend Raymond Catalan , C.M.F. , who undertook the restoration of the Mission 's gardens . Entombed at the foot of the altar are the remains of eight Franciscan priests ( listed in order of interment ) : Miguel S\u00e1nchez , Antonio Cruzado , Francisco Dumetz , Roman Ulibarri , Joaquin P. Nunez , Ger\u00f3nimo Boscana , Jos\u00e9 Bernardo S\u00e1nchez , and Blas Ordaz . Buried among the priests is centenarian Eulalia Perez de Guill\u00e9n Marin\u00e9 , the keeper of the keys under Spanish rule ; her grave is marked by a bench dedicated in her memory . According to Spanish legend , the founding expedition was confronted by a large group of native Tongva peoples whose intention was to drive the strangers away . One of the priests laid a painting of Our Lady of Sorrows on the ground for all to see , whereupon the natives , designated by the settlers as the Gabrieli\u00f1os , immediately made peace with the missionaries , because they were so moved by the painting 's beauty .",
