  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",
  "/wiki/Weimar_Republic": "The Weimar Republic ( German : Weimarer Republik [ \u02c8va\u026ama\u0281\u0250 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k ] ( listen ) ) is an unofficial historical designation for the German state from 1918 to 1933 . The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",

  "/wiki/Epilepsy": "Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures . Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking . These episodes can result in physical injuries , including occasionally broken bones . In epilepsy , seizures have a tendency to recur and , as a rule , have no immediate underlying cause . Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy . People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition . The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown . Some cases occur as the result of brain injury , stroke , brain tumors , infections of the brain , or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis . Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases . Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain . The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms , such as fainting , and determining if another cause of seizures is present , such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems . This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests .",

In such cases , a person destroys their own property by burning it and then lies about the cause in order to collect against their insurance policy . A person who commits arson is called an 'arsonist ' . Arsonists normally use an accelerant ( such as gasoline or kerosene ) to ignite , propel and directionalize fires , and the detection and identification of ignitable liquid residues ( ILRs ) is an important part of fire investigations .

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

As per Indian government population census of 2011 , Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai . Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region , the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23.64 million . Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour . In 2008 , Mumbai was named an alpha world city . It is also the wealthiest city in India , and has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India . Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Elephanta Caves , Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus , and the city 's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings . The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people , who originated in Gujarat in prehistoric times . For centuries , the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay . During the mid-18th century , Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project , which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea . Along with construction of major roads and railways , the reclamation project , completed in 1845 , transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea .",

Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area 's economy have ranged from $ 60 to $ 150 billion ( GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity ) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India , after Mumbai and Delhi . In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi .

  "/wiki/Vampire": "A vampire is a creature from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital essence ( generally in the form of blood ) of the living . In European folklore , vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighborhoods they inhabited while they were alive . They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance , markedly different from today 's gaunt , pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century . Vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures ; the term vampire was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in the Balkans and Eastern Europe that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism . Local variants in Eastern Europe were also known by different names , such as shtriga in Albania , vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania . In modern times , the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity , although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures . Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body 's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this , creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death . Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure , but has since been largely discredited . The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of The Vampyre by the English writer John Polidori ; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century . Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend , even though it was published after Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu 's 1872 novel Carmilla . The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre , still popular in the 21st century , with books , films , television shows , and video games . The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary": "The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the 20th century ( 1000-1946 with the exception of 1918-1920 ) . The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000 ; his family ( the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ) led the monarchy for 300 years . By the 12th century , the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world . Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century , the country was partitioned into three parts : the Habsburg Royal Hungary , Ottoman Hungary , and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania . The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire . From 1867 , territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen . The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918 , after which Hungary became a republic . The kingdom was nominally restored during the Regency of 1920-46 , ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946 . The Kingdom of Hungary was a multiethnic state from its inception until the Treaty of Trianon and it covered what is today Hungary , Slovakia , Transylvania and other parts of Romania , Carpathian Ruthenia ( now part of Ukraine ) , Vojvodina ( now part of Serbia ) , the territory of Burgenland ( now part of Austria ) , Me\u0111imurje ( now part of Croatia ) , Prekmurje ( now part of Slovenia ) and a few villages in Poland . From 1102 it also included Croatia , being in personal union with it , united under the King of Hungary . According to the demographers , about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs , [ neutrality is disputed ] however in the mid 19th century out of a population of 14 million less than 6 million were Hungarian due to the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries .

  "/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) .

It was composed of three parts : the joint army ( Gemeinsame Armee , Common Army , recruited from all parts of the country ) , the Imperial Austrian Landwehr ( recruited from Cisleithania ) , and the Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d ( recruited from Transleithania ) . In the wake of fighting between the Austrian Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom and the two decades of uneasy co-existence following , Hungarian soldiers served either in mixed units or were stationed away from Hungarian areas . With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the new tripartite army was brought into being . It existed until the disestablishment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I in 1918 . The joint Imperial and Royal Army ( kaiserlich und k\u00f6nigliche Armee or k.u.k . ) units were generally poorly trained and had very limited access to new equipment because the governments of the Austrian and Hungarian parts of the empire often preferred to generously fund their own units instead of outfitting all three army branches equally . All of the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g and the Landwehr regiments were composed of three battalions , while the joint army k.u.k . regiments had four . The long-standing white infantry uniforms were replaced in the later half of the 19th century with dark blue tunics , which in turn were replaced by a pike grey uniform used in the initial stages of World War I .

The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 .

He was the first known American serial sex murderer of the twentieth century . Born and raised in San Francisco , California by his devoutly Pentecostal grandmother , Nelson exhibited bizarre behavior as a child , which was compounded by head injuries he sustained in a bicycling accident at age ten . After committing various minor offenses in early adulthood , he was institutionalized in Napa for a time . Nelson began committing numerous rapes and murders in February 1926 , primarily in the West Coast cities of San Francisco and Portland , Oregon . In late 1926 , he moved east , committing multiple rapes and murders in several Midwestern and East Coast cities before moving north into Canada , raping and killing a teenage girl in Winnipeg , Manitoba . After committing his second murder in Winnipeg , he was arrested by Canadian authorities and convicted of both murders , and sentenced to death . He was executed by hanging in Winnipeg in 1928 . In undertaking his crimes , Nelson had a modus operandi : Most of his victims were middle-aged landladies , many of whom he would find through room for rent advertisements . Posing as a mild-mannered and charming Christian drifter , Nelson used the pretext of renting a room in the landladies ' boardinghouses to make contact with them before attacking . Each of his victims were killed via strangulation , and many were raped after death . His penultimate victim , a 14-year-old girl named Lola Cowan , was the only known victim to be significantly mutilated after death .",

Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land .

  "/wiki/Civil_commitment": "Involuntary commitment or civil commitment ( also known informally as sectioning or being sectioned in some jurisdictions , such as the United Kingdom ) is a legal process through which an individual who is deemed by a qualified agent to have symptoms of severe mental disorder is ordered by a court into treatment in a psychiatric hospital ( inpatient ) or in the community ( outpatient ) . Criteria for civil commitment are established by laws which vary between nations . Commitment proceedings often follow a period of emergency hospitalization , during which an individual with acute psychiatric symptoms is confined for a relatively short duration ( e.g . 72 hours ) in a treatment facility for evaluation and stabilization by mental health professionals who may then determine whether further civil commitment is appropriate or necessary . If civil commitment proceedings follow , then the evaluation is presented in a formal court hearing where testimony and other evidence may also be submitted . The subject of the hearing is typically entitled to legal counsel and may challenge a commitment order through habeas corpus . Historically , until the mid-1960 's in most jurisdictions in the United States , all committals to public psychiatric facilities and most committals to private ones were involuntary . Since then , there have been alternating trends towards the abolition or substantial reduction of involuntary commitment , a trend known as deinstitutionalisation .",

  "/wiki/Pedophilia": "Pedophilia ( alternatively spelt paedophilia ) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children . Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11 , and boys at age 11 or 12 , criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13 . A person must be at least 16 years old , and at least five years older than the prepubescent child , for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia . Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty . The International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-11 ) defines it as a sustained , focused , and intense pattern of sexual arousal - as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts , fantasies , urges , or behaviours - involving pre-pubertal children . In popular usage , the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse . This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors . Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided , because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles , child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children , and some pedophiles do not molest children . Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century . A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s . Although mostly documented in men , there are also women who exhibit the disorder , and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles . No cure for pedophilia has been developed , but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse .",
