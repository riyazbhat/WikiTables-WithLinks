The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium . The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs , unlike its competitors , and focused on gaming instead . The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable , which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller . The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 .

It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk .

Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

Punky Skunk was conceived by Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse during his time working at the company , who began creating a mascot action game intended for younger audiences reminiscent of Sony 's Skyblazer on the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software but later settled on doing a new title directed towards western audience with Visit using the same game engine after Bullet-Proof Software changed their direction . The arrival of PlayStation in both eastern and western markets led Ukiyotei with suspending development of the project on Super Famicom before ultimately deciding on making a different version for the former platform , while integrating some of their previously established ideas from the original version into the final release . Upon its release , Punky Skunk was met with a mostly negative reception , with critics panning its visual presentation , audio and gameplay .",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold .

Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability .

  "/wiki/Conker's_Bad_Fur_Day": "Conker 's Bad Fur Day is a platform game developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 console in 2001 . As part of the Conker series , the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel , a greedy , heavy-drinking red squirrel who must return home to his girlfriend . Most of the game requires the player to complete a linear sequence of challenges that involve jumping over obstacles , solving puzzles , and fighting enemies . A multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types is also included . Designed for mature audiences , Conker 's Bad Fur Day features graphic violence , alcohol and tobacco use , profanity , vulgar humor , and pop culture references . Conker 's Bad Fur Day was developed over the course of four years . Although it was originally designed for a family audience , the game was retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare 's earlier platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 . Upon release , Conker 's Bad Fur Day was acclaimed by video game critics , who praised its visual appeal and smart , funny humour . The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64 's life cycle , but has since earned a cult following . A remake , Conker : Live & Reloaded , was released for the Xbox in 2005 . In 2015 , the game was included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One .",
