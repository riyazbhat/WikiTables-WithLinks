After his debut album Infinite ( 1996 ) and the extended play Slim Shady EP ( 1997 ) , Eminem signed with Dr. Dre 's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP and its lead single My Name Is . His next two releases The Marshall Mathers LP ( 2000 ) and The Eminem Show ( 2002 ) were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year . As a result of being a leading figure in a form of black music , Eminem was subject to comparisons to Elvis Presley at the time . After the release of Encore in 2004 , which faced heavy criticism by fans and critics for its lackluster quality , Eminem went on hiatus in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction . He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery the following year , which both won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album . Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide , making it his second album , after The Eminem Show in 2002 , to be the best-selling album worldwide . In the following years , he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 , Revival , Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By . Eminem starred in the drama film 8 Mile ( 2002 ) playing a fictionalized version of himself , which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for Lose Yourself , making him the first hip hop artist to ever win the award .",
