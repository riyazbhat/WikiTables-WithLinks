  "/wiki/Caveat_Emptor": "Caveat emptor ( /\u02c8\u025bmpt\u0254\u02d0r/ ; from caveat , may he beware , a subjunctive form of cav\u0113re , to beware + \u0113mptor , buyer ) is Latin for Let the buyer beware . It has become a proverb in English . Generally , caveat emptor is the contract law principle that controls the sale of real property after the date of closing , but may also apply to sales of other goods . The phrase caveat emptor and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arise from the fact that buyers typically have less information than the seller about the good or service they are purchasing . This quality of the situation is known as 'information asymmetry ' . Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer , and only known to the seller . It is a short form of Caveat emptor , quia ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit ( Let a purchaser beware , for he ought not to be ignorant of the nature of the property which he is buying from another party . ) I.e . the buyer should assure himself that the product is good and that the seller had the right to sell it , as opposed to receiving stolen property . A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding warranty , such as a guarantee of satisfaction . But without such a safeguard in place the ancient rule applies , and the buyer should beware .",

  "/wiki/Ceilings": "A ceiling /\u02c8si\u02d0l\u026a\u014b/ is an overhead interior surface that covers the upper limits of a room . It is not generally considered a structural element , but a finished surface concealing the underside of the roof structure or the floor of a story above . Ceilings can be decorated to taste , and there are many fine examples of frescoes and artwork on ceilings especially in religious buildings . The most common type of ceiling is the dropped ceiling , which is suspended from structural elements above . Panels of drywall are fastened either directly to the ceiling joists or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists . Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling , and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here . Alternatively , ceilings may be spray painted instead , leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted , and using spray foam . A subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling , wherein a network of aluminum struts , as opposed to drywall , are attached to the joists , forming a series of rectangular spaces . Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard , interspersed with aluminum rails , is seen as the ceiling from below . This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling , since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard , rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it . Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling , the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling , the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling . Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls .",
