Georgia is a successful , talented and well-adjusted folk music singer and a happily married mother of two . Sadie is passionate but self-destructive and untalented . While she seeks fame , she destroys herself through drug abuse . Although the movie focuses largely on Sadie , it was apparently titled Georgia because Sadie defines her own identity so much through her older sister . John Doe of the punk band X played a supporting role and performed as a member of Sadie 's band . The music in the film consisted of 13 songs which were recorded live and performed by the actors . These included covers of songs by Lou Reed , Elvis Costello and , most famously , Van Morrison : in the talked-about centrepiece of the film , Sadie drunkenly performs a raw , gruelling 8\u00bd-minute version of Morrison 's Take Me Back in a ragged Janis Joplin-style gut howl at an AIDS benefit concert . The film was a very personal project for Jennifer Jason Leigh : it was written by her mother , Barbara Turner , Leigh and Turner co-produced it themselves , and she chose as her co-star her longtime friend Mare Winningham , whom she had known since the age of 13 .
