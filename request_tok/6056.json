Along with traditional Chinese characters , they are one of the two standard character sets of the contemporary Chinese written language . The government of the People 's Republic of China in mainland China has promoted them for use in printing since the 1950s and 1960s to encourage literacy . They are officially used in the People 's Republic of China , Malaysia , and Singapore . Traditional Chinese characters are officially used in Hong Kong , Macau , the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) and occasionally in the Chinese community of Malaysia and Singapore . Other Overseas Chinese communities generally tend to use traditional characters . [ citation needed ] Simplified Chinese characters may be referred to by their official name above or colloquially ( \u7b80\u4f53\u5b57 ; ji\u01cent\u01d0z\u00ec ) . The latter refers to simplifications of character structure or body , character forms that have existed for thousands of years alongside regular , more complicated forms . On the other hand , the official name refers to the modern systematically simplified character set , which ( as stated by then-Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952 ) includes not only structural simplification but also substantial reduction in the total number of standardized Chinese characters . Simplified character forms were created by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of Chinese characters . Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms . Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules , for example , by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component .",

It is often used to teach Standard Mandarin Chinese , which is normally written using Chinese characters . The system includes four diacritics denoting tones . Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters . The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists , including Zhou Youguang , based on earlier forms of romanizations of Chinese . It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times . The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982 , and was followed by the United Nations in 1986 . The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009 , where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes . But some cities , businesses , and organizations , notably in the south of Taiwan , did not accept this , as it suggested that Taiwan is more closely tied to the PRC , so it remains one of several rival romanization systems in use . The word H\u00e0ny\u01d4 ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u8bed ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u8a9e ) means 'the spoken language of the Han people ' , while P\u012bny\u012bn ( \u62fc\u97f3 ) literally means 'spelled sounds ' .",

The city then flourished , becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai . After the war , with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949 , trade was limited to other socialist countries , and the city 's global influence declined .
