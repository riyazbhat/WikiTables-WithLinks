The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the other EC Comics of the time ( The Haunt of Fear , The Vault of Horror , Crime SuspenStories , Shock SuspenStories , and Two-Fisted Tales ) . The show was produced by HBO . Because it was aired on HBO , a premium cable television channel , it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices . As a result , HBO allowed the series to include content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time , such as graphic violence , profanity , sexual activity , and nudity . The series is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable . While the series began production in the United States , in the final season filming moved to Britain , resulting in episodes which revolved around British characters .",

  "/wiki/Cupid": "In classical mythology , Cupid ( Latin Cup\u012bd\u014d [ k\u028a\u02c8pi\u02d0do\u02d0 ] , meaning desire ) is the god of desire , erotic love , attraction and affection . He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the god of Mars . He is also known in Latin as Amor ( Love ) . His Greek counterpart is Eros . Although Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in Classical Greek art , during the Hellenistic period , he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy . During this time , his iconography acquired the bow and arrow that represent his source of power : a person , or even a deity , who is shot by Cupid 's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire . In myths , Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion . He is a main character only in the tale of Cupid and Psyche , when wounded by his own weapons , he experiences the ordeal of love . Although other extended stories are not told about him , his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios , such as Love conquers all and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid . In art , Cupid often appears in multiples as the Amores , or amorini in the later terminology of art history , the equivalent of the Greek erotes . Cupids are a frequent motif of both Roman art and later Western art of the classical tradition . In the 15th century , the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the putto .",

Throughout its six-year run , the show received contributions from various producers , writers , and directors , principally Michael Patrick King . Set and filmed in New York City and based on Candace Bushnell 's 1997 book of the same name , the show follows the lives of a group of four women - three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties - who , despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) and co-starring Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life - from sex to relationships - through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping to increase HBO 's popularity as a network . The series has won several accolades , including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations . The series placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly 's New TV Classics list , and has been listed as one of the best television series of all time by Time in 2007 and TV Guide in 2013 .
