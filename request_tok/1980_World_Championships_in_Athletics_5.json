She won the West German title in the 3000 m with a run of 9:02 minutes . This gained her selection for the 1980 World Championships in Athletics - a two-event competition created by the International Amateur Athletics Federation in response to the lack of the women 's 400 metres hurdles and 3000 m run at the 1980 Summer Olympics . Friedmann defeated all-comers at the competition and became the first ever women 's 3000 m world champion with a personal best run of 8:48.05 minutes ( also a West German record ) .

  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957",
