  "/wiki/NBA_territorial_pick": "A territorial pick was a type of special draft choice used in the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) draft in 1949 and in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) draft after the 1950 season , the year in which the BAA was renamed the NBA . In the draft , NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players . Territorial picks were eliminated when the draft system was revamped in 1966 . In the first 20 years of the BAA/NBA , the league was still trying to gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams ' home markets . To achieve this , the league introduced the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support . Before the draft , a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena . Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft , these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft ; therefore , the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick . Of the 23 territorial picks , 12 players have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame . Tom Heinsohn , Wilt Chamberlain , Oscar Robertson and Jerry Lucas are the only four territorial picks who won the Rookie of the Year Award . Chamberlain also won the Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season . He went on to win the Most Valuable Player Award three more times in his career . Oscar Robertson is the only other territorial pick who has won the Most Valuable Player Award ; he won it in the 1963-64 season",
