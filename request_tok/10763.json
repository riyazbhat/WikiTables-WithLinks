  "/wiki/Great_Yarmouth": "Great Yarmouth , often called Yarmouth , is a seaside town in Norfolk , England , straddling the mouth of the River Yare , some 20 miles ( 30 km ) east of Norwich . A population of 38,693 in the 2011 Census made it Norfolk 's third most populous place . Its fishing industry , mainly for herring , fell steeply after the mid-20th century and has all but vanished . North Sea oil from the 1960s brought an oil-rig supply industry that now services offshore natural gas rigs . More recently , offshore wind power and other renewable energy have created further support services . Yarmouth has been a seaside resort since 1760 and a gateway from the Norfolk Broads to the North Sea . As a tourist centre , it was boosted when a railway opened in 1844 gave visitors easier , cheaper access and triggered an influx of settlers . Wellington Pier opened in 1854 and Britannia Pier in 1858 . Through the 20th century , Yarmouth was a booming resort , with a promenade , pubs , trams , fish-and-chip shops and theatres , as well as the Pleasure Beach , the Sea Life Centre , the Hippodrome Circus and the Time and Tide Museum , and a surviving Victorian seaside Winter Garden in cast iron and glass .",

  "/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England": "Edward IV ( 28 April 1442 - 9 April 1483 ) was King of England from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470 , and again from 11 April 1471 until his death . His father , Richard of York , leader of the Yorkist faction , was a lineal descendant of Edward III and until 1453 , heir presumptive to Henry VI , from the ruling Lancastrians . Less than a year old when he came to the throne in September 1422 , Henry 's minority was marked by political infighting within the Regency council . After 1437 , he ruled in his own right but his weak and indecisive personality did little to mitigate factional conflict . Shortly after the birth of his son Edward of Westminster in 1453 , Henry suffered a complete mental breakdown and the government descended into chaos . Conflict between Yorkists and Lancastrians led to civil war in 1455 . This continued intermittently until 1485 and is collectively known as The Wars of the Roses . After Richard was executed in December 1460 , Edward became head of the family ; with the support of the Earl of Warwick , or 'The Kingmaker ' , he deposed Henry and was crowned king in June 1461 . Divisions developed after Edward 's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 ; Warwick switched sides in 1470 and restored Henry to the throne . Edward fled to Flanders , but returned to England in March 1471 , winning victories at Barnet in April and Tewkesbury in May . Warwick , Henry 's heir Edward of Westminster and other senior Lancastrians were killed , while Henry died in the Tower of London a few days later . England remained relatively peaceful until Edward 's death in 1483 .",

The only child of Henry V , he succeeded to the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father 's death , and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather Charles VI shortly afterwards . Henry inherited the long-running Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) , in which his uncle Charles VII contested his claim to the French throne . He is the only English monarch to also have been crowned King of France ( as Henry II , in 1431 ) . His early reign , when several people were ruling for him , saw the pinnacle of English power in France , but subsequent military , diplomatic , and economic problems had seriously endangered the English cause by the time Henry was declared fit to rule in 1437 . He found his realm in a difficult position , faced with setbacks in France and divisions among the nobility at home . Unlike his father , Henry is described as timid , shy , passive , well-intentioned , and averse to warfare and violence ; he was also at times mentally unstable . His ineffective reign saw the gradual loss of the English lands in France . Partially in the hope of achieving peace , in 1445 Henry married Charles VII 's niece , the ambitious and strong-willed Margaret of Anjou . The peace policy failed , leading to the murder of one of Henry 's key advisers , William de la Pole , and the war recommenced , with France taking the upper hand ; by 1453 , Calais was Henry 's only remaining territory on the continent . As the situation in France worsened , there was a related increase in political instability in England . With Henry effectively unfit to rule , power was exercised by quarrelsome nobles , while factions and favourites encouraged the rise of disorder in the country .",

His defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth Field , the last decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses , marked the end of the Middle Ages in England . He is the protagonist of Richard III , one of William Shakespeare 's history plays . When his brother Edward IV died in April 1483 , Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward 's eldest son and successor , the 12-year-old Edward V. Arrangements were made for Edward 's coronation on 22 June 1483 . Before the king could be crowned , the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid . Now officially illegitimate , their children were barred from inheriting the throne . On 25 June , an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard as the rightful king . He was crowned on 6 July 1483 . The young princes , Edward and his younger brother Richard , Duke of York , were not seen in public after August and accusations circulated that they had been murdered on Richard 's orders . There were two major rebellions against Richard during his reign . In October 1483 , an unsuccessful revolt was led by staunch allies of Edward IV and Richard 's former ally , Henry Stafford , 2nd Duke of Buckingham .",

He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle . He cemented his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York , daughter of Richard 's brother Edward IV . Henry was successful in restoring the power and stability of the English monarchy after the civil war . Henry is credited with a number of administrative , economic and diplomatic initiatives . His supportive policy toward England 's wool industry and his standoff with the Low Countries had long-lasting benefit to the whole English economy . He paid very close attention to detail , and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising new revenues .

  "/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England": "Edward VI ( 12 October 1537 - 6 July 1553 ) was the King of England and Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death . He was crowned on 20 February at the age of nine . Edward was the son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour , and England 's first monarch to be raised as a Protestant . During his reign , the realm was governed by a regency council because he never reached maturity . The council was first led by his uncle Edward Seymour , 1st Duke of Somerset ( 1547-1549 ) , and then by John Dudley , 1st Earl of Warwick ( 1550-1553 ) , who from 1551 was Duke of Northumberland . Edward 's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion . An expensive war with Scotland , at first successful , ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace . The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward , who took great interest in religious matters . Although his father , Henry VIII , had severed the link between the Church and Rome , Henry VIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony . It was during Edward 's reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass , and the imposition of compulsory services in English . In February 1553 , at age 15 , Edward fell ill . When his sickness was discovered to be terminal , he and his Council drew up a Devise for the Succession , to prevent the country 's return to Catholicism .",

Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 ( as James I ) , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War .",

  "/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas": "The overseas expansion under the Crown of Castile was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadors . The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the Spanish Empire , with the exception of Brazil , Canada , the north-eastern United States and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean . The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region . The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions . Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries , the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands , half of South America , most of Central America and much of North America ( including present day Mexico , Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States ) . It is estimated that during the colonial period ( 1492-1832 ) , a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era ( 1850-1950 ) ; the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century , and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty . In contrast , the indigenous population plummeted by an estimated 80 % in the first century and a half following Columbus 's voyages , primarily through the spread of Afro-Eurasian diseases . This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of genocide in the modern era , although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease , which is considered a byproduct of the Columbian exchange . Racial mixing was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas , and ultimately led to the Latin American identity , which combines African , Hispanic , and Native American cultures . Spain enjoyed a cultural golden age in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars . In the early 19th century , the Spanish American wars of independence resulted in the secession and subsequent balkanization of most Spanish territories in the Americas , except for Cuba and Puerto Rico , which were finally given up in 1898 , following the Spanish-American War , together with Guam and the Philippines in the Pacific . Spain 's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas .",
