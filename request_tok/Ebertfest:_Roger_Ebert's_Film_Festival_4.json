  "/wiki/Days_of_Heaven": "Days of Heaven is a 1978 American romantic period drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick and starring Richard Gere , Brooke Adams , Sam Shepard , and Linda Manz . Set in 1916 , it tells the story of Bill and Abby , lovers who travel to the Texas Panhandle to harvest crops for a wealthy farmer . Bill encourages Abby to claim the fortune of the dying farmer by tricking him into a false marriage . Days of Heaven was Malick 's second feature film , after Badlands ( 1973 ) , and was produced on a budget of $ 3 million . Production was particularly troublesome , with a tight shooting schedule in Canada in 1976 and significant budget constraints . Additionally , editing took Malick a lengthy two years , due to difficulty with achieving a general flow and assembly of the scenes . This was eventually solved with an added , improvised narration by Linda Manz . The film was scored by Ennio Morricone and photographed by N\u00e9stor Almendros and Haskell Wexler . Days of Heaven received positive reviews on its original theatrical release ; its photography was widely praised , although a small number of critics considered only this aspect to be worthy of high praise . It was not a significant commercial success , but did win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography along with three nominations for the score , costume design and sound . Malick also won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival . Days of Heaven has since become one of the most acclaimed films of its decade , noted particularly for its cinematography",

It premiered in January at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was later a personal selection of Roger Ebert , shown at his 15th annual film festival in Champaign , Illinois . The film was a 2012 official selection of the PollyGrind Film Festival , but at the time filmmakers were still working on some legal issues and asked that it not be screened . The film drew attention due to the fact that Moore had shot most of it on location at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland without permission from The Walt Disney Company , owner and operator of both parks . Due to Disney 's reputation of being protective of its intellectual property , the cast and crew used guerrilla filmmaking techniques to avoid attracting attention , such as keeping their scripts on their iPhones and shooting on handheld video cameras similar to those used by park visitors . After principal photography was complete , Moore was so determined to keep the project a secret from Disney that he edited it in South Korea . Sundance similarly declined to discuss the film in detail before it was shown . It was called the ultimate guerrilla film .
