  "/wiki/Palladium": "Palladium is a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46 . It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston . He named it after the asteroid Pallas , which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena , acquired by her when she slew Pallas . Palladium , platinum , rhodium , ruthenium , iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals ( PGMs ) . They have similar chemical properties , but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them . More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters , which convert as much as 90 % of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust ( hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide , and nitrogen dioxide ) into less noxious substances ( nitrogen , carbon dioxide and water vapor ) . Palladium is also used in electronics , dentistry , medicine , hydrogen purification , chemical applications , groundwater treatment , and jewelry . Palladium is a key component of fuel cells , which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity , heat , and water . Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare . The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa , the Stillwater Complex in Montana , United States ; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario , Canada , and the Norilsk Complex in Russia . Recycling is also a source , mostly from scrapped catalytic converters . The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest",
