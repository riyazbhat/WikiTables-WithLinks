They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season .

But the Yankees closed out the series in New York , beating the Mariners four games to one .
