  "/wiki/Port_Augusta_Renewable_Energy_Park": "The Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park is proposed to be a large wind farm and solar farm south of Port Augusta in South Australia , Australia . The solar farm is planned to be at the northern end of the site , west of the Augusta Highway and immediately south of Sundrop Farms . The wind turbines will be on both sides of the Augusta Highway , extending south as far as the road to Horrocks Pass . Construction is intended to start mid-2020 and take about 18 months to complete . The project has been developed by DP Energy , but prior to construction , Spanish company Iberdrola committed to investing A $ 500 million and will eventually own stage 1 after DP Energy manages its construction . Stage 1 is planned to comprise 210MW of wind generation and 110MW of solar generation . Stage 2 remains owned by DP Energy and is proposed to include more solar photovoltaic generation and a grid connected battery . The developer claims that the combination of wind , solar , battery and synchronous condensers combine to create a renewable energy power station . The wind turbines were originally approved to have a maximum height ( to the tip of the blades ) of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) but in June 2019 , this approval was increased to 185 metres ( 607 ft ) . The revised plan raises the hub height to 107.5 metres ( 353 ft ) , nominal generating capacity of each turbine to 4.5MW , and reduces the number of turbines from 59 to 50 . The wind turbines will be supplied by Vestas and solar components supplied by Downer Group .",
