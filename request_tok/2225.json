  "/wiki/New_York_State_Route_2": "New York State Route 2 ( NY 2 ) is a state highway in the Capital District of New York in the United States . It extends for 30.89 miles ( 49.71 km ) from an interchange with Interstate 87 ( I-87 ) and NY 7 in the town of Colonie to the Massachusetts state line in Petersburgh , where it continues to Boston as Massachusetts Route 2 . The route passes through the cities of Watervliet and Troy , where it connects to NY 32 and U.S. Route 4 , respectively . In Grafton , located midway between Troy and Massachusetts , NY 2 serves Grafton Lakes State Park . Most of the route was originally designated as part of an unsigned legislative route in the 1910s . In 1924 , the portion of modern NY 2 between the hamlet of Latham and downtown Troy became part of NY 9 . The rest of the highway was designated as NY 96 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 96 was renumbered to NY 2 in 1942 . From 1942 to 1970 , NY 2 continued south along the Hudson River from Troy to Albany . It was extended to Latham in 1985 , replacing a section of NY 7 that had been realigned onto a new parallel freeway to the north .",

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

He is the only sitting member of the United States House of Representatives to be elected to the presidency . Garfield entered politics as a Republican in 1857 . He served as a member of the Ohio State Senate from 1859 to 1861 . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . At the 1880 Republican National Convention , delegates chose Garfield - who had not sought the White House - as a compromise presidential candidate on the 36th ballot . In the 1880 presidential election , Garfield conducted a low-key front porch campaign and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . Garfield 's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments , purging corruption in the Post Office , and appointing a U.S. Supreme Court justice . He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York , starting a fracas that ended with Robertson 's confirmation and Conkling 's resignation from the Senate .",

  "/wiki/Herman_Melville": "Herman Melville ( born Melvill ; [ a ] August 1 , 1819 - September 28 , 1891 ) was an American novelist , short story writer and poet of the American Renaissance period . Among his best-known works are his magnum opus , Moby-Dick ( 1851 ) , and Typee ( 1846 ) , a romantic account of his experiences of Polynesian life . Melville was born in New York City , the third child of a merchant . Typee , his first book , was followed by a sequel , Omoo ( 1847 ) . Both were successful and they gave him the financial basis to marry Elizabeth Lizzie Shaw , a daughter of a prominent Boston family . His first novel not based on his own experiences , Mardi ( 1849 ) , was not well received . His next fictional work , Redburn ( 1849 ) , and his non-fiction White-Jacket ( 1850 ) were given better reviews but did not provide financial security . Moby-Dick ( 1851 ) , although now considered one of the great American novels , was initially not well received by contemporary critics . His psychological novel , Pierre : or , The Ambiguities ( 1852 ) was also scorned by reviewers . From 1853 to 1856 , Melville published short fiction in magazines , which was collected in 1856 as The Piazza Tales . In 1857 , he traveled to England and then toured the Near East , and that same year published his last work of prose , The Confidence-Man ( 1857 ) .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bennington": "The Battle of Bennington was a battle of the American Revolutionary War , part of the Saratoga campaign , that took place on August 16 , 1777 , in Walloomsac , New York , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from its namesake Bennington , Vermont . A rebel force of 2,000 men , primarily New Hampshire and Massachusetts militiamen , led by General John Stark , and reinforced by Vermont militiamen led by Colonel Seth Warner and members of the Green Mountain Boys , decisively defeated a detachment of General John Burgoyne 's army led by Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum , and supported by additional men under Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann . Baum 's detachment was a mixed force of 700 , composed primarily of Hessians but also including smaller numbers of dismounted Brunswick dragoons , Canadians , Loyalists and Indians . He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses , draft animals , provisions , and other supplies . Believing the town to be only lightly defended , Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there . After a rain-caused standoff , Stark 's men enveloped Baum 's position , taking many prisoners , and killing Baum . Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up , and the battle restarted , with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann 's reinforcements with heavy casualties . The battle was a major strategic success for the American cause and is considered part of the turning point of the Revolutionary War ; it reduced Burgoyne 's army in size by almost 1,000 men , led his Native-American support to largely abandon him , and deprived him of much-needed supplies , such as mounts for his cavalry regiments , draft animals and provisions , all factors that contributed to Burgoyne 's eventual defeat at Saratoga . The victory galvanized colonial support for the independence movement , and played a key role in bringing France into the war on the rebel side .
