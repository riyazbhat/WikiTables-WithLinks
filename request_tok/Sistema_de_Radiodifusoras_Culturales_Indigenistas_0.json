Varieties of Nahuatl are spoken by about 1.7 million Nahua peoples , most of whom live in central Mexico . Nahuatl has been spoken in central Mexico since at least the seventh century CE . It was the language of the Aztecs , who dominated what is now central Mexico during the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerican history . During the centuries preceding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , the Aztecs had expanded to incorporate a large part of central Mexico , and their influence caused the variety of Nahuatl spoken by the residents of Tenochtitlan to become a prestige language in Mesoamerica . At the conquest , with the introduction of the Latin alphabet , Nahuatl also became a literary language , and many chronicles , grammars , works of poetry , administrative documents and codices were written in it during the 16th and 17th centuries . This early literary language based on the Tenochtitlan variety has been labeled Classical Nahuatl , and is among the most studied and best-documented languages of America . Today , Nahuan languages are spoken in scattered communities , mostly in rural areas throughout central Mexico and along the coastline . There are considerable differences among varieties , and some are not mutually intelligible . Huasteca Nahuatl , with over one million speakers , is the most-spoken variety . All varieties have been subject to varying degrees of influence from Spanish . No modern Nahuan languages are identical to Classical Nahuatl , but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to it than those on the periphery",

With an estimated population of around 17.2 million , it is the most populous country in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n , also known as Guatemala City . The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved by 1841 . From the mid- to late-19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , the authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship . From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability",
