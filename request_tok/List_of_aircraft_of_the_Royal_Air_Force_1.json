  "/wiki/Impressment": "Impressment , colloquially the press or the press gang , is the taking of men into a military or naval force by compulsion , with or without notice . Navies of several nations used forced recruitment by various means . The large size of the British Royal Navy in the Age of Sail meant impressment was most commonly associated with Great Britain and Ireland . It was used by the Royal Navy in wartime , beginning in 1664 and during the 18th and early 19th centuries as a means of crewing warships , although legal sanction for the practice can be traced back to the time of Edward I of England . The Royal Navy impressed many merchant sailors , as well as some sailors from other , mostly European , nations . People liable to impressment were eligible men of seafaring habits between the ages of 18 and 55 years . Non-seamen were impressed as well , though rarely . Impressment was strongly criticized by those who believed it to be contrary to the British constitution ; unlike many of its continental rivals at the time , British subjects were not subject to conscription for military service , with the exception of a brief experiment with army impressment from 1778 to 1780 . Though the public opposed conscription in general , impressment was repeatedly upheld by the courts , as it was deemed vital to the strength of the navy and , by extension , to the survival of the British influence and realm . Impressment was essentially a Royal Navy practice , reflecting the size of the British fleet and its substantial manpower demands . While other European navies applied forced recruitment in times of war , this was generally done as an extension of the practice of formal conscription applied by most European armies from the Napoleonic Wars on . The U.S. Continental Navy also applied a form of impressment during the American War of Independence .",
