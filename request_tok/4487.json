  "/wiki/Ian_Paisley": "Ian Richard Kyle Paisley , Baron Bannside PC ( 6 April 1926 - 12 September 2014 ) , was a loyalist politician and Protestant religious leader from Northern Ireland . He became a Protestant evangelical minister in 1946 and remained one for the rest of his life . In 1951 he co-founded the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and was its leader until 2008 . Paisley became known for his fiery sermons and regularly preached and protested against Roman Catholicism , ecumenism and homosexuality . He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as Paisleyites . Paisley became involved in Ulster unionist/loyalist politics in the late 1950s . In the mid-late 1960s , he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland . This contributed to the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s , a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next thirty years . In 1970 he became Member of Parliament for North Antrim and the following year he founded the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) , which he would lead for almost forty years . In 1979 he became a Member of the European Parliament . Throughout the Troubles , Paisley was seen as a firebrand and the face of hardline unionism . He opposed all attempts to resolve the conflict through power-sharing between unionists and Irish nationalists/republicans , and all attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern affairs .",
  "/wiki/Protestant_Unionist_Party": "The Protestant Unionist Party ( PUP ) was a unionist political party operating in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 1971 . It was the forerunner of the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) and emerged from the Ulster Protestant Action ( UPA ) movement . It was founded an led by Ian Paisley , who also founded and led the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster . The UPA had two councillors elected to Belfast Corporation . In 1967 , both were re-elected as PUP candidates . The PUP stood six candidates against the ruling Ulster Unionist Party of the Northern Ireland parliament in the January 1969 general election . They polled over 20,000 votes , but gained no seats . When Terence O'Neill ( the then Northern Irish Prime Minister ) stood down from Stormont in 1970 along with one of his colleagues , the PUP nominated candidates for the two vacant seats . Both were successful . Ian Paisley and fellow Free Presbyterian minister , the Rev . William Beattie , PUP leader and deputy respectively , were elected . In that year 's Westminster general election , Paisley was elected to represent Antrim North in the British House of Commons .",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party": "The Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland favouring British identity . It was founded in 1971 during the Troubles by Ian Paisley , who led the party for the next 37 years . Now led by Arlene Foster , it is equal with Sinn F\u00e9in in having the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly , and it is the fifth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom . The DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster , the church Paisley founded . During the Troubles , the DUP were opposed to power-sharing with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict , and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs . It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 , the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 , and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 . In 2006 , the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and agreed to share power with the republican party Sinn Fein who agreed to support the Police Service , courts , and rule of law . The party has been linked to various loyalist paramilitary groups , namely Ulster Resistance ( URM ) and Third Force . The URM was formed on 10 November 1986 by DUP politicians Paisley , Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster , with the stated aim to take direct action as and when required to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism . Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined . The following year , the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland , which were shared out between the URM , the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) and the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) . In 1989 , URM members attempted to trade Shorts ' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime .",

They support the \u00c9ire Nua policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments . RSF holds that the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 continues to exist , and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its de jure government . The organisation views itself as representing true or traditional Irish republicanism , while in the mainstream media the organisation is portrayed as a political expression of dissident republicanism .

From 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2011 , he was an abstentionist Member of Parliament ( MP ) of the British Parliament for the Belfast West constituency . In 1984 , Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by several gunmen from the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) , including John Gregg . From the late 1980s onwards , Adams was an important figure in the Northern Ireland peace process , initially following contact by the then-Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SDLP ) leader John Hume and then subsequently with the Irish and British governments . Under Adams , Sinn F\u00e9in changed its traditional policy of abstentionism towards the Oireachtas , the parliament of the Republic of Ireland , in 1986 and later took seats in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly .

In 2014 , he was held for four days by the Police Service of Northern Ireland for questioning in connection with the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972 .

The Act granted limited self-government to Ireland , within the United Kingdom . However , implementation of Home Rule was suspended by the outbreak of the First World War . Redmond called on the National Volunteers to join Irish regiments of the New British Army and support the British and Allied war effort to restore the freedom of small nations on the European continent , thereby to also ensure the implementation of Home Rule after a war that was expected to be of short duration . However , after the Easter Rising of 1916 , Irish public opinion shifted in favour of militant republicanism and full Irish independence , so that his party lost its dominance in Irish politics .

Kilfedder held his seat in the UK Parliament at the 1983 general election with a large majority , but fared less well when he stood in the 1984 European election , taking only 2.9 % of the first preference votes . A unionist pact enabled Kilfedder to easily win a by-election in 1986 , when he joined the other unionist MPs in resigning in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement . A challenge from Bob McCartney , standing as a Real Unionist , led to a close election in 1987 , but Kilfedder held on , and beat a Conservative Party opponent in 1992 .
