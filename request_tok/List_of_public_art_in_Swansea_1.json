  "/wiki/Dylan_Thomas": "Dylan Marlais Thomas ( 27 October 1914 - 9 November 1953 ) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems Do not go gentle into that good night and And death shall have no dominion ; the 'play for voices ' Under Milk Wood ; and stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child 's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog . He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City . By then he had acquired a reputation , which he had encouraged , as a roistering , drunken and doomed poet . Thomas was born in Swansea , Wales , in 1914 . An undistinguished pupil , he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time . Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager , and the publication in 1934 of Light breaks where no sun shines caught the attention of the literary world . While living in London , Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara , whom he married in 1937 . In 1938 , they moved to the Welsh fishing village of Laugharne where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children . Thomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime , though he found earning a living as a writer difficult . He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts . His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public 's attention , and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene . Thomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s .",

  "/wiki/St._David's_Shopping_Centre_(Swansea)": "St. David 's Shopping Centre is a shopping complex in Swansea , south Wales . The complex is located adjacent to the Quadrant Shopping Centre and opposite St Mary 's Church . Completed in 1982 , the complex has thus far been fairly unsuccessful , in terms of filling its outlet spaces and retaining customers . The complex consists of several buildings , clad in red brick , which comprise a number of shop units at ground level which are directly accessible from the street . There was a market hall on the first floor which is now closed . During the 1980s the upper floor area was open and contained many small stalls run by local traders . To the south of the complex lies the St. David 's car park . An octagonal building located in the north west corner of the complex was occupied by S4C as a studio for a number of years . The studio was used for broadcasting the Heno programme . The building was originally built to be occupied by a restaurant but it was never taken up for this purpose . For most of the building 's lifetime so far , it has been unoccupied . Also , there have been many plans for the old shopping centre including demolition and expansion of the adjacent Quadrant shopping centre ; or total demolition and to be replaced by a multi-storey car park .",
