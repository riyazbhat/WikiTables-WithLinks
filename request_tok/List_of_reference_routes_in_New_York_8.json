Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area ( also known as Greater Binghamton , or historically the Triple Cities ) , home to a quarter million people . The population of the city itself , according to the 2010 census , is 47,376 . From the days of the railroad , Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center , and has been known at different times for the production of cigars , shoes , and computers . IBM was founded nearby , and the flight simulator was invented in the city , leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented firms . This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the Valley of Opportunity . However , following cuts made by defense firms after the end of the Cold War , the region has lost a significant portion of its manufacturing industry . Today , while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms , Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- and education-focused city , with the presence of Binghamton University acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization",

At Watertown , US 11 turns northeastward to head across New York 's North Country while I-81 continues on a generally northward track to the Canadian border . From there , the road continues into the province of Ontario as Highway 137 , a short route leading north to the nearby Highway 401 . The portion of I-81 in New York was originally developed as the Penn-Can Highway , one of four expressways proposed by the state in 1953 .

NY 97 intersects NY 52 in Narrowsburg and indirectly connects to three Pennsylvania state highways due to its proximity to the state line . The New York State Legislature created Route 3-a , an unsigned legislative route extending from Port Jervis to Hancock along the Delaware River , in 1911 . Initially , it was a route in name only as the portion north of Port Jervis had yet to be built .

At 444 miles ( 715 km ) long , it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States that drains into the Chesapeake Bay . With its watershed , it is the 16th-largest river in the United States , and the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic . The Susquehanna River forms from two main branches : the North Branch , which rises in Cooperstown , New York , and is regarded by federal mapmakers as the main branch or headwaters , and the West Branch , which rises in western Pennsylvania and joins the main branch near Northumberland in central Pennsylvania . The river drains 27,500 square miles ( 71,000 km2 ) , including nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania . The drainage basin ( watershed ) includes portions of the Allegheny Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains , cutting through a succession of water gaps in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland in the lateral near-parallel array of mountain ridges . The river empties into the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at Perryville and Havre de Grace , Maryland , providing half of the Bay 's freshwater inflow . The Chesapeake Bay is the ria of the Susquehanna",
