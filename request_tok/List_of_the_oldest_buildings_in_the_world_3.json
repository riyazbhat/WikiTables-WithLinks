It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto )",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic",

  "/wiki/Greensted_Church": "Greensted Church , in the small village of Greensted , near Chipping Ongar in Essex , England , is the oldest wooden church in the world , and probably the oldest wooden building in Europe still standing , albeit only in part , since few sections of its original wooden structure remain . The oak walls are often classified as remnants of a palisade church or a kind of early stave church , dated either to the mid-9th or mid-11th century . The Grade I listed building lies about a mile west of Chipping Ongar town centre . Its full title is The Church of St Andrew , Greensted-juxta-Ongar . It is , however , commonly known simply as Greensted Church . Greensted is still a functioning church and holds services every week . The volume of tourist visits is light , but steady . The church was featured on a British postage stamp issued in 1972",
  "/wiki/Kirkjub\u00f8argar\u00f0ur": "Kirkjub\u00f8argar\u00f0ur ( Faroese for Yard of Kirkjub\u00f8ur , also known as King 's Farm ) is one of the oldest still inhabited wooden houses in the world , if not the oldest . The farm itself has always been the largest in the Faroe Islands . The old farmhouse of Kirkjub\u00f8ur dates back to the 11th century . It was the episcopal residence and seminary of the Diocese of the Faroe Islands , from about 1100 . The legend says that the wood for the block houses came as driftwood from Norway and was accurately bundled and numbered , just for being set up . Note that there is no forest in the Faroes , with the exception of a wood in northern T\u00f3rshavn , and wood is a very valuable material . Many such wood legends are thus to be found in Faroese history . The oldest part is a so-called roykstova ( reek parlour , or smoke room ) . Perhaps it was moved one day , because it does not fit to its foundation . Another ancient room is the loftstovan ( loft room ) . It is supposed that Bishop Erlendur wrote the 'Sheep Letter ' here in 1298 . This is the earliest document of the Faroes we know today",
  "/wiki/Faroe_Islands": "The Faroe Islands ( /\u02c8f\u025b\u0259ro\u028a/ ; Faroese : F\u00f8royar , pronounced [ \u02c8f\u0153\u0279ja\u0279 ] ; Danish : F\u00e6r\u00f8erne , pronounced [ \u02c8f\u00e6\u0250\u032f\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0\u0250n\u0259 ] ) , or the Faeroe Islands , is a North Atlantic archipelago located 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) north-northwest of Scotland , and about halfway between Norway and Iceland . It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark . The islands have a total area of about 1,400 square kilometres ( 540 sq mi ) with a population of 51,783 as of June 2019 [ update ] . The terrain is rugged ; the climate is subpolar oceanic climate ( Cfc ) - windy , wet , cloudy , and cool . Temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream . As a result of the moderation and the northerly latitude , summers normally hover around 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) . Average temperatures are 5 \u00b0C ( 41 \u00b0F ) in winter . The northerly latitude location also results in perpetual civil twilight during summer nights and very short winter days . Between 1035 and 1814 the Faroes were part of the Kingdom of Norway , which was in a personal union with Denmark from 1450 . In 1814 the Treaty of Kiel transferred Norway to the king of Sweden , on the winning side of the Napoleonic wars , whereas the king of Denmark , on the losing side , retained the Faroes , along with the two other historical Norwegian island possessions in the North Atlantic : Greenland and Iceland . The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948 . The Faroese control most of their domestic affairs",

  "/wiki/Bihar": "Bihar ( /b\u026a\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0r/ ; Hindi pronunciation : [ b\u026a\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0r ] ( listen ) ) is a state in eastern India . It is the third-largest state by population and twelfth-largest by territory , with an area of 94,163 km2 ( 36,357 sq mi ) . It is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west , Nepal to the north , the northern part of West Bengal to the east , and with Jharkhand to the south . The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges , which flows from west to east . Three main cultural regions converge in the state : Magadh , Mithila , and Bhojpur . On 15 November 2000 , southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand . Only 11.3 % of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas , which is the lowest in India after Himachal Pradesh . Additionally , almost 58 % of Biharis are below the age of 25 , giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state . In ancient and classical India , the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power , learning , and culture . From Magadha arose India 's first empire , the Maurya empire , as well as one of the world 's most widely adhered-to religions : Buddhism . Magadha empires , notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties , unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule . Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom",
  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief",
  "/wiki/Hindu_temple": "A Hindu temple is a symbolic house , seat and body of divinity . It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together , using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism . The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions , deploying circles and squares . It also represents recursion and equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers , and by specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron . A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmos - presenting the good , the evil and the human , as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life - symbolically presenting dharma , kama , artha , moksa , and karma . The spiritual principles symbolically represented in Hindu temples are given in the ancient Sanskrit texts of India ( for example , Vedas and Upanishads ) , while their structural rules are described in various ancient Sanskrit treatises on architecture ( Brhat Samhita , Vastu Sastras ) . The layout , the motifs , the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals , geometric symbolisms , and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism . A Hindu temple is a spiritual destination for many Hindus , as well as landmarks around which ancient arts , community celebrations and economy have flourished . Hindu temples come in many styles , are situated in diverse locations , deploy different construction methods and are adapted to different deities and regional beliefs , yet almost all of them share certain core ideas , symbolism and themes . They are found in South Asia particularly India and Nepal , Pakistan , in southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka , Cambodia , Vietnam , and islands of Indonesia and Malaysia , and countries such as Canada , the Caribbean , Fiji , France , Guyana , Kenya , Mauritius , the Netherlands , South Africa , Suriname , Tanzania , Trinidad and Tobago , Uganda , the United Kingdom , the United States , and countries with a significant Hindu community . The current state and outer appearance of Hindu temples reflect arts , materials and designs as they evolved over two millennia ; they also reflect the effect of conflicts between Hinduism and Islam since the 12th century . The Swaminarayanan Akshardham in Robbinsville , New Jersey , United States , between the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas , was inaugurated in 2014 as one of the world 's largest Hindu temples"
