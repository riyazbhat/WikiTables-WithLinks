Athletics is mostly an individual sport , with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes ' performances for a team score , such as cross country . Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC .

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors",

The 1983 America 's Cup was the occasion of the first winning challenge to the New York Yacht Club , which had successfully defended the cup over a period of 132 years . An Australian syndicate representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club fielded the Australia II , skippered by John Bertrand against defender Liberty , skippered by Dennis Conner , won the match races to win the America 's Cup , ending the longest winning streak in sporting history and ending American domination of the racing series . Alan Bond arrived at Newport with Australia II , billed as one of the biggest threats to American dominance of the 12 Metre class . The boat was designed by Ben Lexcen and skippered by John Bertrand . The revolutionary winged keel of the Australian yacht was a subject of controversy from the outset of the challenger series , with the New York Yacht club alleging that the winged keel boat was not a legal 12 Meter , and that the keel design itself was the result of Dutch engineers , and not by Lexcen . This second point would make Australia II illegal under the requirement that the boat be designed and constructed in country as the Deed of Gift that governed the competition stipulated . The boat was ruled a legal 12 Meter , and she was allowed to participate in the regatta . The speed of the new contender , along with the controversy and protests intensified international media attention to the series .
