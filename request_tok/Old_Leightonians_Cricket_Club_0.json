  "/wiki/Batsman": "In cricket , batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs or prevent the loss of one 's wicket . Any player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman , batswoman , or batter , regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise . Batting players have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches , especially in different countries - therefore , as well as having outstanding physical batting skills , top-level batters will have lightning reflexes , excellent decision-making and be good strategists . During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time : the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is denoted the striker , while the other is the non-striker . When a batting player is out , they are replaced by a teammate . This continues until the end of the innings , which is often when 10 of the team members are out , whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat . Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play . The main concerns for the batting players are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible . These objectives generally conflict - to score quickly , risky shots must be played , increasing the chance that the batting player will be dismissed , while the batting player 's safest choice with a careful wicket-guarding stroke may be not to attempt any runs at all . Depending on the situation , batting players may abandon attempts at run-scoring in an effort to preserve their wicket , or may attempt to score runs as quickly as possible with scant concern for the possibility of being dismissed . As with all other cricket statistics , batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a measure of a player 's effectiveness . The main statistic for batting is a player 's batting average .",
  "/wiki/Off_spin": "Off spin is a type of finger spin bowling in cricket . A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner . Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers to spin the ball from a right-handed batsman 's off side to the leg side ( that is , towards the right-handed batsman , or away from a left-handed batsman ) . This contrasts with leg spin , in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action . A left-handed bowler who bowls with the same action as an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler . While the orthodox spinner has the same action as an off-spinner , the ball itself spins in the opposite direction ( akin to a right arm leg spinner ) . Off spin is generally considered less difficult to play than leg spin , as off breaks typically spin less than leg breaks , and do not generally possess the same loopy , potentially deceptive flight . In addition , off spinners tend to have a smaller repertoire of deliveries to choose from . However , the off spinner often bowls faster and more accurately than a leg spinner , and can therefore deceive the batsman with changes in the pace of the ball . Another common weapon of the off spinner is the arm ball , which does not spin but goes straight on with the arm . More skilled offspinners also have the topspinner . Aside from these variations in spin , varying the speed , length and flight of the ball are also important for the off spinner .",
  "/wiki/Leg_spin": "Leg spin is a type of spin bowling in cricket . A leg spinner , also called leggie , bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action , causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch when the ball bounces , that is , away from the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The same kind of trajectory , which spins from right to left on pitching , when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm unorthodox spin bowling . As with all spinners , leg spinners bowl the ball far more slowly ( 70-90 km/h or 45-55 mph ) than fast bowlers . The fastest leg spinners will sometimes top 100 km/h ( 60 mph ) . Leg spinners typically use variations of flight by sometimes looping the ball in the air , allowing any cross-breeze and the aerodynamic effects of the spinning ball to cause the ball to dip and drift before bouncing and spinning ( usually called turning ) sharply . While very difficult to bowl accurately , good leg spin is considered one of the most threatening types of bowling to bat against , since the flight and sharp turn make the ball 's movement extremely hard to read and the turn away from the batsman ( assuming he or she is right-handed ) is more dangerous than the turn into the batsman generated by an off spinner . One famous example of the leg-spin is the Gatting Ball or the Ball of the century .",
  "/wiki/Seam_bowling": "Seam bowling is a bowling technique in cricket whereby the ball is deliberately bowled on to its seam , to cause a random deviation . Practitioners are known as seam bowlers or seamers . Seam bowling is generally classed as a subtype of fast bowling , although the bowling speeds at which seam can be a factor include medium-pace bowling . Although there are specialist seamers that make deliberate use of off cutter and leg cutter at the expense of bowling slower than regular fast bowlers , most bowlers employ the seam to some effect and so the terms seamer and fast bowler are largely synonymous .",
  "/wiki/Slow_left_arm": "Left-arm orthodox spin , also known as slow left-arm orthodox spin bowling , is a type of left-arm finger off spin bowling in the sport of cricket . Left-arm orthodox spin is bowled by a left-arm bowler using the fingers to spin the ball from right to left of the cricket pitch ( from the bowler 's perspective ) . Left arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman , and then turn it away from the batsman ( towards off-stump ) upon landing on the pitch . The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques . The stock delivery of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler is the left-arm orthodox spinner . The major variations of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler are the topspinner ( which turns less and bounces higher in the cricket pitch ) , the arm ball ( which does not turn at all , drifts into a right-handed batsman in the direction of the bowler 's arm movement ; also called a 'floater ' ) and the left-arm spinner 's version of a doosra ( which turns the other way ) .",
  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",
