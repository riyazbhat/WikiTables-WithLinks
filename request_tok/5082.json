  "/wiki/Snowboard": "Snowboards are boards where both feet are secured to the same board , which are wider than skis , with the ability to glide on snow . Snowboards widths are between 6 and 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters . Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user . In monoskiing , the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel ( facing tip of monoski/downhill ) ( parallel to long axis of board ) , whereas in snowboarding , users stand with feet transverse ( more or less ) to the longitude of the board . Users of such equipment may be referred to as snowboarders . Commercial snowboards generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder , who generally rides in an upright position . These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure , entertainment , and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding .",
