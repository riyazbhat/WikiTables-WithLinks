  "/wiki/Darrington,_Washington": "Darrington is a town in Snohomish County , Washington , United States . It is located in a mountain valley within the North Cascades that was formed by the Sauk River and North Fork Stillaguamish River . Darrington is connected to nearby areas by State Route 530 , which runs along the two rivers towards the city of Arlington , located 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the west , and Rockport . It had a population of 1,347 at the 2010 census . The town was founded in 1891 on the site of a Skagit campsite between the two rivers , near the traditional home of the Sauk-Suiattle tribe . Prospectors had arrived in the area during the 1880s while looking for gold and other minerals , but were quickly displaced by the logging industry that would come to dominate Darrington for much of the 20th century . The Northern Pacific Railway built a branch line to the town in 1901 and ushered in several years of growth . During the Great Depression , Darrington hosted a Civilian Conservation Corps camp that improved roads , trails , and firefighting infrastructure in the nearby Mount Baker National Forest . Several waves of Appalachian emigrants arrived in the area from North Carolina , forming a culture that is seen in the town 's annual bluegrass festival and rodeo . Darrington was incorporated as a town on October 15 , 1945 , and continues to operate under a mayor-council government . It has transitioned away from logging and towards tourism due to its proximity to the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest , which includes outdoor activities such as hiking , mountain climbing , and fishing . The Darrington area is 554 feet ( 169 m ) above sea level and receives significantly more precipitation and snowfall than the Puget Sound lowlands .",

The Long Beach Peninsula separates Willapa Bay from the greater expanse of the Pacific Ocean . With over 260 square miles ( 670 km2 ) of water surface Willapa Bay is the second-largest estuary on the United States Pacific coast . Early settlers called the bay Shoalwater Bay and this name is found on old maps and charts of the region . Willapa Bay is fairly shallow : more than half of its surface area lies in the intertidal zone , and half of the volume of water inside it enters and leaves with every tide . The bay is an estuary formed when the Long Beach Peninsula , a long sand spit from the Columbia River to the south , partially enclosed the estuaries of several smaller rivers . It is a ria , which formed after the rise in sea level at the end of the last ice age flooded several small river valleys . The North River , Willapa River , and Naselle River provide most of the freshwater input into the bay . Other rivers that empty into Willapa Bay include the Bone River , Niawiakum River , Palix River , Cedar River and Bear River , among others . The bay is bordered by several smaller towns and unincorporated communities such as Raymond and South Bend , both on the Willapa River ; Oysterville , Nahcotta , Bay Center and Tokeland are on the bay itself . The bay is entirely located within Pacific County , Washington and is home to a local oyster and seafood processing industry : approximately 9 % of all oysters in the U.S. are grown there .
