  "/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)": "Minority Report is a 2002 American cyberpunk crime film directed by Steven Spielberg and loosely based on the 1956 short story The Minority Report by Philip K. Dick . It is set primarily in Washington , D.C. , and Northern Virginia in the year 2054 , where PreCrime , a specialized police department , apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by psychics called precogs . The cast includes Tom Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton , Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer , Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha , and Max von Sydow as Anderton 's superior Lamar Burgess . The film combines elements of tech noir , whodunit , thriller and science fiction genres , as well as a traditional chase film , as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive . Spielberg has characterized the story as fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot . The film 's central theme is the question of free will versus determinism . It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance . Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry , the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless , the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor , and Spielberg 's repeated theme of broken families . Some would consider it a dystopian film , rather than neo-noir . The film was first optioned in 1992 , as a sequel to another Dick adaptation , Total Recall , and started its development in 1997 , after a script by Jon Cohen reached Spielberg and Cruise . Production suffered many delays due to Cruise 's Mission : Impossible 2 and Spielberg 's A.I . running over schedule , eventually starting in March 2001 .",

  "/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events": "A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of thirteen novels written by American author Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket . Although they are classified children 's novels , the books often have a dark , mysterious feeling to them . The books follow the turbulent lives of Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire . After their parents ' death in a fire , the children are placed in the custody of a murderous relative , Count Olaf , who attempts to steal their inheritance and , later , orchestrates numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee . As the plot progresses , the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society known as V.F.D. , with connections to Olaf , their parents , and many other relatives . The series is narrated by Lemony Snicket , who dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest , Beatrice , and often attempts to dissuade the reader from reading the Baudelaires ' story . Characterized by Victorian Gothic tones and absurdist textuality , the books are noted for their dark humor , sarcastic storytelling , and anachronistic elements , as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions . They have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing , with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of transition from the idyllic innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity . Likewise , the final installments of the series are also acknowledged for their escalatingly intricate ethical ambiguity toward philosophical ambivalence , as the nature of some of the Baudelaires ' actions becomes increasingly harder to discern from those of their antagonist counterparts and more characters are revealed to be responsible for permanent wrongdoing , despite their identification with the self-proclaimed good side of the tale . Since the release of the first novel , The Bad Beginning , in September 1999 , the books have gained significant popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide , spawning a film , a video game , assorted merchandise and a television series on Netflix . The main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages .
