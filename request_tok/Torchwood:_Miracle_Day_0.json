  "/wiki/Jack_Harkness": "Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character played by John Barrowman in Doctor Who and its spin-off series , Torchwood .

Subsequent to this , Jack became the central character in the adult-themed Torchwood , which aired from 2006 to 2011 . Barrowman reprised the role for guest appearances in Doctor Who in its third and fourth series , the two-part special The End of Time and returned in the twelfth series episode Fugitive of the Judoon . In contrast to The Doctor , Jack is more of a conventional action hero , as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which The Doctor would view as less than noble . In the programme 's narrative , Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century , who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and his companion Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) . As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the Series 1 finale , The Parting of the Ways , Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th-century Earth . There he becomes a member of Torchwood , a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats . He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor , over which time he becomes Torchwood 's leader . Eventually , he reunites with the Tenth Doctor ( David Tennant ) for several appearances in Doctor Who . Aspects of the character 's backstory - both prior to meeting The Doctor , and during his many decades living on Earth - are gradually revealed over Torchwood ( and to a lesser extent , Doctor Who ) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue . Jack was the first openly non-heterosexual character in the history of televised Doctor Who .",

Myles 's role in Torchwood earned her a Bafta Cymru award for Best Actress in 2007 .

  "/wiki/Gwen_Cooper": "Gwen Cooper is a fictional character portrayed by Welsh actress Eve Myles in the BBC science-fiction television programme Torchwood , a spin-off of the long-running series Doctor Who . The lead female character , Gwen featured in every episode of the show 's 2006-11 run , as well as two 2008 crossover episodes of Doctor Who . Gwen appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks , comic books and radio plays . Within the series narrative , Gwen is a South Wales Police officer who discovers the mysterious Torchwood Institute , into which she is recruited by Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) . Gwen initially operates as a field agent , bringing a humane and rounded approach to the team 's investigations of the extraterrestrial . Gwen 's work begins to take a toll on her personal life in series one ( 2006 ) , but her marriage to Rhys ( Kai Owen ) keeps her grounded , even as her responsibilities increase in series two ( 2008 ) . In Children of Earth ( 2009 ) and Miracle Day ( 2011 ) , after Torchwood is destroyed to conceal a government conspiracy , a much hardened Gwen operates under her own mandate as the world undergoes crises linked with unprecedented alien threats . Gwen is introduced as an audience surrogate , in the mould of the girl next door archetype , much like the perennial companion character in Doctor Who . However , as the series progressed , the production team chose to emphasise contradictory aspects to her character by having Gwen make ethically dubious decisions . As the show progresses , and even after becoming a mother , Gwen evolves into a more militant action heroine and finds herself willing to make tough decisions to protect those closest to her . Reviewers have generally responded positively to the complexity of Gwen 's character and Eve Myles ' portrayal , though critics found fault with her more prosaic characterisation earlier on . Eve Myles ' portrayal of Gwen has been cited as effective in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent .",

Within the series narrative , Esther is a Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) watch analyst who becomes aware of the defunct British Torchwood Institute on Miracle Day , when it is discovered that no one can die . Alongside her CIA colleague Rex Matheson she joins forces with the last two remaining Torchwood agents to investigate the phenomenon . Esther 's standing as a desk-bound computer and technology expert puts her in contrast with the tougher and more action-orientated characters in the series . By the Miracle Day finale , Esther has become a more competent field agent , but is murdered by the group 's enemies in an attempt to stop them progressing with their mission . Havins was influenced in her decision to accept the part by her husband 's appreciation of the series .

Initially a recurring character , Rhys ' role is increased after the second series ; actor Kai Owen is given star billing from the show 's third series - a five-part serial subtitled Torchwood : Children of Earth - onwards . The character has gone on to appear in expanded universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks , comic books and radio plays . Throughout the first series ( 2006 ) , Rhys is initially unaware of Gwen 's vocation as a Torchwood agent , believing her to work in generic special forces . Gwen 's relationship with Rhys languishes while she is unable to communicate fully with him , but in the early part of series two ( 2008 ) he discovers the truth , and from then on in their relationship is revitalised ; the two enter a marriage based on honesty later in the series . In the third series ( 2009 ) Rhys becomes directly involved in assisting the Torchwood team in lieu of a fourth team member . In the show 's fourth series - a 2011 BBC/Starz co-production - Rhys again finds himself having to assist Torchwood , though he would rather live a domestic life with Gwen and their daughter Anwen . The original intention of the writers had been to kill off Rhys at the end of the first series , but series creator Russell T Davies found it necessary to keep the show grounded through Rhys as Gwen evolved as a character . Producer Richard Stokes stated that without him , it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi people , running around and hunting aliens . Following from the first series the production team decided to make Rhys less of a sap whilst continuing to use him as a contrast to Torchwood 's activities and its charismatic leader Jack Harkness . Whilst early response to the character was mixed - the character was parodied as Barry Backstory - subsequent reviews praised the character 's larger role in later episodes .",

Though those she works for are defeated in the series finale , it is revealed that Jilly has survived , leaving the character 's future uncertain . The character is used by the production team to provide commentary on mass-media ; she is ostensibly first and foremost concerned with profiting from global events .
