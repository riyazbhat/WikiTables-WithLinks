Brooks , a Democrat , was a strong advocate of slavery and states ' rights . He is most remembered for his May 22 , 1856 , attack upon abolitionist and Republican Senator Charles Sumner , whom he beat nearly to death ; Brooks beat Sumner with a cane on the floor of the United States Senate in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech in which Sumner verbally attacked Brooks 's second cousin , South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler . Brooks 's action received widespread adoration in South Carolina and other Southern states - the city of Brooksville , Florida named itself for him immediately afterwards , as did Brooks County , Georgia - and abhorrence in the North . An attempt to oust him from the House of Representatives failed , and he received only token punishment in his criminal trial . He resigned his seat in July 1856 ; his constituents reelected him in a special election , held in August to fill the vacancy created by his resignation . He was re-elected to a full term in November 1856 , but died in January 1857 , five weeks before the new term began in March . Sumner was seriously injured by Brooks 's beating , and was unable to resume his seat in the Senate for three years , though eventually he recovered and resumed his Senate career . [ full citation needed ] The Massachusetts Legislature reelected Sumner in 1856 , and let his seat sit vacant during his absence as a reminder of Southern brutality . The caning had an enormous impact on the events that followed over the next four years . As a result of the caning , the country was pushed , inexorably and unstoppably , to civil war .",
