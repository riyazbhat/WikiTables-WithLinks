  "/wiki/Ariane_5": "Ariane 5 is a European heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family , an expendable launch system designed by the French government space agency Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales ( CNES ) . It is used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) or low Earth orbit ( LEO ) . German and French government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane . Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales . Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles , leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors . Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the Ariane programme . The rockets are launched by Arianespace from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana . Ariane 5 succeeded Ariane 4 , but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch . Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions , G , G+ , GS , ECA , and most recently , ES . ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the Hermes spaceplane , and thus intended it to be human rated from the beginning . Ariane 5 has a commonly used dual-launch capability where up to two large geostationary belt communication satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier ( Syst\u00e8me de Lancement Double Ariane , Ariane Double-Launch System ) . Up to three , somewhat smaller , main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA ( Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane , Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure )",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .
