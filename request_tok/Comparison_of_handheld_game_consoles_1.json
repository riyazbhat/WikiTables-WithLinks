  "/wiki/Central_processing_unit": "A central processing unit ( CPU ) , also called a central processor or main processor , is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program . The CPU performs basic arithmetic , logic , controlling , and input/output ( I/O ) operations specified by the instructions . The computer industry used the term central processing unit as early as 1955 . Traditionally , the term CPU refers to a processor , more specifically to its processing unit and control unit ( CU ) , distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry . The form , design , and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history , but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged . Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) that performs arithmetic and logic operations , processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations , and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching ( from memory ) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU , registers and other components . Most modern CPUs are microprocessors , where the CPU is contained on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) integrated circuit ( IC ) chip . An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory , peripheral interfaces , and other components of a computer ; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip ( SoC ) . Some computers employ a multi-core processor , which is a single chip containing two or more CPUs called cores ; in that context , one can speak of such single chips as sockets . Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel , with no unit considered central . There also exists the concept of virtual CPUs which are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources",
  "/wiki/Clock_rate": "The clock rate typically refers to the frequency at which the clock generator of a processor can generate pulses , which are used to synchronize the operations of its components , and is used as an indicator of the processor 's speed . It is measured in clock cycles per second or its equivalent , the SI unit hertz ( Hz ) . The clock rate of the first generation of computers was measured in hertz or kilohertz ( kHz ) , the first personal computers ( PCs ) to arrive throughout the 1970s and 1980s had clock rates measured in megahertz ( MHz ) , and in the 21st century the speed of modern CPUs is commonly advertised in gigahertz ( GHz ) . This metric is most useful when comparing processors within the same family , holding constant other features that may affect performance . Video card and CPU manufacturers commonly select their highest performing units from a manufacturing batch and set their maximum clock rate higher , fetching a higher price . [ citation needed ]",

The line was originally designed in 45 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ( CMOS ) technology and subsequent models , codenamed Cedar , used a 32 nm process . The first generation of Atom processors are based on the Bonnell microarchitecture . On December 21 , 2009 , Intel announced the Pine Trail platform , including new Atom processor code-named Pineview ( Atom N450 ) , with total kit power consumption down 20 % . On December 28 , 2011 , Intel updated the Atom line with the Cedar processors . In December 2012 , Intel launched the 64-bit Centerton family of Atom CPUs , designed specifically for use in servers . Centerton adds features previously unavailable in Atom processors , such as Intel VT virtualization technology and support for ECC memory . On September 4 , 2013 Intel launched a 22 nm successor to Centerton , codenamed Avoton .

  "/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost": "Intel Turbo Boost is Intel 's trade name for a feature that automatically raises certain of its processors ' operating frequency , and thus performance , when demanding tasks are running . Turbo-Boost-enabled processors are the Core i3 , Core i5 , Core i7 , Core i9 and Xeon series manufactured since 2008 , more particularly , those based on the Nehalem , Sandy Bridge , and later microarchitectures . The frequency is accelerated when the operating system requests the highest performance state of the processor . Processor performance states are defined by the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( ACPI ) specification , an open standard supported by all major operating systems ; no additional software or drivers are required to support the technology . The design concept behind Turbo Boost is commonly referred to as dynamic overclocking . When the workload on the processor calls for faster performance , the processor 's clock will try to increase the operating frequency in regular increments as required to meet demand . The increased clock rate is limited by the processor 's power , current , and thermal limits , the number of cores currently in use , and the maximum frequency of the active cores . Frequency increases occur in increments of 133 MHz for Nehalem processors and 100 MHz for Sandy Bridge , Ivy Bridge , Haswell and Skylake processors . When any electrical or thermal limits are exceeded , the operating frequency automatically decreases in decrements of 133 or 100 MHz until the processor is again operating within its design limits . Turbo Boost 2.0 was introduced in 2011 with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture , while Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 was introduced in 2016 with the Broadwell-E microarchitecture",

M.2 replaces the mSATA standard , which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and connectors . Employing a more flexible physical specification , the M.2 allows different module widths and lengths , and , paired with the availability of more advanced interfacing features , makes the M.2 more suitable than mSATA in general for solid-state storage applications , and particularly in smaller devices such as ultrabooks and tablets . Computer bus interfaces provided through the M.2 connector are PCI Express 3.0 ( up to four lanes ) , Serial ATA 3.0 , and USB 3.0 ( a single logical port for each of the latter two ) . It is up to the manufacturer of the M.2 host or module to select which interfaces are to be supported , depending on the desired level of host support and device type .

  "/wiki/Solid_state_drive": "A solid-state drive ( SSD ) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently , typically using flash memory , and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage . It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk , although SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read-write heads used in hard drives ( HDD ) or floppy disks . Compared with the electromechanical drives , SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock , run silently , and have quicker access time and lower latency . SSDs store data in semiconductor cells . As of 2019 , cells can contain between 1 and 4 bits of data . SSD storage devices vary in their properties according to the number of bits stored in each cell , with single bit cells ( SLC ) being generally the most reliable , durable , fast , and expensive type , compared with 2 and 3 bit cells ( MLC and TLC ) , and finally quad bit cells ( QLC ) being used for consumer devices that do not require such extreme properties and are the cheapest of the four . In addition , 3D XPoint memory ( sold by Intel under the Optane brand ) , stores data by changing the electrical resistance of cells instead of storing electrical charges in cells , and SSDs made from RAM can be used for high speed , when data persistence after power loss is not required , or may use battery power to retain data when its usual power source is unavailable . Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives ( SSHDs ) , such as Apple 's Fusion Drive , combine features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit using both flash memory and a HDD in order to improve the performance of frequently-accessed data . While the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time , SSDs are ( as of 2020 [ update ] ) still more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs and are expected to remain so into the next decade . SSDs based on NAND Flash will slowly leak charge over time if left for long periods without power . This causes worn-out drives ( that have exceeded their endurance rating ) to start losing data typically after one year ( if stored at 30 \u00b0C ) to two years ( at 25 \u00b0C ) in storage ; for new drives it takes longer . Therefore , SSDs are not suitable for archival storage",

It superseded the original DDR SDRAM specification , and is superseded by DDR3 SDRAM ( launched in 2007 ) . DDR2 DIMMs are neither forward compatible with DDR3 nor backward compatible with DDR . In addition to double pumping the data bus as in DDR SDRAM ( transferring data on the rising and falling edges of the bus clock signal ) , DDR2 allows higher bus speed and requires lower power by running the internal clock at half the speed of the data bus . The two factors combine to produce a total of four data transfers per internal clock cycle . Since the DDR2 internal clock runs at half the DDR external clock rate , DDR2 memory operating at the same external data bus clock rate as DDR results in DDR2 being able to provide the same bandwidth but with better latency . Alternatively , DDR2 memory operating at twice the external data bus clock rate as DDR may provide twice the bandwidth with the same latency . The best-rated DDR2 memory modules are at least twice as fast as the best-rated DDR memory modules .

These commands can be pipelined to improve performance , with previously started operations completing while new commands are received . The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks , allowing the device to operate on a memory access command in each bank simultaneously and speed up access in an interleaved fashion . This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could . Pipelining means that the chip can accept a new command before it has finished processing the previous one . For a pipelined write , the write command can be immediately followed by another command without waiting for the data to be written into the memory array . For a pipelined read , the requested data appears a fixed number of clock cycles ( latency ) after the read command , during which additional commands can be sent . The first commercial SDRAM was the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip , introduced in 1992 . SDRAM is widely used in computers",

  "/wiki/N-Gage_(device)": "The N-Gage was a smartphone combining features of a mobile phone and a handheld game system developed by Nokia , announced on 4 November 2002 and released on 7 October 2003 . It runs the original Series 60 platform on Symbian OS v6.1 . N-Gage attempted to lure gamers away from the Game Boy Advance by including telephone functionality . This was unsuccessful , partly because the buttons , designed for a telephone , were not well-suited for gaming . The original N-Gage was described as resembling a taco , which led to its mocking nickname Taco phone . Nokia introduced the N-Gage QD in 2004 as a redesign of the original Classic N-Gage , fixing widely criticized issues and design problems . However , the new model was unable to make an impact , and with only 2 million units sold in its two years , the N-Gage and its QD model were a commercial failure , unable to challenge their Nintendo rival . The N-Gage was discontinued in November 2005 , with Nokia moving its gaming capabilities onto selected Series 60 smartphones .
