  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person , place , or thing after whom or after which something is named , or believed to be named , or the thing so named . The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic .

Born into a family of artists , Calder 's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1920s and was soon championed by the Museum of Modern Art in New York , resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943 . Major retrospectives were also held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ( 1964 ) and the Museum of Contemporary Art , Chicago ( 1974 ) . Calder 's work is in many permanent collections , most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art , but also the Guggenheim Museum ; the Museum of Modern Art ; the National Gallery of Art , Washington , D.C. ; and the Centre Georges Pompidou . He produced many large public works , including .125 ( at JFK Airport , 1957 ) , Pittsburgh ( Carnegie International prize winner 1958 , Pittsburgh International Airport ) Spirale ( UNESCO in Paris , 1958 ) , Flamingo and Universe ( both in Chicago , 1974 ) , and Mountains and Clouds ( Hart Senate Office Building , Washington , D.C. , 1996 ) . Although primarily known for his sculpture , Calder also created paintings and prints , miniatures ( such as his famous Cirque Calder ) , theater set design , jewelry design , tapestries and rugs , and political posters . Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998 , and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom , posthumously in 1977 , after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War . An important work of Calder 's is the monumental Floating Clouds ( 1952-1953 ) of the Aula Magna ( Central University of Venezuela ) of the University City of Caracas in Venezuela . This work is a Unesco World Heritage Site . Calder 's clouds were specially designed to combine art and technology , making the auditorium one of the top 5 university auditoriums in the world by sound quality .",

His paintings combine a realistic observation of the human state , both physical and emotional , with a dramatic use of lighting , which had a formative influence on Baroque painting . Caravaggio employed close physical observation with a dramatic use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism . He made the technique a dominant stylistic element , darkening shadows and transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light . Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes , often featuring violent struggles , torture and death . He worked rapidly , with live models , preferring to forgo drawings and work directly onto the canvas . His influence on the new Baroque style that emerged from Mannerism was profound . It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Peter Paul Rubens , Jusepe de Ribera , Gian Lorenzo Bernini , and Rembrandt , and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the Caravaggisti or Caravagesques , as well as tenebrists or tenebrosi ( shadowists ) . Caravaggio trained as a painter in Milan before moving in his twenties to Rome . He developed a considerable name as an artist , and as a violent , touchy and provocative man . A brawl led to a death sentence for murder and forced him to flee to Naples . There he again established himself as one of the most prominent Italian painters of his generation .",

His career as a playwright produced four classics , and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics . Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg , Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre . Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career : Medicine is my lawful wife , he once said , and literature is my mistress . Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896 , but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski 's Moscow Art Theatre , which subsequently also produced Chekhov 's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays , Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard . These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences , because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a theatre of mood and a submerged life in the text . Chekhov had at first written stories to earn money , but as his artistic ambition grew , he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story . He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers , insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions , not to answer them .",

George Bernard Shaw , his friendly enemy , said of him , He was a man of colossal genius . Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold , Thomas Carlyle , Cardinal John Henry Newman , and John Ruskin .",

  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 ."
