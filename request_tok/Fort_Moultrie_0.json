  "/wiki/Pierce_M._Butler": "Pierce Mason Butler ( April 11 , 1798August 20 , 1847 ) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the 56th Governor of South Carolina from 1836 to 1838 . He was killed while serving as colonel of the Palmetto Regiment at the Battle of Churubusco , during the Mexican-American War . Born in Edgefield County , South Carolina , Butler was a son of William Butler ( 1759-1821 ) and a brother of Andrew Pickens Butler and William Butler , Jr. , all of whom served in the United States Congress . He was educated by Moses Waddel at the Willington Academy in Willington , South Carolina . Butler was appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1818 and rose to the rank of captain before resigning his commission in 1829 . Following his term as Governor of South Carolina , he became agent to the Cherokee at Fort Gibson ( present day Muskogee County , Oklahoma ) , a post he held until 1846 . Following his death in Mexico , Butler 's body was returned to South Carolina for burial . He was first entombed at Trinity Episcopal Church , just across from the State House . In December 1853 he was reburied in the Butler Family Cemetery , in the graveyard of what is now Butler Methodist Church in Saluda County . Others buried in the plot are his father , Major General William Butler , his mother , Behethland Foote Moore Butler , a sister , five of his six brothers , Colonel Zachariah Smith Brooks , grandfather of Preston Brooks , and two children of his brother William , the only sibling not buried there . He is buried at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenville . Collectively they were four Colonels , one General , one Lt .",
  "/wiki/12-inch_coast_defense_mortar": "The 12-inch coast defense mortar was a weapon of caliber emplaced during the 1890s and early 20th century to defend US harbors from seaborne attack . In 1886 , when the Endicott Board set forth its initial plan for upgrading the coast defenses of the United States , it relied primarily on mortars , not guns , to defend American harbors . Over the years , provision was made for fortifications that would mount some 476 of these weapons , although not all of these tubes were installed . Ninety-one of these weapons were remounted as railway artillery in 1918-1919 , but this was too late to see action in World War I . The railway mortars were only deployed in small quantities , and none overseas . The fixed mortars in the Philippines saw action in the Japanese invasion in World War II . All of the fixed mortars ( except four ) in the United States were scrapped by 1944 , as new weapons replaced them , and the railway mortars were scrapped after the war . Today , the only remaining mortars of this type in the 50 states are four at Battery Laidley , part of Fort Desoto near St. Petersburg , Florida , but the remains of coast defense mortar emplacements can be seen at many former Coast Artillery forts across the United States and its former territories . Additional 12-inch mortars and other large-caliber weapons remain in the Philippines .",
  "/wiki/Barbette": "Barbettes are several types of gun emplacement in terrestrial fortifications or on naval ships . In recent naval usage , a barbette is a protective circular armour support for a heavy gun turret . This evolved from earlier forms of gun protection that eventually led to the pre-dreadnought . The name barbette ultimately comes from fortification - it originally meant a raised platform or mound , as in the French phrase en barbette , which refers to the practice of firing a cannon over a parapet rather than through an embrasure in a fortification 's casemate . The former gives better angles of fire but less protection than the latter . The disappearing gun was a variation on the barbette gun ; it consisted of a heavy gun on a carriage that would retract behind a parapet or into a gunpit for reloading . Barbettes were primarily used in coastal defences , but saw some use in a handful of warships , and some inland fortifications . The term is also used for certain aircraft gun mounts . Shipboard barbettes were primarily used in armoured warships - starting in the 1860s during a period of intense experimentation with other mounting systems for heavy guns at sea . In these , gun barrels usually protruded over the barbette edge , so barbettes provided only partial protection , mainly for the ammunition supply . Alternatives included the heavily-armoured gun turret and an armoured , fixed central gun battery . By the late 1880s , all three systems were replaced with a hybrid barbette-turret system that combined the benefits of both types .",
  "/wiki/William_Jasper": "William Jasper ( circa 1750 - October 9 , 1779 ) was a noted American soldier in the Revolutionary War . He was a sergeant in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment . Jasper distinguished himself in the defense of Fort Moultrie ( then called Fort Sullivan ) on June 28 , 1776 . When a shell from a British warship shot away the flagstaff , he recovered the South Carolina flag in the Battle of Sullivan 's Island , raised it on a temporary staff , and held it under fire until a new staff was installed . Governor John Rutledge gave his sword to Jasper in recognition of his bravery . In 1779 , Sergeant Jasper participated in the Siege of Savannah , led by General Lincoln , which failed to recapture Savannah , Georgia , from the British . He was mortally wounded during an assault on the British forces there . Sgt . Jasper 's story is similar to that of Sgt . John Newton . Several states have adjacent counties named Jasper and Newton , as these were remembered as a pair , due to the popularity of Parson Weems ' memorializing early American history . Several other states have a Jasper County with a county seat of Newton , or vice versa .",
  "/wiki/10-inch_gun_M1888": "The 10-inch Gun M1895 ( 254 mm ) and its variants the M1888 and M1900 were large coastal artillery pieces installed to defend major American seaports between 1895 and 1945 . For most of their history they were operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps . Most were installed on disappearing carriages , with early installations on barbette mountings . All of the weapons not in the Philippines ( except four guns in Canada ) were scrapped during World War II . Two of the surviving weapons were relocated from the Philippines to Fort Casey in Washington state in the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Disappearing_gun": "A disappearing gun , a gun mounted on a disappearing carriage , is an obsolete type of artillery which enabled a gun to hide from direct fire and observation . The overwhelming majority of carriage designs enabled the gun to rotate backwards and down behind a parapet , or into a pit protected by a wall after it was fired ; a small number were simply barbette mounts on a retractable platform . Either way , retraction lowered the gun from view and direct fire by the enemy while it was being reloaded . It also made reloading easier , since it lowered the breech to a level just above the loading platform , and shells could be rolled right up to the open breech for loading and ramming . Other benefits over non-disappearing types were a higher rate of repetitive fire and less fatigue for the gun crew . Some disappearing carriages were complicated mechanisms , protection from aircraft observation and attack was difficult , and almost all restricted the elevation of the gun . With a few exceptions , construction of new disappearing gun installations ceased by 1918 . The last new disappearing gun installation was a solo 16-inch gun M1919 at Fort Michie on Great Gull Island , New York , completed in 1923 . In the U.S. , due to lack of funding for sufficient replacements , the disappearing gun remained the most numerous type of coast defense weapon until replaced by improved weapons in World War II . Although some early designs were intended as field siege guns , over time the design became associated with fixed fortifications , most of which were coastal artillery . A late exception was the use in mountain fortifications in Switzerland , where six 120mm guns on rail-mounted Saint Chamond disappearing carriages remained at Fort de Dailly until replaced in 1940 . The disappearing gun was usually moved down behind the parapet or into its protective housing by the force of its own recoil , which ( on many models ) lifted a counterweight .",

  "/wiki/George_Edwin_Lord": "George Edwin Lord ( February 17 , 1846 - June 25 , 1876 ) was a U.S. Army Assistant Surgeon in the 7th Cavalry who was killed in the Battle of the Little Big Horn in Montana Territory during the Black Hills War . Lord was born in Brunswick , Maine and graduated from Bowdoin College . He attended medical school and moved west to serve in the U.S. Army at various forts and outposts . He entered into another contract with the U. S. Army in January 1875 and was made a first lieutenant in the 7th Cavalry , posted in Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakota Territory . During the Great Sioux War , he accompanied Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer 's column towards the Little Bighorn River , where he was killed in action . Dr. Lord 's body was not positively identified by the first burial crews , and he was initially listed by General Alfred H. Terry and others as missing in action . Captain Otto E. Michaelis and Lieutenant Richard E. Thompson , however , later contacted Lord 's brother with their belief that a body sighted on the field had been the doctor 's , based on a blue shirt the corpse was wearing as well as the shapely hands , the moustache , and general appearance . Michaelis also thought the socks on the corpse were from the same set of three pairs Lord had earlier purchased from a trader at Powder River . Based on this new information , three months after the battle Terry recommended that Lord 's status be changed to killed in action . However , there is no marker with Lord 's name at the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument that specifically marks this reported death site . In 1890 , a marker for Lord was placed on the so-called South Skirmish Line , based on the discovery there of buttons that were thought to be part of a staff officer 's uniform which doctors would wear . Lord 's surgical kit eventually was recovered from the Indians and sent to the Army 's medical museum .",
