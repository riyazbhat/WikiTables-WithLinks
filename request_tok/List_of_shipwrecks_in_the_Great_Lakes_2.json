  "/wiki/Lake_freighter": "Lake freighters , or lakers , are bulk carrier vessels that ply the Great Lakes of North America . These vessels are traditionally called boats , although classified as ships . Since the late 19th century , lakers have carried bulk cargoes of materials such as limestone , iron ore , grain , coal , or salt from the mines and fields of the upper Great Lakes to the populous industrial areas farther east . The 63 commercial ports handled 173 million tons of cargo in 2006 . Because of winter ice on the lakes , the navigation season is not usually year-round . The Soo Locks and Welland Canal close from mid-January to late March , when most boats are laid up for maintenance . Crewmembers spend these months ashore . Depending on their application , lakers may also be referred to by their type , such as oreboats ( primarily for iron ore ) , straight deckers ( no self-unloading gear ) , bulkers ( carry bulk cargo ) , sternenders ( all cabins aft ) , self unloaders ( with self unloading gear ) , longboats ( for their slender appearance ) , or lakeboats , among others . In the mid-20th century , 300 lakers worked the Lakes , but by the early 21st century there were fewer than 140 active lakers .

Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852 , economic forces have led to continued development of these ships , resulting in increased size and sophistication . Today 's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity , safety , efficiency , and durability . Today , bulk carriers make up 21 % of the world 's merchant fleets and range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) . A number of specialized designs exist : some can unload their own cargo , some depend on port facilities for unloading , and some even package the cargo as it is loaded . Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek , Japanese , or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama . South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers , and 82 % of these ships were built in Asia . On bulk carriers , crew are involved in operation management and maintenance of the vessel taking care of safety , navigation , maintenance and cargo care , in accordance with international maritime legislation . Cargo loading operations vary in complexity and loading and discharging of cargo can take several days . Bulk carriers can be gearless ( dependent upon terminal equipment ) or geared ( having cranes integral to the vessel ) .

  "/wiki/Chicago_River": "The Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of 156 miles ( 251 km ) that runs through the city of Chicago , including its center ( the Chicago Loop ) . Though not especially long , the river is notable because it is one of the reasons for Chicago 's geographic importance : the related Chicago Portage is a link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basin , and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico . The River is also noteworthy for its natural and human-engineered history . In 1887 , the Illinois General Assembly decided to reverse the flow of the Chicago River through civil engineering by taking water from Lake Michigan and discharging it into the Mississippi River watershed , partly in response to concerns created by an extreme weather event in 1885 that threatened the city 's water supply . In 1889 , the Illinois General Assembly created the Chicago Sanitary District ( now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District ) to replace the Illinois and Michigan Canal with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , a much larger waterway , because the former had become inadequate to serve the city 's increasing sewage and commercial navigation needs . Completed by 1900 , the project reversed the flow of the Main Stem and South Branch of the Chicago River by using a series of canal locks and increasing the flow from Lake Michigan into the river , causing the river to empty into the new Canal instead . In 1999 , the system was named a 'Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium ' by the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) . The river is represented on the Municipal Flag of Chicago by two horizontal blue stripes . Its three branches serve as the inspiration for the Municipal Device , a three-branched , Y-shaped symbol that is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago",

Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20 % of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone .
