Before it was founded in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell , the area was a deserted heathland occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers . Initially marketed as a health resort , the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville 's 1841 book , The Spas of England . Bournemouth 's growth accelerated with the arrival of the railway , and it became a town in 1870 . Historically part of Hampshire , it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974 . Through local government changes in 1997 , the town began to be administered by a unitary authority independent of Dorset County Council , although it remains part of that ceremonial county .

Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points .
