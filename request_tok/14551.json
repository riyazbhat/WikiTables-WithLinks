  "/wiki/Star_designation": "In astronomy , stars have a variety of different stellar designations and names , including catalogue designations , current and historical proper names , and foreign language names . Only a tiny minority of known stars have proper names ; all others have only designations from various catalogues or lists , or no identifier at all . Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC enumerated about 850 naked-eye stars . Johann Bayer in 1603 listed about twice this number . Only in the 19th century did star catalogues list the naked-eye stars exhaustively . The Bright Star Catalogue , which is a star catalogue listing all stars of apparent magnitude 6.5 or brighter , or roughly every star visible to the naked eye from Earth , contains 9,096 stars . The most voluminous modern catalogues list on the order of a billion stars , out of an estimated total of 200 to 400 billion in the Milky Way . Proper names may be historical , often transliterated from Arabic or Chinese names . Such transliterations can vary so there may be multiple spellings . A smaller number of names have been introduced since the Middle Ages , and a few in modern times as nicknames have come into popular use , for example Sualocin for \u03b1 Delphini and Navi for \u03b3 Cassiopeiae . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) has begun a process to select and formalise unique proper names for the brighter naked-eye stars and for other stars of popular interest . To the IAU , name refers to the ( usually colloquial ) term used for a star in everyday speech , while designation is solely alphanumerical and used almost exclusively in official catalogues and for professional astronomy .",
  "/wiki/Apparent_magnitude": "Apparent magnitude ( m ) is the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from the Earth . An object 's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity , its distance from Earth , and any extinction of the object 's light by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer . The magnitude scale is reverse logarithmic . An object with a magnitude 5 higher than another 's magnitude is 100 times dimmer . Consequently , a difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of 5\u221a100 or about 2.512 . The brighter an object is , the lower its magnitude . For example , a star of magnitude 2.0 is 2.512 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3.0 , or 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 7.0 . The brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes : for example , Venus at \u22124.2 or Sirius at \u22121.46 . The faintest naked-eye stars visible on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about +6.5 . The apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the Sun at \u221226.7 to objects in deep Hubble Space Telescope images of around magnitude +30 . The measurement of apparent magnitude is called photometry . Photometric measurements are made in the ultraviolet , visible , or infrared wavelength bands using standard passband filters belonging to photometric systems such as the UBV system or the Str\u00f6mgren uvby\u03b2 system .",
  "/wiki/Stellar_classification": "In astronomy , stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics . Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines . Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule , with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element . The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere , although in some cases there are true abundance differences . The spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state , giving an objective measure of the photosphere 's temperature . Most stars are currently classified under the Morgan-Keenan ( MK ) system using the letters O , B , A , F , G , K , and M , a sequence from the hottest ( O type ) to the coolest ( M type ) . Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest ( e.g . A8 , A9 , F0 , and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler ) . The sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system , such as class D for white dwarfs and classes S and C for carbon stars . In the MK system , a luminosity class is added to the spectral class using Roman numerals . This is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star 's spectrum , which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs . Luminosity class 0 or Ia+ is used for hypergiants , class I for supergiants , class II for bright giants , class III for regular giants , class IV for sub-giants , class V for main-sequence stars , class sd ( or VI ) for sub-dwarfs , and class D ( or VII ) for white dwarfs .",
