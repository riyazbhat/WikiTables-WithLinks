  "/wiki/Census-designated_place": "A census-designated place ( CDP ) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only . CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places , such as self-governing cities , towns , and villages , for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data . CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated community , for which the CDP is named , plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and , occasionally , other , smaller unincorporated communities as well . CDPs include small rural communities , colonias located along the Mexico-United States border , and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs . The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status and may not always correspond with the local understanding of the area or community with the same name . However , criteria established for the 2010 Census require that a CDP name be one that is recognized and used in daily communication by the residents of the community ( not a name developed solely for planning or other purposes ) and recommend that a CDP 's boundaries be mapped based on the geographic extent associated with inhabitants ' regular use of the named place . The Census Bureau states that census-designated places are not considered incorporated places and that it includes only census-designated places in its city population list for Hawaii because that state has no incorporated cities . In addition , census city lists from 2007 included Arlington County , Virginia 's CDP in the list with the incorporated places , but since 2010 , only the Urban Honolulu CDP , Hawaii representing the historic core of Honolulu , Hawaii , is shown in the city and town estimates .",
