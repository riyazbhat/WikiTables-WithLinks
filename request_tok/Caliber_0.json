  "/wiki/.22_Short": ".22 Short is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . Developed in 1857 for the first Smith & Wesson revolver , the .22 rimfire was the first American metallic cartridge . The original loading was a 29 or 30 gr ( 0.066 or 0.069 oz ; 1.879 or 1.944 g ) bullet and 4 gr ( 0.0091 oz ; 0.2592 g ) of black powder . The original .22 rimfire cartridge was renamed .22 Short with the introduction of the .22 Long in 1871 . Developed for self defense , the modern .22 Short , though still used in a few pocket pistols and mini-revolvers , is mainly used as a quiet round for practice by the recreational shooter . The .22 Short was popularly used in shooting galleries at fairs and arcades ; several rifle makers produced gallery models for .22 Short exclusively . Due to its low recoil and good inherent accuracy , the .22 Short was used for the Olympic 25 meter rapid fire pistol event until 2004 , and they were allowed in the shooting part of modern pentathlon competitions before they switched to air pistols . Several makes of starter pistols use .22 Short blank cartridges . Some powder-actuated nail guns use the .22 Short cartridge as a power source",
  "/wiki/.22_Long": ".22 Long is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . The .22 Long is the second-oldest of the surviving rimfire cartridges , dating back to 1871 , when it was loaded with a 29 grain ( 1.9 g ) bullet and 5 grains ( 0.32 g ) of black powder , 25 % more than the .22 Short it was based on . It was designed for use in revolvers , but was soon chambered in rifles as well , in which it gained a strong reputation as a small game cartridge , and sold very well . In 1887 the .22 Long case was combined with the heavier 40 grain ( 2.6 g ) bullet of the .22 Extra Long of 1880 to produce the .22 Long Rifle giving a longer overall length , a higher muzzle energy and superior performance as a hunting and target round , rendering the .22 Long and .22 Extra Long obsolete . Many firearms designed for the .22 Long Rifle will chamber and fire the shorter round , though the .22 Long generally does not generate sufficient energy to operate semi-automatic guns . The one prominent survivor of the .22 Long is the .22 CB Long , a long-cased version of the .22 CB . While the original .22 Long loading used the same powder charge as the .22 Long Rifle , the .22 Long bullet was significantly lighter , and the combination did not result in higher velocities for the .22 Long when fired from a rifle . The large barrel volume to chamber volume ratio of a .22 rimfire rifle means that the powder gasses have expanded as far as they can well before the bullet reaches the muzzle of a normal length rifle barrel , and the light .22 Long bullet has less inertia than the .22 Long Rifle . This means that the .22 Long bullet ( and to a lesser extent the .22 Long Rifle in most loadings ) actually slows down significantly before it exits the barrel . For farmers , or for those who only hunted small game such as squirrel or cottontail rabbit , the differences in performance between the .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle cartridges were of little importance . The quieter report and lower penetration of the .22 Long cartridge were often seen as desirable qualities . Since the .22 Long Rifle performs as well in a short handgun barrel as the .22 Long and outperforms it significantly in a long rifle barrel , the development of the .22 Long Rifle assured the .22 Long 's path to obsolescence",

While the .219 Zipper was supposed to compete against other varmint cartridges of the time , most lever-action rifles use tubular magazines , which prohibit the use of pointed bullets . This led to problems with accuracy . Winchester stopped producing .219 Zipper ammunition in 1962 , Remington Arms stopped production of the cartridge soon afterwards . The .219 Zipper is the parent case of the .219 Donaldson Wasp , and P.O . Ackley created the .219 Zipper Improved in 1937 . Leslie Lindahl 's Chucker and Super-chucker and wildcat case modifications by Hervey Lovell , Lysle Kilbourne , and W. F.

Unlike many new cartridges , it has no parent case ; the complete package was developed from scratch by FN . The 5.7\u00d728mm was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 PDW and FN Five-seven pistol , in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . In 2002 and 2003 , NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge and the 4.6\u00d730mm cartridge , which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7\u00d728mm . The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge , citing superior performance in testing , but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted .

It is however held in high regard for its accuracy and is widely considered the grandfather of benchrest cartridges . Today the round occupies a niche in the falling-block rifle market . There are three notable versions of the Wasp . The first , designed in the mid 1930s and today known as the 219 Gipson Wasp , was named after the gunsmith who chambered the first Wasp rifle for Donaldson . This version has a case length measuring 1.625 and was formed from rimless 25 Remington brass . Donaldson shifted his experimentation to the 219 Zipper brass soon after the introduction of that cartridge by Winchester in 1937 . By approximately 1940 Donaldson had lengthened the body of the Wasp case to increase capacity from around 24 to 28 grains of IMR 3031 powder - to see if velocity could be increased while maintaining accuracy . To Donaldson 's delight , the larger case produced both higher velocity and superior accuracy . This development work is detailed in a series of letters written by Donaldson and collectively published in Yours Truly .

  "/wiki/7mm_Remington_Magnum": "The 7mm Remington Magnum rifle cartridge was introduced as a commercially available round in 1962 , along with the new Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle . It is a member of the belted magnum family that is directly derived from the venerable .375 H & H Magnum . The original purpose of the belted magnum concept taken from the .300 H & H Magnum and .375 H & H Magnum , was to provide precise headspace control , since the sloping shoulders , while easing cartridge extraction , were unsuitable for this purpose . Improved cartridge extraction reliability is desirable while hunting dangerous game , which would be of concern when needing a fast follow up shot . The 7mm Remington Magnum is based on the commercial .264 Winchester Magnum , .338 Winchester Magnum , and .458 Winchester Magnum , which were based on the same belted .300 H & H Magnum and .375 H & H Magnum cases , trimmed to nearly the same length as the .270 Weatherby Magnum . On its introduction , the 7mm Remington Magnum substantially usurped the market share held by the .264 Winchester Magnum , which went into sharp decline in popularity and sales after 1962 .

It is known as .275 Rigby in the United Kingdom . It was developed by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company in 1892 and adopted as a military cartridge by Spain in 1893 . It was subsequently adopted by several other countries as the standard military cartridge , and although now obsolete as a military cartridge , it remains in widespread international use as a sporting round . Many sporting rifles in this calibre were made by British riflemakers , among whom John Rigby was prominent ; and , catering for the British preference for calibres to be designated in inches , Rigby called this chambering the .275 bore after the measurement of a 7 mm rifle 's bore across the lands",
  "/wiki/7\u00d764mm": "At the start of the 20th century the famous German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke ( 1865-1951 ) was experimenting with the engineering concept of lengthening and other dimensional changes regarding standard cartridge cases like the M/88 cartridge case , then used by the German military in their Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles , to obtain extra muzzle velocity . In 1912 , Brenneke designed the commercially rather unsuccessful 8\u00d764mm S cartridge ( again in production since 2001 ) . It was intended as a ballistic upgrade option for the Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles that were standard issue in the German military . The German military chose , however , to stay with their 8\u00d757mm IS rifle cartridge avoiding rechambering their service rifles for a cartridge that , due to its more favourable bore area to case volume ratio , would ballistically outperform the .30-06 Springfield cartridge of the United States Army . Brennekes engineering concept was to create new , very powerful ( for the era ) cartridges by enlarging exterior cartridge case dimensions like overall length and slightly larger case head diameter compared to the German 8\u00d757mm IS military cartridge case , coupled with an increase in maximum pressure . The concept was essentially sound , and he persisted in the development of new cartridges along this line . In 1917 Brenneke necked down his 8\u00d764mm S design of 1912 to 7 mm calibre , introduced it as the 7\u00d764mm , and achieved major commercial success . The 7\u00d764mm offered 10-12 % more muzzle velocity than the 7\u00d757mm Mauser . This results in a flatter trajectory and better performance at longer range . In the years between World War I and World War II , the 7\u00d764mm was often regarded by German hunters as a miracle cartridge , and dozens of different factory loads were available on the German market . It was so highly regarded that the Nazi German Wehrmacht , during the 1930s , even considered replacing the 8\u00d757mm IS in favour of the 7\u00d764mm for their snipers . The Wehrmacht decided - just like the German Army had in 1912 - to stay with the 8\u00d757mm IS cartridges for their Mauser Karabiner 98ks to keep logistics as simple as possible",

During the 1940s , the .300 Savage became the basis for experiments on behalf of the U.S. Military that resulted in the development of the T65 series of experimental cartridges . The original experimental case design by the Frankford Arsenal was designated the T65 and was similar to the .300 Savage case , but with less taper . The experimental cases were made from standard .30-06 Springfield cases which gave a little less capacity than standard .300 Savage cases because the Frankford Arsenal cases had slightly thicker case walls . The later T65 iterations were lengthened compared to the original T65 case and provided a ballistic performance roughly equal to the U.S. military .30-06 Springfield service cartridge . Over forty years of technical progress in the field of propellants allowed for similar service cartridge performance from a significantly shorter , smaller case with less case capacity . Winchester saw a market for a civilian model of the late T65 series designs and introduced it in 1952 , two years prior to the NATO adoption of the T65E5 experimental cartridge iteration under the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO designation in 1954 .
