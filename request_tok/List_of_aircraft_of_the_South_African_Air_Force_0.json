It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force ( Flygvapnet ) . The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls . It is powered by the Volvo RM12 , and has a top speed of Mach 2 . Later aircraft are modified for NATO interoperability standards and to undertake air to air refuelling . In 1979 , the Swedish government began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter , attack and reconnaissance missions to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen . A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39 , first flying in 1988 . Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft 's flight control software , the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996 . Upgraded variants , featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times , began entering service in 2003 . To market the aircraft internationally , Saab formed partnerships and collaborative efforts with overseas aerospace companies . One example of such efforts was Gripen International , a joint partnership between Saab and BAE Systems formed in 2001 . Gripen International was responsible for marketing the aircraft , and was heavily involved in the successful export of the type to South Africa ; the organisation was later dissolved amidst allegations of bribery being employed to secure foreign interest and sales .",

The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 .
