  "/wiki/Currency": "A currency ( from Middle English : curraunt , in circulation , from Latin : currens , -entis ) , in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange , especially circulating banknotes and coins . A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money ( monetary units ) in common use , especially for people in a nation . Under this definition , U.S. dollars ( US $ ) , euros ( \u20ac ) , Japanese yen ( \u00a5 ) , and pounds sterling ( \u00a3 ) are examples of currencies . These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets , which determine the relative values of the different currencies . Currencies in this sense are defined by governments , and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance . Other definitions of the term currency are discussed in their respective synonymous articles banknote , coin , and money . The latter definition , [ clarification needed ] pertaining to the currency systems of nations , is the topic of this article . Currencies can be classified into two monetary systems : fiat money and commodity money , depending on what guarantees the currency 's value ( the economy at large vs. the government 's physical metal reserves ) . Some currencies are legal tender in certain political jurisdictions . Others are simply traded for their economic value . Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet .",
  "/wiki/Gross_domestic_product": "Gross domestic product ( GDP ) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period . GDP ( nominal ) per capita does not , however , reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries ; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity ( PPP ) is arguably more useful when comparing living standards between nations , while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market . The OECD defines GDP as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services ( plus any taxes , and minus any subsidies , on products not included in the value of their outputs ) . An IMF publication states that , GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services - that are bought by the final user - produced in a country in a given period of time ( say a quarter or a year ) . Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy . The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP and the same is called Mean Standard of Living . GDP is considered the world 's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress .",
  "/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity": "Purchasing power parity ( PPP ) is a term that measures prices in different areas using a specific good or goods to contrast the absolute purchasing power between different currencies . In many cases , PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location . The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from the market exchange rate because of poverty , tariffs and other frictions . PPP exchange rates are widely used when comparing the GDP of different countries .",
  "/wiki/United_States_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5 % of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

The Spanish dollar was already prevalent throughout the West Indies in general , and from 1839 , the Spanish dollar unit operated in British Guiana in conjunction with British sterling coins at a standard conversion rate of one dollar for every four shillings and twopence . In 1951 the British sterling coinage was replaced with a new decimal coinage which was simultaneously introduced through all the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean . When sterling began to depreciate in the early 1970s , a switch to a US dollar peg became increasingly attractive as an anti-inflationary measure and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority ( of which Guyana was a member ) made the switch in October 1975 . The Guyanese dollar is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $ , or alternatively G $ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies .",

It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50 % of its prewar population and around 25-33 % of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Peruvian_nuevo_sol": "The sol ( Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8sol ] ; plural : soles ; currency sign : S/ ) is the currency of Peru ; it is subdivided into 100 c\u00e9ntimos ( cents ) . The ISO 4217 currency code is PEN . The sol replaced the Peruvian inti in 1991 and the name is a return to that of Peru 's historic currency , as the previous incarnation of sol was in use from 1863 to 1985 . Although sol in this usage is derived from the Latin solidus , the word also means sun in Spanish . There is thus a continuity with the old Peruvian inti , which was named after Inti , the Sun God of the Incas . At its introduction in 1991 , the currency was officially called nuevo sol ( new sol ) , but on November 13 , 2015 , the Peruvian Congress voted to rename the currency simply sol .",

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north , French Guiana to the east , Guyana to the west and Brazil to the south . At just under 165,000 square kilometers ( 64,000 square miles ) , it is the smallest sovereign state in South America . [ note 1 ] Suriname has a population of approximately 575,990 , most of whom live on the country 's north coast , in and around the capital and largest city , Paramaribo . Suriname was long inhabited by various indigenous people before being invaded and contested by European powers from the 16th century , eventually coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century . As the chief sugar colony during the Dutch colonial period , it was primarily a plantation economy dependent on African slaves and , following the abolition of slavery in 1863 , indentured servants from Asia . Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-chartered company Society of Suriname between 1683 and 1795 . In 1954 , Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . On 25 November 1975 , the country of Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an independent state , nonetheless maintaining close economic , diplomatic , and cultural ties to its former colonizer . Suriname is considered to be a culturally Caribbean country , and is a member of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) . While Dutch is the official language of government , business , media , and education , Sranan Tongo , an English-based creole language , is a widely used lingua franca .

With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers ( 68,000 sq mi ) , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America , after Suriname . Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento in 1680 ; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries . Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government .
