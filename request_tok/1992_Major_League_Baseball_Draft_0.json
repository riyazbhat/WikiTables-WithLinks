The Astros were established as the Houston Colt .45s and entered the National League as an expansion team in 1962 along with the New York Mets . The current name , reflecting Houston 's role as the host of the Johnson Space Center , was adopted three years later , when they moved into the Astrodome , the first domed sports stadium and the so-called eighth wonder of the world .

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast",

The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base",

The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name .

In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman",
