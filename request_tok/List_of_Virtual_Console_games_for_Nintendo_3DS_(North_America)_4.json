As Ness and his party of four , the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas . EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to . Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States , where it sold half as many copies as in Japan",

  "/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)": "Mega Man X [ a ] is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) . It was the first Mega Man game for the 16-bit console and the first game in the Mega Man X series , a spin-off of the original Mega Man series that began on the SNES 's predecessor , the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Mega Man X was released in Japan on December 17 , 1993 and was released in both North America and Europe the following year . Taking place a century after the original Mega Man series , Mega Man X is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and Reploids , robots capable of thinking , feeling , and growing like their human creators . Because of these complex attributes , many Reploids are prone to destructive , renegade activity and are thereafter referred to as Mavericks . The plot of the game follows the protagonist Mega Man X , an android member of a military task force called the Maverick Hunters . With the help of his partner Zero , X must thwart the plans of Sigma , a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction . With the transition to more advanced gaming hardware , series artist Keiji Inafune explained that the development of Mega Man X involved reinventing Mega Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built . Much like the NES Mega Man games that came before it , Mega Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight , initial stages in any order desired . Defeating the boss character at the end of each stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game . However , Mega Man X adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series . These include allowing the player to dash along the ground , scale walls , and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities",
