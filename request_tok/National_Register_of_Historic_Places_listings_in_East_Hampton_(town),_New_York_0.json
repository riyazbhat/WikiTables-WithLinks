  "/wiki/AN/FPS-35_Radar_Tower_and_Antenna": "The AN/FPS-35 radar was a long range radar used in the early 1960s . It was one of the largest air defense radars ever produced , with its antenna and supporting structure mounted on one of the largest rolling-element bearings in the world ( with a ball pitch of 12 ft 7 inches in diameter. ) . Sperry Corporation built 12 long range radars ( picking up objects 200 miles away ) in the 1960s to succeed existing Semi Automatic Ground Environment ( SAGE ) to provide enhanced electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) . The systems operated at 420 to 450 MHz . The antennas weighed 70 to 80 short tons ( 64 to 73 t ) and had numerous problems . The concrete tower bases were 84 feet 6 inches ( 25.76 m ) high and 60 feet 3 inches ( 18.36 m ) square in side dimensions . The prototype was developed at the Thomasville Aircraft Control and Warning Station in Thomasville , Alabama . All of the radars have been dismantled except for the one at Camp Hero on the eastern tip of Long Island , New York . Fishermen on the Atlantic Ocean and Block Island Sound lobbied to save it since the massive radar tower was a better daytime landmark than the Montauk Point Lighthouse . The radar complex is now part of Camp Hero State Park which adjoins Montauk Point State Park . The radar has worked its way into an urban legend that it was used in time travel experiments called the Montauk Project . The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 .",
