In contrast to several other file managers , it has a context aware user interface hiding complexity - for instance , the bottom function list changes on press of modifier keys , just showing the currently available hotkey function set . Its development was started in 1996 as a hobby project by Petr \u0160ol\u00edn ( from Czech Republic ) during his studies at university and released as freeware in 1997 . It was originally written in Watcom C++ , later in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 . The first shareware version 2.0 was released in 2001 by a newly established company Altap . Salamander 2.0 included support for viewer and archiver plugins . During the development of 2.5 version the plugin architecture was expanded to support file system plugins to support FTP and other protocols . The plugin SDK for 2.5 version allows plugin developers to create new viewer plugins ( for file previews ) , archiver plugins ( for browsing/unpacking/packing archives ) , file system plugins ( for custom directory listing ) and tools ( like multi-rename or file compare ) . Custom column plugins known from Total Commander are not supported , neither yet non-latin alphabets of the Unicode . The version 3 series newly supports the MS Windows 7 and higher , two binaries are available , for users ' choice : 32-bit and 64-bit . Starting with version 4.0 , Salamander has become freeware again , however active development has been indefinitely suspended as of July 2019 .",

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

Within Australia , it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ( $ ) , with A $ or AU $ sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies . The $ symbol precedes the amount . It is subdivided into 100 cents . The Australian dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966 to replace the pre-decimal Australian pound , with the conversion rate of A $ 2 per = A\u20a41 . The Australian dollar was legal tender of Papua New Guinea until 31 December 1975 , when the Papua New Guinean kina became sole legal tender , and of the Solomon Islands until 1977 , when the Solomon Islands dollar became sole legal tender . In 2016 , the Australian dollar was the fifth most traded currency in world foreign exchange markets , accounting for 6.9 % of the world 's daily share ( down from 8.6 % in 2013 ) behind the United States dollar , the European Union 's euro , the Japanese yen and the United Kingdom 's pound sterling . The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders , because of the comparatively high interest rates in Australia , the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from government intervention , the general stability of Australia 's economy and political system , and the prevailing view that the Australian dollar offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies , especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle .

  "/wiki/Dired": "Dired ( for Directory Editor ) is a computer program for editing file system directories . It typically runs inside the Emacs text editor as a specialized mode , though standalone versions have been written . Dired was the first file manager , or visual editor of file system information . [ discuss ] The first version of Dired was written as a stand-alone program circa 1974 by Stan Kugell at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( SAIL ) . It was incorporated into GNU Emacs from the earliest versions , and re-implemented in C and C++ on other operating systems . When run in Emacs , dired displays an ls-like file listing in an Emacs buffer . The list can be navigated using standard navigation commands . Several Emacs Lisp scripts have been developed to extend Dired in Emacs . In combination with Tramp it is able to access remote file systems for editing files by means of SSH , FTP , telnet and many other protocols , as well as the capability of accessing local files as another user in the same session . There are also functions that make it possible to rename multiple files via Emacs search and replace capabilities or apply regular expressions for marking ( selecting ) multiple files . Once marked , files can be operated on in various ways from deleting , to renaming , to executing an external shell command or elisp function on them . By means of the Lisp package dired-x it is also possible to handle existing ls-like directory listings in a virtual Dired mode .",
  "/wiki/Emacs": "Emacs /\u02c8i\u02d0m\u00e6ks/ or EMACS ( Editor MACroS ) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility . The manual for the most widely used variant , GNU Emacs , describes it as the extensible , customizable , self-documenting , real-time display editor . Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s , and work on its direct descendant , GNU Emacs , continues actively as of 2020 [ update ] . Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its user interface allows the user to combine these commands into macros to automate work . Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the Lisp programming language that provides a deep extension capability , allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor . Extensions have been written to manage email , files , outlines , and RSS feeds , as well as clones of ELIZA , Pong , Conway 's Life , Snake and Tetris . The original EMACS was written in 1976 by Carl Mikkelsen , David A . Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of Editor MACroS for the TECO editor . It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS . The most popular , and most ported , version of Emacs is GNU Emacs , which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project . XEmacs is a variant that branched from GNU Emacs in 1991 . GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other .",
  "/wiki/GNU_project": "The GNU Project ( /\u0261nu\u02d0/ ( listen ) ) is a free software , mass collaboration project that Richard Stallman announced on September 27 , 1983 . Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software , copy and distribute it , study it , and modify it . GNU software grants these rights in its license . In order to ensure that the entire software of a computer grants its users all freedom rights ( use , share , study , modify ) , even the most fundamental and important part , the operating system ( including all its numerous utility programs ) needed to be free software . According to its manifesto , the founding goal of the project was to build a free operating system , and if possible , everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free . Stallman decided to call this operating system GNU ( a recursive acronym meaning GNU 's not Unix ! ) , basing its design on that of Unix , a proprietary operating system . Development was initiated in January 1984 . In 1991 , the Linux kernel appeared , developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds , and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License . Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project , it allowed for the first operating system that was free software , commonly known as Linux . The project 's current work includes software development , awareness building , political campaigning and sharing of the new material .",
  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources .
