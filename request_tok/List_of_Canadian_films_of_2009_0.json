  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",

Heuer , a biologist and author , had written a book on his experiences making the documentary Being Caribou , in which he and Allison traveled 1500 km by foot across Arctic tundra following a herd of 120,000 Porcupine caribou . After reading a draft of Heuer 's account , Mowat invited them to visit him at his summer farm in Cape Breton Island . Accompanied by their two-year-old son Zev and dog Willow , the couple left their home in Canmore in May 2007 for a 5000 kilometre , six-month trek east across Canada . From Canmore , Alberta , 100 kilometres west of Calgary , they canoed to Hudson Bay , visiting many of the settings Mowat wrote about in Never Cry Wolf , Lost in the Barrens and People of the Deer . From Hudson Bay , their plan was to travel by sea to northern Labrador , the setting of Mowat stories such as The Serpent 's Coil , Grey Seas Under , Sea of Slaughter and A Whale for the Killing .

  "/wiki/Farley_Mowat": "Farley McGill Mowat , OC ( May 12 , 1921 - May 6 , 2014 ) was a Canadian writer and environmentalist . His works were translated into 52 languages , and he sold more than 17 million books . He achieved fame with the publication of his books on the Canadian north , such as People of the Deer ( 1952 ) and Never Cry Wolf ( 1963 ) . The latter , an account of his experiences with wolves in the Arctic , was made into a film of the same name released in 1983 . For his body of work as a writer he won the annual Vicky Metcalf Award for Children 's Literature in 1970 . Mowat 's advocacy for environmental causes earned him praise , but his admission , after some of his books ' claims had been debunked , that he never let the facts get in the way of the truth earned harsh criticism : few readers remain neutral . Descriptions of Mowat refer to his commitment to ideals and poetic descriptions and vivid images as well as his strong antipathies , which provoke ridicule , lampoons and , at times , evangelical condemnation ."
