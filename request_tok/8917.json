It is the largest hot desert in the world , and the third largest desert overall after Antarctica and the Arctic . Its area of 9,200,000 square kilometres ( 3,600,000 sq mi ) is comparable to the area of China or the United States . The name 'Sahara ' is derived from a dialectal Arabic word for desert , \u1e63a\u1e25ra ( \u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627 /\u02c8s\u02e4a\u0127ra/ ) . The desert comprises much of North Africa , excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast , the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb , and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan . It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west , where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains . To the south , it is bounded by the Sahel , a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa . The Sahara can be divided into several regions including : the western Sahara , the central Ahaggar Mountains , the Tibesti Mountains , the A\u00efr Mountains , the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 desert , and the Libyan Desert . For several hundred thousand years , the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000 year cycle caused by the precession of the Earth 's axis as it rotates around the Sun , which changes the location of the North African Monsoon . The area is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years ( 17,000 AD ) .",
