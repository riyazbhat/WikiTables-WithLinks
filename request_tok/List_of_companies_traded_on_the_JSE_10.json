  "/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)": "Ventilation is the intentional introduction of outdoor air into a space . Ventilation is mainly used to control indoor air quality by diluting and displacing indoor pollutants ; it can also be used to control indoor temperature , humidity , and air motion to benefit thermal comfort , satisfaction with other aspects of indoor environment , or other objectives . The intentional introduction of outdoor air is usually categorized as either mechanical ventilation , natural ventilation , or mixed-mode ventilation ( hybrid ventilation )",
  "/wiki/Brick": "A brick is building material used to make walls , pavements and other elements in masonry construction . Traditionally , the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil , sand , and lime , or concrete materials . Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them . Bricks are produced in numerous classes , types , materials , and sizes which vary with region and time period , and are produced in bulk quantities . Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks . Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials , but is usually larger than a brick . Lightweight bricks ( also called lightweight blocks ) are made from expanded clay aggregate . Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials , sometimes referred to as artificial stone , and have been used since circa 4000 BC . Air-dried bricks , also known as mudbricks , have a history older than fired bricks , and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw . Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds , collectively known as brickwork , and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure",
  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40 % of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25 % of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth",

  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80 % of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80 % or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name",
  "/wiki/Meat": "Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food . Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times . The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens , sheep , rabbits , pigs and cattle . This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses . Meat is mainly composed of water , protein , and fat . It is edible raw , but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways . Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi . Meat is important in economy and culture , even though its mass production and consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the environment . Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be eaten . Vegetarians and vegans may abstain from eating meat because of concerns about the ethics of eating meat , environmental effects of meat production or nutritional effects of consumption",

  "/wiki/Plastic": "Plastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects . Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but , in the class of moldable polymers , this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability . Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances . They are usually synthetic , most commonly derived from petrochemicals , however , an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters . Due to their low cost , ease of manufacture , versatility , and imperviousness to water , plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale , including paper clips and spacecraft . They have prevailed over traditional materials , such as wood , stone , horn and bone , leather , metal , glass , and ceramic , in some products previously left to natural materials . In developed economies , about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping , plumbing or vinyl siding . Other uses include automobiles ( up to 20 % plastic ) , furniture , and toys . In the developing world , the applications of plastic may differ - 42 % of India 's consumption is used in packaging . Worldwide , about 50 kg of plastic is produced annually per person , with production doubling every ten years . Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well , with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic . The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials , but rather the meaning of the word plasticity , with regard to the reshaping of flesh",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20 % and 60 % quartz by volume , and at least 35 % of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite",

  "/wiki/Pub": "A pub , or public house , is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks , which traditionally include beer ( such as ale ) and cider . It is a social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British , Irish , Breton , New Zealand , Canadian , South African and Australian cultures . In many places , especially in villages , a pub is the focal point of the community . In his 17th-century diary , Samuel Pepys described the pub as the heart of England . Pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns , through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the development of the tied house system in the 19th century . In 1393 , King Richard II of England introduced legislation that pubs had to display a sign outdoors to make them easily visible for passing ale tasters , who would assess the quality of ale sold . Most pubs focus on offering beers , ales and similar drinks . As well , pubs often sell wines , spirits , and soft drinks , meals and snacks . The owner , tenant or manager ( licensee ) is known as the pub landlord or landlady , or publican . Referred to as their local by regulars , pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work , the availability of a particular beer or ale or a good selection , good food , a social atmosphere , the presence of friends and acquaintances , and the availability of recreational activities such as a darts team , a skittles team , and a pool or snooker table . The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s",
  "/wiki/Fast_food": "Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on speed of service versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science . Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters , travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal . By making speed of service the priority , this ensured that customers with strictly limited time ( a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family , for example , or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break ) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot ( as is expected from a traditional sit down restaurant ) . For those with no time to spare , fast food became a multibillion-dollar industry . In 2018 , the fast food industry was worth an estimated $ 570 billion globally . The fastest form of fast food consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer 's arrival ( Boston Market rotisserie chicken , Little Caesars pizza , etc . ) , with waiting time reduced to mere seconds . Other fast food outlets , primarily the hamburger outlets ( McDonald 's , Burger King , etc . ) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients ( bagged buns & condiments , frozen beef patties , prewashed/sliced vegetables , etc . ) but take great pains to point out to the customer that the meat and potatoes ( hamburgers and french fries ) are always cooked fresh ( or at least relatively recently ) and assembled to order ( like at a diner ) . Although a vast variety of food can be cooked fast , fast food is a commercial term limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen , preheated or precooked ingredients , and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away . Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through",
  "/wiki/Franchising": "Franchising is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organization as a strategy for business expansion . Where implemented , a franchisor licenses its know-how , procedures , intellectual property , use of its business model , brand , and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee . In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations , typically set out in a Franchise Agreement . The word franchise is of Anglo-French derivation - from franc , meaning free - and is used both as a noun and as a ( transitive ) verb . For the franchisor , use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy , compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or chain stores . Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchisor 's capital investment and liability risk . Franchising is not an equal partnership , especially due to the preponderance of the franchisor over the franchisee . But under specific circumstances like transparency , favourable legal conditions , financial means and proper market research , franchising can be a vehicle of success for both franchisor and franchisee . Thirty-six countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising , with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising . Franchising is also used as a foreign market entry mode",

Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite ( greater than about 60 % iron ) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore , meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces . Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron , which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98 % of the mined iron ore is used to make steel . Indeed , it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity , except perhaps oil",

  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry"
