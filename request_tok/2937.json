He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia . After founding the Empire and being proclaimed Genghis Khan , he launched the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia . Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include those against the Qara Khitai , Caucasus , and Khwarazmian , Western Xia and Jin dynasties . These campaigns were often accompanied by large-scale massacres of the civilian populations , especially in the Khwarazmian- and Western Xia-controlled lands . By the end of his life , the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China . Before Genghis Khan died he assigned \u00d6gedei Khan as his successor . Later his grandsons split his empire into khanates . Genghis Khan died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia . By his request , his body was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia . His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states in all of modern-day China , Korea , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and substantial portions of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia .

The city was taken by Alexander the Great in 329 BC , when it was known by its Greek name of Marakanda ( \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 ) . The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and Turkic rulers until the Mongols under Genghis Khan conquered Samarkand in 1220 . Today , Samarkand is the capital of Samarqand Region and one of the largest cities of Uzbekistan . The city is noted for being an Islamic center for scholarly study . In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of Timur ( Tamerlane ) and is the site of his mausoleum ( the Gur-e Amir ) .

  "/wiki/Soviet\u2013Afghan_War": "The Soviet-Afghan War was a conflict wherein insurgent groups known collectively as the mujahideen , as well as smaller Maoist groups , fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet Army and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan government . It was fought over nine years , from December 1979 to February 1989 , mostly in the Afghan countryside . The mujahideen groups were backed primarily by the United States , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan , making it a Cold War proxy war . Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 civilians were killed and millions of Afghans fled the country as refugees , mostly to Pakistan and Iran . The war derives from a 1978 coup when Afghanistan 's communist party took power , initiating a series of radical modernization reforms throughout the country . These reforms were deeply unpopular among the more traditional rural population and established power structures . [ page needed ] The repressive nature of Soviet Afghanistan , which vigorously suppressed opposition including the execution of thousands of political prisoners , led to the rise of anti-government armed groups and by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion . The ruling party itself experienced deep rivalries , and in September 1979 the President , Nur Mohammad Taraki , was murdered under orders of the second-in-command , Hafizullah Amin , which soured relations with the Soviet Union . Eventually the Soviet government , under leader Leonid Brezhnev , decided to deploy the 40th Army on December 24 , 1979 . Arriving in the capital Kabul , they staged a coup , killing president Amin and installing Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal from a rival faction . The deployment had been variously called an invasion ( by Western media and the rebels ) or a legitimate supporting intervention ( by the Soviet Union and the Afghan government ) on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine . In January 1980 , foreign ministers from 34 nations of the Islamic Conference adopted a resolution demanding the immediate , urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan .",
