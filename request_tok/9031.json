  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Erie": "Lake Erie /\u02c8\u026a\u0259ri/ ( French : Lac \u00c9ri\u00e9 ) is the fourth-largest lake ( by surface area ) of the five Great Lakes in North America , and the eleventh-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area . It is the southernmost , shallowest , and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time . At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet ( 64 metres ) deep . Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States , Lake Erie 's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario , specifically the Ontario Peninsula , with the U.S. states of Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York on its western , southern , and eastern shores . These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries . The lake was named by the Erie people , a Native American people who lived along its southern shore . The tribal name erie is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word erielhonan , meaning long tail . Situated below Lake Huron , Erie 's primary inlet is the Detroit River . The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River , which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston , New York and Queenston , Ontario . Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal , part of the St. Lawrence Seaway , which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne , Ontario on Lake Erie , to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario , an elevation difference of 326 ft ( 99 m ) . Lake Erie 's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades , with issues such as overfishing , pollution , algae blooms , and eutrophication generating headlines .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Ontario": "Lake Ontario is one of the five Great Lakes of North America . It is surrounded on the north , west , and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario , and on the south and east by the American state of New York , whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake . Ontario , Canada 's most populous province , was named for the lake . Many of Ontario 's most populous cities , including Toronto , Canada 's most populous city , and Hamilton , are on the lake 's northern and western shores respectively . In the Huron language , the name Ontar\u00ed'io means great lake . Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie . The last in the Great Lakes chain , Lake Ontario serves as the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River . It is the only Great Lake not to border the state of Michigan .",
  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",

The phrase La Grande \u00cele appears on the town seal . Over its history , Grand Island has served as home to the Attawandaron Nation and been an acquisition of both French and English colonial pursuits . In 1945 , Grand Island was part of a plan to make a new World Peace Capital on the international border between Southern Ontario , Canada , and Western New York . The plan proposed placing the United Nations headquarters on adjacent Navy Island ( Ontario ) , which was considered an ideal location because it lay on the boundary between two peaceful countries . An artist 's rendering of the World Peace Capital showed the property with bridges spanning both countries ( between Grand Island in the United States and the Canadian mainland ) . The proposal was turned down in favor of the current U.N. headquarters in New York City .
