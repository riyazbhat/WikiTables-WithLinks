  "/wiki/Passenger_Pigeons": "The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius ) is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America . Its common name is derived from the French word passager , meaning passing by , due to the migratory habits of the species . The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics . The morphologically similar mourning dove ( Zenaida macroura ) was long thought to be its closest relative , and the two were at times confused , but genetic analysis has shown that the genus Patagioenas is more closely related to it than the Zenaida doves . The passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic in size and coloration . The male was 390 to 410 mm ( 15.4 to 16.1 in ) in length , mainly gray on the upperparts , lighter on the underparts , with iridescent bronze feathers on the neck , and black spots on the wings . The female was 380 to 400 mm ( 15.0 to 15.7 in ) , and was duller and browner than the male overall . The juvenile was similar to the female , but without iridescence . It mainly inhabited the deciduous forests of eastern North America and was also recorded elsewhere , but bred primarily around the Great Lakes . The pigeon migrated in enormous flocks , constantly searching for food , shelter , and breeding grounds , and was once the most abundant bird in North America , numbering around 3 billion , and possibly up to 5 billion . A very fast flyer , the passenger pigeon could reach a speed of 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) . The bird fed mainly on mast , and also fruits and invertebrates .",
