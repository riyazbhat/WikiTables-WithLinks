He also completed the 'distance double ' at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships in Athletics . He was the second man in history , after Kenenisa Bekele , to win long-distance doubles at successive Olympics and World Championships , and the first in history to defend both distance titles in both major global competitions - a feat described as the 'quadruple-double ' . Since finishing 2nd in the 10,000 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics , Farah had an unbroken streak of ten global final wins ( the 5000m in 2011 , the 10,000m in 2017 and the double in 2012 , 2013 , 2015 and 2016 ) . The streak ended in Farah 's final championship track race , when he finished second to Ethiopia 's Muktar Edris in the 2017 5000 metres final . In his final track race , the 2017 Diamond League Final in Zurich in August 2017 , Farah gained his revenge , edging out world champion Edris to win his only IAAF Diamond League title at 5000 metres . On the track , he mostly competed over 5000 metres and 10,000 metres , but has run competitively from 1500 metres to the marathon . In 2017 he indicated his intention to switch wholly to road racing following victory at his final track race , the 2017 IAAF Diamond League 5000 metres final . His running style has been described as bouncy and tactical , which he has attempted to alter for a more efficient and energy-saving stride pattern , especially in the longer distances . Farah runs distance races tactically , a style which is aided by his quick sprint finish . Born in Mogadishu , Somalia , to an Isaaq Somali family from Gabiley , Somaliland , Farah went on to be based in London and ran for Newham and Essex Beagles athletics club , training at St Mary 's University College , Twickenham from 2001 to 2011 .",

The event was held at the Olympic Stadium on 4 August . The race was won by Mo Farah , the reigning 5000 metres World Champion , in a time of 27:30.42 . From the beginning Farah stayed close to the race leaders , who on the first lap were the defending champion Kenenisa Bekele and his brother Tariku . After six laps , the half marathon world record holder Zersenay Tadese and his Eritrean teammates began to push the pace . At the same time , Moses Kipsiro went down , causing the field to scatter and Farah to fall back in the field with his American training partner Galen Rupp . When Tariku Bekele came up behind Tadese , his attempt to force the pace slowed . The 5000 metre mark was reached in 14:05.79 , with Tadesse in front , though Bedan Karoki Muchiri took the lead soon after . Thirteen runners remained in the lead pack including three Ethiopians , three Eritreans , two Kenyans , Kipsiro , Kenyan born Polat Kemboi Arikan running for Turkey , Canadian Cameron Levins , Farah and Rupp . Strategic play continued as Tariku elbowed Farah , causing him to step to the outside ready to cover a move . Then the third Ethiopian Gebregziabher Gebremariam , ran to the front , but rather than forcing the pace , he seemed to slow it down . With two laps to go , Tariku Bekele regained the lead , with Farah on his shoulder and Moses Ndiema Masai , Rupp and Michuri following in close formation .",

The north-west corner of the town , bordering on Osterley to the north and Lampton to the west , is known as 'Spring Grove ' . Isleworth 's former Thames frontage of approximately one mile , excluding that of the Syon Park estate , was reduced to little over half a mile in 1994 when a borough boundary realignment was effected in order to unite the district of St Margaret 's wholly within London Borough of Richmond upon Thames . As a result , most of Isleworth 's riverside is that part overlooking the 8.6-acre ( 3.5 ha ) islet of Isleworth Ait : the short-length River Crane flows into the Thames south of the Isleworth Ait , and its artificial distributary the Duke of Northumberland 's River west of the Isleworth Ait , one of two Colne distributaries constructed for aesthetic reasons in the 1600-1750 period .",

Team sprint , team pursuit and keirin were added to the women 's programme , while Omnium was a new race for both men and women . Countries were restricted to one entry per track event , a restriction which seemed to be directed at preventing the British team from double-medalling in the same event as they had in four events in 2008 , thus lowering their medal chances .

It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 .
