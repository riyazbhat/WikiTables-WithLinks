  "intro": "Cho Kwang-rae (, born March 19, 1954) is a former South Korean football player and manager. He is the current executive director of Daegu FC. Cho is regarded as one of the greatest South Korean central midfielders of all time. He was nicknamed the Computer Linker because of his accurate passing, wide vision and intelligent decision. Cho spent his club career in Yonsei University, Pohang Steelworks, Army FC and Daewoo Royals. Cho was selected for the national university team for the 1976 World University Football Championship in Uruguay. South Korea advanced to the final by defeating Brazil, Chile and the Netherlands in the championship. He led team's title by inducing crucial penalty kick against Paraguay in the final. In the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Cho contributed team's draw by providing an assist against Bulgaria, but he scored a fatal own goal and team lost 2-3 against Italy. Cho also played for the national team for the 1986 Asian Games and consecutively scored team's first goals in the semi-finals and the final. South Korea won a gold medal in the tournament and Cho selected the final match (vs. Saudi Arabia) as the best match in his international career."
