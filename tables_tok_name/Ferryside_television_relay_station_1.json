  "section_text": "The Ferryside `` digital switchover '' trial commenced with four of the pre-DSO multiplexes from Preseli being re-radiated in the gaps between the existing analogue TV channels . The BBC multiplexes were trialled with the ultra-low ERP of 1 W , the COM multiplexes with 5 W .",

  "intro": "Ferryside television relay station is a small TV relay in the village of Ferryside, Carmarthenshire, Wales (grid reference SN371104). The Ferryside relay is fed with the off-air signal from Preseli about 28 km to the northwest. It is one of the few UK broadcasting transmitters using a wooden pole as aerial tower. It was built in 1985 partly to provide a stronger signal to Ferryside itself, but also to lower Llansteffan on the western side of the estuary which could not receive a usable signal either from Preseli nor from Carmel about 22 km to the northeast."
