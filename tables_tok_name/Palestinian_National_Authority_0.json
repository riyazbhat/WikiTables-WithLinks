They are in charge of the Palestinian police force in their jurisdiction as well as coordinating state services such as education , health and transportation . The governorates are under the direct supervision of the Interior Ministry . [ 117 ] The governorates in the West Bank are grouped into three areas per the Oslo II Accord . Area A forms 18% of the West Bank by area , and is administered by the Palestinian Authority . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Area B forms 22% of the West Bank , and is under Palestinian civil control , and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control .

  "intro": "The Palestinian National Authority (PA or PNA; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 as-Sul\u1e6da al-Wa\u1e6dan\u012bya al-Filas\u1e6d\u012bn\u012bya) is the interim self-government body established in 1994 following the Gaza-Jericho Agreement to govern the Gaza Strip and Areas A and B of the West Bank, as a consequence of the 1993 Oslo Accords. Following elections in 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties, its authority had extended only in areas A and B of the West Bank. Since January 2013, the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority uses the name State of Palestine on official documents. The Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, pursuant to the Oslo Accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the government of Israel, as a five-year interim body. Further negotiations were then meant to take place between the two parties regarding its final status. According to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority was designated to have exclusive control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as Area A) and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas (Area B). The remainder of the territories, including Israeli settlements, the Jordan Valley region and bypass roads between Palestinian communities, were to remain under Israeli control (Area C). East Jerusalem was excluded from the Accords. Negotiations with several Israeli governments had resulted in the Authority gaining further control of some areas, but control was then lost in some areas when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retook several strategic positions during the Second (Al-Aqsa) Intifada. In 2005, after the Second Intifada, Israel withdrew unilaterally from its settlements in the Gaza Strip, thereby expanding Palestinian Authority control to the entire strip while Israel continued to control the crossing points, airspace, and the waters off the Gaza Strip's coast. In the Palestinian legislative elections on 25 January 2006, Hamas emerged victorious and nominated Ismail Haniyeh as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip."
