  "intro": "Melissa Suzanne George (born 6 August 1976) is an Australian-American actress and entrepreneur. A former national rollerskating champion and model, George began her acting career playing Angel Parrish on the Australian soap opera Home and Away (1993-96). After moving to the United States, George made her big-screen debut in 1998 in the neo-noir/science fiction film Dark City. She later appeared in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey (1999), David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001), Sugar & Spice (2001), and Down with Love (2003). In 2005, George transitioned into leading roles when she played Kathy Lutz in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She followed this with a succession of films in the thriller and horror genres, such as Derailed (2005), Turistas (2006), W\u0394Z (2007), 30 Days of Night (2007), Triangle (2009), A Lonely Place to Die (2011), and Felony (2013). On television, George has had recurring roles on Alias (2003-04), Grey's Anatomy (2008-09) and The Good Wife (2013-14), and a leading role on the NBC medical drama Heartbeat (2016). She received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Laura Hill on HBO's In Treatment (2008). She also starred in the Australian miniseries The Slap (2011), for which she received a Logie Award, and the BBC spy series Hunted (2012). In 2015, she appeared in the American adaptation of The Slap, playing the same character, Rosie, that she played in the previous version. She currently stars as Diane Hagerty on Hulu's The First (2018)."
