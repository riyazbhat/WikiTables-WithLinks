  "section_text": "Main articles : Photovoltaic power station and List of photovoltaic power stations The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW power plant in Riverside County , California , that uses thin-film CdTe solar modules made by First Solar . [ 45 ] As of November 2014 , the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world . This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex . The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is Longyangxia Dam Solar Park , in Gonghe County , Qinghai , China .",

  "intro": "Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale photovoltaic power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the Pavagada Solar Park, Karnataka, India with a generation capacity of 2050 MW. The International Energy Agency projected in 2014 that under its high renewables scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the worldwide electricity consumption, and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in China and India. In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing 35% from the previous year. As of 2018, the unsubsidised levelised cost of electricity for utility-scale solar power is around $43/MWh."
