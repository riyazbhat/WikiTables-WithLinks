  "intro": "The 2009-10 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n season (known as the Liga Adelante for sponsorship reasons) was the 79th since its establishment. The first matches of the season were played on 29 August 2009, and the season ended on 19 June 2010. Real Betis, Numancia and Recreativo de Huelva are the teams which were relegated from La Liga the previous season. The teams which were promoted from Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B were: C\u00e1diz (champion), Cartagena (runner-up), Real Uni\u00f3n (play-off winner) and Villarreal B (play-off winner). The first goal of the season was scored by Quique de Lucas, who scored a seventh-minute goal for Cartagena against Girona in the early kick-off. The first red card of the season was given to David Gonz\u00e1lez from Las Palmas in their opening game against Real Sociedad. The first hat-trick was scored by Cristhian Stuani in the match between Castell\u00f3n and Albacete."
