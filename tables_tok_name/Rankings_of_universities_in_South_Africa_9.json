  "intro": "Rankings of universities in South Africa are largely based on international university rankings, since there are no South African rankings as of yet. These international university rankings indicate that South Africa's university system is the strongest on the continent: it is home to five of the six highest ranked African universities, including the two campuses consistently ranked as academically strongest in Africa, University of Cape Town and University of the Witwatersrand, which are situated in South Africa's two most prominent cities (Cape Town and Johannesburg, respectively)."
