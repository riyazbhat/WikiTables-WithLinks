  "section_text": "A press conference with Paul , 6 July 2010 Paul 's accurate choices for the 2010 World Cup , broadcast live by German news channel n-tv , endowed him with celebrity status . [ 3 ] Paul predicted the winners of each of the seven 2010 FIFA World Cup matches that the German team played , against Australia , Serbia , Ghana , England , Argentina , Spain , [ 21 ] and Uruguay . His prediction that Argentina would lose prompted Argentine chef Nicolas Bedorrou to post an octopus recipe on Facebook .

He will survive . \u2014 Oliver Walenciak ( Paul 's keeper ) [ 22 ] Paul correctly predicted the outcome of the semi-final , by choosing the food in the box marked with the Spanish flag . German supporters drew hope from his incorrect choice for the Germany versus Spain match in the UEFA Euro 2008 but were disappointed . [ 23 ] The prediction led to German fans calling for Paul to be eaten . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In response , the Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero offered to send Paul official state protection , and the Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian called for Paul to be given safe haven in Spain . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Paul 's notoriety attracted criticism from the President of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who accused him of being a symbol of Western decadence and decay . [ 28 ] Doubts were expressed as to whether it was actually the same octopus in 2010 as it had been in 2008 . [ 29 ]",

  "intro": "Paul the Octopus (26 January 2008 - 26 October 2010) was a common octopus used to predict the results of association football matches. Accurate predictions in the 2010 World Cup brought him worldwide attention as an animal oracle. During divinations, Paul's keepers would present him with two boxes containing food. The boxes were identical except that they were decorated with the different team flags of the competitors in an upcoming football match. Whichever box Paul ate from first was considered his prediction for which team would win the match. His keepers at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany, mainly tasked him with predicting the outcomes of international matches in which the German national football team was playing. Paul correctly chose the winning team in four of Germany's six Euro 2008 matches, and all seven of their matches in the 2010 World Cup - including Germany's third place play-off win over Uruguay on 10 July. He also correctly chose Spain as the winner of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. In all, Paul amassed an overall record of 12 correct predictions out of 14: a success rate of approximately 85.7%."
