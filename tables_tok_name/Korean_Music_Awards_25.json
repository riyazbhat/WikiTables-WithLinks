  "intro": "The Korean Music Awards is an annual South Korean music awards show that honors both mainstream and underground musical artists from a variety of genres. Unlike other major South Korean music awards, which largely rely on record sales to determine winners, the Korean Music Awards distributes awards based on the recommendations of a panel of judges consisting of music critics, radio show producers, academics, and other professionals within the industry. The first Korean Music Awards was held in 2004."
