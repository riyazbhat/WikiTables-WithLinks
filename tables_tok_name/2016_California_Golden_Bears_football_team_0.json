  "intro": "The 2016 California Golden Bears football team represented the University of California, Berkeley in the 2016 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Bears were led by fourth-year head coach Sonny Dykes and played their home games at Memorial Stadium. Shortly after the conclusion of the 2015 season, Dykes stated that he did not anticipate any staff turnover. However, offensive coordinator Tony Franklin resigned from his position at California a few weeks after Dykes made this statement. Franklin left to take up the same position at Middle Tennessee State, citing a desire to move closer to his family in Kentucky. Dykes replaced Franklin with Jake Spavital, who had recently been fired by Texas A&M University. Like Dykes, Spavital was from Mike Leach's Air Raid coaching tree. An additional signing from that lineage was the transfer of quarterback Davis Webb from Texas Tech; Webb completed his bachelor's degree in three years transferring to Cal for his final year of eligibility as a graduate student. In 2016, Cal went 5-7, winning only 3 out of the 9 Pac-12 games. Dykes once again lost to Stanford at home by two touchdowns and to USC in Los Angeles by three touchdowns. His team also lost to San Diego State of the Mountain West Conference. Highlights of that season were Cal's second straight beating of then No."
