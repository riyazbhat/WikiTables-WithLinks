  "section_title": "American football -- Close to perfect",
  "section_text": "Since the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in 1961 , eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties ( or better ) while failing to achieve a perfect season :",
  "uid": "Perfect_season_2",
  "intro": "A perfect season is a sports season including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A perfect regular season (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season excluding any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional. A perfect season may be part of a multi-season winning streak. Exhibition games are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason (exhibition games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season."
