  "intro": "The United States was the host nation for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. These Games were by far the best home Winter Games for the United States, earning 34 total medals, nearly triple their best previous hauls at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, and the 1932 Winter Olympics and 1980 Winter Olympics, both in Lake Placid, New York and the most a host country has won at a single Winter Olympics. The United States also tied Norway at the 1994 Winter Olympics for most gold medals a host country has won at a Winter Olympics, with 10. Canada broke this record during the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Olympics were held only months after September 11, 2001. During the opening ceremonies, Jacques Rogge, presiding over his first Olympics as IOC president, told the American athletes that the world was gathered in their country and that their country was overcoming the horrific tragedy of that day and stands united with them in promoting the IOC's ideals."
