  "intro": "The 2005 AFL draft was the 2005 instance of the AFL draft, the annual draft of talented players by Australian rules football teams that participate in the main competition of that sport, the Australian Football League.The 2005 draft consisted of a pre-season draft, a national draft, a trade period and a rookie elevation. In 2005 there were 76 picks to be drafted amongst 16 teams in the national draft. The Carlton Blues received the first pick in the national draft after finishing on the bottom of the ladder during the 2005 AFL season. This was their first ever priority draft pick after the drama of 2002 when they lost draft picks for breaching the salary cap. In addition to the national draft, the 2005/06 off-season featured trade week (prior to the national draft) and pre-season and rookie drafts (following the national draft)."
