  "section_text": "Located in Nags Head is the largest sand dune on the East Coast at Jockey 's Ridge State Park . [ 12 ] The sand dune has migrated over the years from the energy of coastal winds and has buried a miniature golf course along the way . Jockey 's Ridge has been popular with hang-gliders since the advent of the sport , as well as kite flyers . The park 's visitor center includes an informative museum with exhibits on sand , weather , and local fauna . The diversity of wildlife may change with seasonal migrations and includes bird species , foxes , mice , squirrels , occasional deer and rabbits . One of the most exciting features of the Ridge is its capriciousness . Annual visitors find that ephemeral pools can spring up , and the sand can shift , making for a fresh experience every time . From the top of the Ridge , the ocean as well as the sound can be seen . Jockey 's Ridge has a sound beach on the Roanoke Sound side where visitors may swim . The Nags Head Woods Ecological Preserve is 1,092 acres ( 4.42 km2 ) and lies North of Jockey 's Ridge and east of Roanoke Sound . It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974 . [ 13 ] As in any other beach town , the ocean and shoreline are the major attractions , providing beaches for swimming , sunbathing , and a variety of water sports . A series of historic cottages overlook the beach in sections . There are three piers popular for fishing : Nags Head Pier , Jennette 's Pier ( severely damaged by Hurricane Isabel in 2003 , bought and renovated by the North Carolina Aquariums , reopened in May 2011 ) , and Outer Banks Pier . The town also features miniature golf courses and small amusement centers with go-karts and bumper cars for family entertainment . Other attractions include various National Register of Historic Places in or near Nags Head , such as the following :",
