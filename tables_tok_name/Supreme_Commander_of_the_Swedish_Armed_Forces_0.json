  "intro": "The Supreme Commander (Swedish: \u00d6verbef\u00e4lhavaren; acronym: \u00d6B) is the highest ranked professional military officer in the Swedish Armed Forces, and is by NATO terminology the Swedish chief of defence equivalent. The Supreme Commander is the agency head of the Swedish Armed Forces and formally reports to the Government of Sweden, though normally through the Minister for Defence. [b] The primary responsibilities and duties of the Supreme Commander (and the charter for the Armed Forces) are prescribed in an ordinance issued by the Government. The Supreme Commander is, apart from the honorary ranks held by the King of Sweden and in the past other members of the Swedish Royal Family, by unwritten convention normally the only professional military officer on active duty to hold the highest rank (a four-star General or Admiral). An exception was made 2009-2014 when H\u00e5kan Syr\u00e9n was chairman of the European Union Military Committee. The present Supreme Commander, General Micael Byd\u00e9n, took office on 1 October 2015."
