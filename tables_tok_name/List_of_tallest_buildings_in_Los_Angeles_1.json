  "uid": "List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Los_Angeles_1",
  "intro": "The tallest building in Los Angeles is the Wilshire Grand Center, which became the tallest building in 2016. It is also the tallest building in the U.S. state of California. The Wilshire Grand Center also stands as the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, and the 11th-tallest building in the United States. Seven of the ten tallest buildings in California are located in Los Angeles. The 73-story U.S. Bank Tower, which rises 1,018 feet (310 m) in Downtown Los Angeles and was completed in 1989, is now the second-tallest building in Los Angeles. The history of skyscrapers in Los Angeles began with the 1903 completion of the Braly Building, which is often regarded as the first high-rise in the city; it rises 13 floors and 151 feet (46 m) in height. The building, originally constructed as a commercial structure, has since been renovated into a residential tower and is now known as the Continental Building. In 1904, Los Angeles imposed height restrictions throughout the city, prohibiting the construction of any building taller than 150 feet (46 m). An exception was made for the Los Angeles City Hall, built in 1928, which stands at 454 feet (138 m). This effectively limited the height of non-government buildings to 13 stories, and was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and over development at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957. Los Angeles (and especially Downtown) then went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time the city saw the completion of 23 of its 30 tallest buildings, including the U.S. Bank Tower, the Aon Center, and Two California Plaza."
