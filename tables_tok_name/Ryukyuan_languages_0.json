  "section_text": "The Ryukyuan languages belong to the Japonic language family , related to the Japanese language . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The Ryukyuan languages are not mutually intelligible with Japanese\u2014in fact , they are not even mutually intelligible with each other\u2014and thus are usually considered separate languages . [ 3 ] However , for socio-political and ideological reasons , they have often classified within Japan as dialects of Japanese . [ 3 ] Since the beginning of World War II , most mainland Japanese have regarded the Ryukyuan languages as a dialect or group of dialects of Japanese . During World War II , in an effort to build consciousness in people as subjects of the Japanese Empire , not only the Ryukyuan group , but also Korean , Palauan and various other languages were referred to as dialects of Japanese . [ 5 ] The Okinawan language is only 71% lexically similar to , or cognate with , standard Tokyo Japanese . Even the southernmost Japanese dialect ( Kagoshima dialect ) is only 72% cognate with the northernmost Ryukyuan language ( Amami ) . The Kagoshima dialect of Japanese , however , is 80% lexically similar to Standard Japanese . [ 6 ] There is general agreement among linguistics experts that Ryukyuan varieties can be divided into six languages , conservatively , [ 7 ] with dialects unique to islands within each group also sometimes considered languages . A widely accepted hypothesis among linguists categorizes the Ryukyuan languages into two groups , Northern Ryukyuan ( Amami\u2013Okinawa ) and Southern Ryukyuan ( Miyako\u2013Yaeyama ) . [ 4 ] [ 8 ] Many speakers of the Amami , Miyako , Yaeyama and Yonaguni languages may also be familiar with Okinawan since Okinawan has the most speakers and once acted as the regional standard . Speakers of Yonaguni are also likely to know the Yaeyama language due to its proximity . Since Amami , Miyako , Yaeyama , and Yonaguni are less urbanised than the Okinawan mainland , their languages are not declining as quickly as that of Okinawa proper , and some children continue to be brought up in these languages . In Okinawa proper , a dialect of standard Japanese known as Okinawan Japanese ( \u30a6\u30c1\u30ca\u30fc\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u30a5\u30b0\u30c1 , Uchin\u0101 Yamatuguchi ) has developed .

  "intro": "The Ryukyuan languages (\u7409\u7403\u8a9e\u6d3e, Ry\u016bky\u016b-goha, also \u7409\u7403\u8af8\u8a9e, Ry\u016bky\u016b-shogo or \u5cf6\u8a00\u8449, Shima kotoba, lit. Island Speech) are the indigenous languages of the Ryukyu Islands, the southernmost part of the Japanese archipelago. Along with the Japanese language, they make up the Japonic language family. The languages are not mutually intelligible with each other. It is not known how many speakers of these languages remain, but language shift towards the use of Standard Japanese and dialects like Okinawan Japanese has resulted in these languages becoming endangered; UNESCO labels four of the languages definitely endangered and two others severely endangered."
