  "intro": "The 2014 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship was the seventh edition of the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship. England hosted the final tournament from 26 November to 8 December 2013, taking it for the first time outside of Nyon, Switzerland. It was the first edition to feature eight finalist teams, and served as the qualifier for the 2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, to be held in March-April 2014. Portugal ensured their first presence in the competition's final tournament, after concluding the qualification as the best runner-up. They will join France, Germany and Spain, together with fellow debutants Austria, Italy and Scotland. Poland were the defending champions, having defeating Sweden 1-0 in the previous season's final, but were unable to defend their title after failing qualification for this edition's final tournament."
