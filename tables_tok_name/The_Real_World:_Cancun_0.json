  "intro": "The Real World: Cancun is the twenty-second season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the only season of The Real World to be filmed in Mexico. The season featured eight people who lived in a hotel converted into a suite. It is the fourth season of The Real World to be set outside the United States, after The Real World: London in 1995, The Real World: Paris in 2003, and The Real World: Sydney in 2007. Series co-creator Jonathan Murray explained the choice of Cancun, saying, Cancun is a good one to do after Brooklyn, which was a more gritty environment. Primary production started from January 26 to April 2009 and was not affected by the swine flu outbreak in Mexico. Executive Producer Jim Johnston said, We had stopped production before this thing reared its ugly head. Consisting of 12 episodes, the season premiered June 24 of that year and was viewed by 1.4 million viewers, the smallest debut ever for a season of The Real World at the time. The American synthpop band LMFAO has a guest appearance in Episode 7, which ties into the cast's work assignment. Bunim-Murray Productions also shot an unscripted 2003 movie called The Real Cancun, although it was unrelated to the series. This season's suite was used by the cast of The Real World: Las Vegas (2011) for their season vacation."
