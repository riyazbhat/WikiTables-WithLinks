  "intro": "The Real World: California (retrospectively referred to as The Real World: Los Angeles, to distinguish it from subsequent installments of the series) is the second season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months, as the cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the first season of The Real World to be filmed in the Pacific States region of the United States, specifically in California. The season featured a total of nine cast members over the course of the season, as one cast member was evicted and replaced, and another was replaced when she got married. The Real World expanded from 13 to 21 episodes with this season. Production for the season started from February to June 1993. This is the first of two seasons to be filmed in Los Angeles. In 2008, filming of the twentieth season again took place in Los Angeles, this time in the district of Hollywood. The season, which documented 22 weeks of the cast's interactions, began with two cast members being flown to Nashville and then spending ten days driving cross country to their Venice Beach house in a Winnebago, picking up a third cast member in Owensboro, Kentucky along the way."
