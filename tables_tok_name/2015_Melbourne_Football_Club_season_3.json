  "intro": "The 2015 Melbourne Football Club season was the club's 116th year in the VFL/AFL since it began in 1897. Despite improvements in 2014, Melbourne still produced a poor season in regards to results, which led to Melbourne receiving a financially and commercially challenging draw. The club played home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against , , , , , , and whom typically do not draw high crowds in Melbourne, and played , Fremantle, , St Kilda and Western Bulldogs twice. Games were broadcast on the Seven Network (free to air) for seven games, down from nine in 2014. Even with financial and commercial challenges, the club continued to host its annual Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in round 10 and played its first Friday night game since round 7, 2012, which was against in round 4 as a lead into ANZAC day. The club also played more traditional time slots, as the AFL aimed to have a more 'fan friendly' fixture, with seventeen day games (up from twelve), two twilight matches (down from five) and three at night (down from five). In addition, the club played 17 matches in Victoria, and traveled to Adelaide, Canberra, and Perth once, and the Northern Territory twice. Melbourne sold two of its home games to the Northern Territory due to a sponsorship deal made with Tourism NT. One was at TIO Traeger Park in Alice Springs in round 9 against for the second year in a row. The other match was at TIO Stadium in Darwin for the sixth year in a row, which was against in round 14. In addition Melbourne hosted Greater Western Sydney at Etihad Stadium in round 23. The club finished the season with 7 wins and 15 losses, this was the club's best result since the 2011 season."
