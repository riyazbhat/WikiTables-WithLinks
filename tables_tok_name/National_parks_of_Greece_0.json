  "section_text": "Such climatic and biological diversity , along with the rich flora and fauna that comes with it , made the need for the creation of national parks obvious as early as 1937 , when the government of Ioannis Metaxas , first issued a law that established national parks in Greece . In 1938 the first national park in Greece was established , the Mount Olympus National Park , followed by the immediate creation of the Parnassos National Park . The number of Greek national parks has grown ever since to a full number of ten :",

  "intro": "Greece is characterized by an extremely fragmented, rugged landscape hosting a great diversity of ecosystems and an outstanding biodiversity. Almost 5% of its extensive coastline consists of ecologically sensitive wetlands. Two thirds of the total population live no further than 2 km from the coast and most of the important urban centers are coastal, while almost all of the tourist infrastructure is divided among islands and the coastal mainland."
