  "intro": "The Big East Men's Basketball Tournament is the championship tournament of the Big East Conference in men's basketball. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. Since 1983, the tournament has been held in Madison Square Garden, New York City. As such, the tournament is the longest running conference tournament at any one site in all of college basketball. In 2011, Connecticut, led by Kemba Walker, became the first and only team in the Big East Tournament to ever win five games in five consecutive days to win the championship. The 2009 tournament featured a six-overtime game in the quarterfinals between the Connecticut Huskies and the Syracuse Orange, in which Syracuse prevailed, 127-117. The game, the second longest in NCAA history, started on the evening of March 12 and ended nearly four hours later in the early morning of March 13. Only three players have achieved repeat MVP honors: Georgetown's Patrick Ewing (1984-1985), Louisville's Peyton Siva (2012-2013), and Villanovas Josh Hart (2015,2017). As part of the deal in which the original Big East split into the new Big East and the American Athletic Conference, the new Big East retained the rights to the conference tournament. The new Big East extended their contract to host the tournament at Madison Square Garden through the 2025 season."
