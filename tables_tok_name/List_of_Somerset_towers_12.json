He also pegs three of the smaller towers in the western part of Somerset : Combe Florey about 1499 ; Fivehead , around 1505 ; and Langford Budville , 1509 . The end of the Perpendicular period in architecture coincides with construction of Ruishton , 1533 ; Chedzoy , 1539 ; and Batcombe and Chewton Mendip , around 1540 .",

  "intro": "The Somerset towers, church towers built in the 14th to 16th centuries, have been described as among England's finest contributions to medieval art. The paragraphs and descriptions below describe features of some of these towers. The organization follows Peter Poyntz-Wright's scheme for grouping the towers by what he understands to be roughly the date and group of mason-architects who built them. Poyntz-Wright's scheme came under criticism in the 1980s."
