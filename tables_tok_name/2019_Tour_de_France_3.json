The -long race consisted of 21 stages, starting on 6 July in Brussels, Belgium, and concluding on 28 July with the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in Paris. The opening stages of the Tour (known as the Grand D\u00e9part) were held in Brussels in honour of the 50th anniversary of the first Tour de France win of Eddy Merckx. A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won by Egan Bernal of . His teammate and 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas finished second while Steven Kruijswijk () came in third. Kruijswijk's teammate Mike Teunissen won stage 1's bunch sprint to take the first yellow of the Tour. Julian Alaphilippe of took the lead of the race following his victory of stage 3. He lost the yellow jersey after the sixth stage to Giulio Ciccone () who was the highest placed rider of a breakaway group which finished ahead of the peloton (main group). Ciccone's lead of the Tour lasted two stages, before Alaphilippe retook it after stage 8. He held the yellow jersey for the next eleven stages, including the Pyrenees, before losing it to Bernal on the second day in the Alps, stage 19, which was shortened by bad weather. Bernal held his lead in the final two stages to win the Tour."
