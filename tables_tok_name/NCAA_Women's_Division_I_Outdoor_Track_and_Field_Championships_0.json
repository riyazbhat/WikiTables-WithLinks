  "intro": "The NCAA Division I Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championships are the annual collegiate track and field competitions for women athletes representing Division I institutions organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athletes' performances in individual championships earn points for their institutions and the team with the most points receives the NCAA team title in track and field. A separate NCAA Division I men's competition is also held. These two events are separate from the NCAA Division I Women's Indoor Track and Field Championships and NCAA Division I Men's Indoor Track and Field Championships held during the winter. The first edition of the championship was held in 1982. The current team champions are the Arkansas Razorbacks, and the most successful team, with 14 titles, are the LSU Lady Tigers. LSU would be credited with a fifteenth title in 2012 but were disqualified when one of their athletes, Trinidadian athlete Semoy Hackett, tested positive for methylhexaneamine and was banned from international competition for two years and four months."
