  "intro": "The following lists show the names, substantive ranks, and brevet ranks (if applicable) of all general officers who served in the United States Army during the Civil War, in addition to a small selection of lower-ranked officers who received brevets as general officers; while some 1,600 officers received or were nominated for brevets as general officers in the course of the war (or immediately following it for service during the war), only a small selection is listed here; only those who were killed in action, served as department heads within the army, had revoked or incomplete appointments or became U.S. President are listed here. In addition to their names and ranks, there is a small set of notes after every entry listing Medal of Honor or Thanks of Congress citations, West Point graduation dates, important political or Army offices held, retirements or deaths during the war (whether in action or other means), notable relations, rejections or expiration of appointments, or unique facts pertaining to this article (i.e. youngest general, last surviving general, etc. ); for all other information on their lives and accomplishments, please refer to their individual entries. If available, ranks are followed by the to rank from dates (i.e. the date on which the commission is effective) rather than the date of appointment or confirmation, which were generally months if not years later; this is particularly true in the case of brevets, most of which were granted after the war between 1866 and 1869.
