  "intro": "The 2011 Canadian Soccer League season (known as the Givova Canadian Soccer League for sponsorship reasons) was the 14th since its establishment where a total of 28 teams from Ontario and Quebec took part in the league. The season began on Saturday 6 May 2011, and concluded on 29 October 2011. Toronto Croatia won their fourth championship (seventh including Canadian National Soccer League titles) in a 1-0 victory over Capital City F.C. in the CSL Championship final at Centennial Park Stadium in Toronto. The regular season saw SC Toronto claim their second regular season title, while Mississauga Eagles FC B won their first Second Division championship. The season saw an increase in membership to 14 teams the largest amount since the 2002 season. The new entries saw the return of professional soccer to the communities of Windsor, Mississauga, and Ottawa. After one season as commissioner Domenic Di Gironimo resigned with Vincent Ursini returning to be named his successor. The 2011 season witnessed the fruits of the CSL player developmental system as nine CSL players were selected to represent the Canada U-17 in the 2011 CONCACAF U-17 Championship. While 14 CSL players participated in the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup, and 4 players were selected to represent the Canada U-20 in the 2011 CONCACAF U-20 Championship. To further implement their developmental system the league formed a working relationship with the newly formed Canadian Academy of Futbol (CAF), which required their member clubs to form affiliations with academy teams. The ownership structure of the league was reformed into an incorporated body as the CSL Association Inc in order to bring about a slow process of equalization to the status of teams, while compensating the equity owners who had heavily invested in league throughout the years."
