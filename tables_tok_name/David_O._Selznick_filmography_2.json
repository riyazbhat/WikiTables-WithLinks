  "section_text": "In response to my question as to what will happen to Schulberg , he [ Lasky ] said , in effect , that they would be kicking him upstairs . \u2026 One of my rows with Paramount \u2026 was my insistence that no one man could possibly personally produce more than a few pictures per year . \u2014 David O. Selznick [ 23 ] In early 1928 Selznick accepted the position of assistant to producer B. P. Schulberg at Paramount Studios . The professional relationship between the two , however , eventually deteriorated after Schulberg went to Europe for several months in 1929 . During his absence , studio head Jesse L. Lasky placed Selznick into Schulberg 's position and decided to keep him there . Selznick remained with Paramount until his resignation in June 1931 .",

  "intro": "David O. Selznick (1902-1965) was an American motion picture producer whose work consists of three short subjects, 67 feature films, and one television production made between 1923 and 1957. He was the producer of the 1939 epic Gone With the Wind. Selznick was born in Pittsburgh and educated in public schools in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He began working in the film industry in New York while in his teens as an assistant to his father, jeweler-turned-film producer Lewis J. Selznick. In 1923, he began producing films himself, starting with two documentary shorts and then a minor feature, Roulette (1924). Moving to Hollywood in 1926, Selznick became employed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he produced two films before switching to Paramount in early 1928. After helping to guide Paramount into the sound era, Selznick moved to RKO Radio in 1931 where he served as the studio's executive producer. During his time at RKO he oversaw the production of King Kong (1933) and helped to develop Katharine Hepburn and Myrna Loy into major film stars. In 1933 Selznick returned to MGM, this time as a vice-president in charge of his own production unit. During his two years with the studio he produced elaborate versions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Charles Dickens' David Copperfield and A Tale of Two Cities. In 1935, he left MGM to form his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, where he produced adaptations of Robert Smythe Hichens' The Garden of Allah (1936), Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), and Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938). Selznick also became a pioneer in the use of Technicolor with the first and last of these films and also with his productions of A Star is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937)."
