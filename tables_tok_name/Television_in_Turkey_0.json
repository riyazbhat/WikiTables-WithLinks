  "intro": "Television in Turkey was introduced in 1952 with the launch of ITU TV. The first national television channel is TRT 1, which was introduced in 1968. Color television was introduced in 1981. Back then it was the only channel with the name of TRT 1, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. Turkey's first private television channel Star started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until the 1990s, there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by Kanal D, ATV and Show, with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms Digit\u00fcrk and D-Smart and the cable TV service T\u00fcrksat."
