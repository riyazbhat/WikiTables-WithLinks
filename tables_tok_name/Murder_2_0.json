  "intro": "Murder 2 is a 2011 Bollywood crime thriller film. It is the second installment in the Murder film series and the quasi-sequel to the 2004 film, Murder. It stars Emraan Hashmi, Jacqueline Fernandez and Prashant Narayanan as the main leads, and features Sulagna Panigrahi as a debutant. Directed by Mohit Suri and produced by Mukesh Bhatt, the film released on 8 July 2011. The theatrical trailer of the film was revealed on 1 June 2011 and also in cinemas with Ready. It was the second film in a series of quasi-sequels released under the Bhatt Banner including Raaz - The Mystery Continues, Jannat 2, Jism 2, Raaz 3D and 1920: Evil Returns, each of which had nothing to do with their respective prequels, but somehow fell into the same genre following a similar story. It is one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2011. The movie is alleged to be based on the 2008 South Korean movie The Chaser, though Bhatt denied this and said that it was inspired from the 2006 Nithari killings in Noida."
