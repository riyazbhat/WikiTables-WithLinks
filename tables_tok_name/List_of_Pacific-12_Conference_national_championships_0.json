  "intro": "The following is a list of current Pac-12 Conference members' NCAA and AIAW championships. The Pac-12 was the first conference to win 500 team titles & currently (As of January 15, 2020) Pac-12 members have won 529 NCAA national championships, which is 238 more than the next closest conference, The Big Ten. Since the 1999-2000 academic year, the Pac-12 claims a total of 202 NCAA team titles, including 3 by 1 schools in 2019-2020. They have also led or tied the nation in NCAA Championships in 53 of the last 56 years, including the past 14 years, the only exceptions being in 1980-81, 1988-89, 1990-91 and 1995-96 when the conference finished second, and finished third in 1998-99 and 2004-2005. This list also includes championships won by current Pac-12 schools while members of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), a closely related league that was formed in 1916 and disbanded in 1959. Although the current charter of what is now known as the Pac-12 dates only to the formation of the Athletic Association of Western Universities immediately after the demise of the PCC, the Pac-12 claims the PCC's history as its own. There is considerable continuity between the PCC and Pac-12 - eight of the nine final members of the PCC (all except Idaho) are now Pac-12 members; five of these schools had founded the AAWU, and all eight had joined the AAWU by the 1964-65 school year."
