Tisdale made her acting debut at age 12 with small roles in the 1997 television series Smart Guy and 7th Heaven. A year later, she had her first voice role in the feature film A Bug's Life. In the following years, she had small roles in television shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210 (2000), The Amanda Show (2000), The Hughleys (2002), Still Standing (2003) and Boston Public (2000). Her performance in the last earned her a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Television Drama Series. She was eventually cast in her first main role in Disney Channel's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody in 2005, which had three seasons (2005-2008). Tisdale's breakthrough role came in the 2006 television movie High School Musical, which became Disney Channel's most-watched movie that year. The High School Musical series became a successful franchise which included the second television movie High School Musical 2 (2007), a feature film High School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008), and a spin-off movie Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure (2011). She has a main role in Phineas & Ferb (2007-2015), which became television's most-watched animated series among kids and tweens and had very positive reviews, and had guest appearances in Kim Possible (2007), Family Guy (2009), The Cleveland Show (2009), Glenn Martin, DDS (2009) and Fish Hooks (2009). In 2010, Tisdale made her return to broadcast television.
