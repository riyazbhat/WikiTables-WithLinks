She was the face of Armani fragrance Gio, appearing in their TV commercial directed by David Lynch, and also of Ultima II for Revlon, Banana Republic, and Oil of Olay.

She was featured in national advertisements, including Herb Ritts' commercial Pasha for Cartier in 1994. Harris is known for film appearances in No Man's Land, The Fourth War, The Fisher King, Singles, Demolition Man and All Tied Up. She has also started directing, writing and producing films, and won Best Short Film at the Aspen Comedy Festival for her first film, 9 1/2 Minutes. Harris continued her studies with a graduate course in psychology and is a psychotherapist in addition to acting and modeling."
