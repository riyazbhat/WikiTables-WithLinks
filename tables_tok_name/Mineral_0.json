  "section_text": "Main article : Mohs scale of mineral hardness Diamond is the hardest natural material , and has a Mohs hardness of 10 . The hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching . This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral . A mineral 's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides , which is a function of its structure ; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others . [ 67 ] An example of this property exists in kyanite , which has a Mohs hardness of 5\u00bd parallel to [ 001 ] but 7 parallel to [ 100 ] . [ 68 ] The most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale . Defined by ten indicators , a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it . The scale ranges from talc , a phyllosilicate , to diamond , a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material . The scale is provided below : [ 67 ]",

  "intro": "A mineral is, broadly speaking, a solid chemical compound that occurs naturally in pure form. Minerals are most commonly associated with rocks due to the presence of minerals within rocks. These rocks may consist of one type of mineral, or may be an aggregate of two or more different types of minerals, spacially segregated into distinct phases. Compounds that occur only in living beings are usually excluded, but some minerals are often biogenic (such as calcite) or are organic compounds in the sense of chemistry (such as mellite). Moreover, living beings often synthesize inorganic minerals (such as hydroxylapatite) that also occur in rocks. In geology and mineralogy, the term mineral is usually reserved for mineral species: crystalline compounds with a fairly well-defined chemical composition and a specific crystal structure. Minerals without a definite crystalline structure, such as opal or obsidian, are then more properly called mineraloids. If a chemical compound may occur naturally with different crystal structures, each structure is considered different mineral species. Thus, for example, quartz and stishovite are two different minerals consisting of the same compound, silicon dioxide. The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is the world's premier standard body for the definition and nomenclature of mineral species. As of November 2018, the IMA recognizes 5,413 official mineral species. out of more than 5,500 proposed or traditional ones."
