  "intro": "The 2002 Triple J Hottest 100, announced on 26 January 2003, was the tenth such countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J. As in previous years, a CD featuring 39 (not necessarily the top 39) songs was released. For the first time, a DVD, containing film clips of songs from the Hottest 100 was also released. This was also the last time that phone voting was allowed; in the 2003 poll, only internet voting was permitted. SMS voting was removed for the 2003 poll but was reinstated in the 2004 event\n When the announcers got to the number one track, they announced that rapper Nelly's song Hot in Herre was top, and began playing it. Part way through the song, they declared that it had been a joke, broke the CD on air, and began playing Queens of the Stone Age's No One Knows. The band Salmon Hater came in at number 26 with their song 6.66 after Triple J morning show hosts Adam Spencer and Wil Anderson made an effort to rig the event, telling listeners to vote for the otherwise unlikely candidate."
