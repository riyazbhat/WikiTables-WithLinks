  "section_title": "Treasures -- Japanese manuscripts",
  "section_text": "In Japan , until the Heian period , the language of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees , codes , commands , communications and certificates . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Consequently , Chinese books were essential for the education of the ( male ) aristocracy , and beginning readers studied books such as the Mencius or the Thousand Character Classic . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Towards the end of the 7th century , to prepare selected sons of the nobility for a government career , Emperor Tenji established the Daigaku-ry\u014d ( `` Academy '' ) . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] At first the curriculum consisted mainly of Confucian Classics and Chinese history . [ nb 9 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century , and the Academy 's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan , Records of the Grand Historian and the Books of Han and Later Han . [ 37 ] [ 39 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Unlike in China at the time , Classical Confucian studies , especially the historical and political side of Confucianism , were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty . [ 46 ] In fact , one of the Japanese emperor 's prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics , histories , and poetic anthologies . [ 47 ] Chinese books had reached Japan since circa 400 AD and had been imported in large quantities through a number of missions during the Sui and Tang Dynasties . Official missions ended after 894 , but books continued to reach Japan in the mid to late Heian period through commercial exchange or via priests travelling to China . [ 48 ] Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries , but unlike sutra copying little is known about the actual copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan . [ 49 ] The Japanese aristocracy and clergy sponsored the transcription of religious and government texts on a large scale by the Nara period . [ 50 ] The first state library was the Zusho-ry\u014d ( `` Bureau of Archives '' ) established by the Taih\u014d Code from 701 . [ nb 10 ] [ 51 ] Attached to the Daigaku-ry\u014d , it oversaw the custody ( collection and preservation ) and transmission of Buddhist and Confucian books from the Nara period , until its destruction by fire in the mid-Heian period ( 11th century ) . [ 8 ] [ 42 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Collection depended largely on the copying of texts held elsewhere . [ 49 ] [ 51 ] In addition to the Zusho-ry\u014d , books were also copied at imperial palace libraries , private libraries of aristocrats , temple libraries and at libraries of organs of the state . [ 42 ] [ 51 ] [ 53 ] In the Heian period , the majority of works held in libraries ( both those produced in China and those copied in Japan ) consisted of Chinese works and scholarly collections were dominated by Chinese secular works . [ 54 ] At the end of the Heian period , the great fire of Kyoto in 1177 , and the burning of temples by the Taira in 1180 , destroyed a large part of the literary heritage . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] During the Kamakura period , the warrior class founded new libraries such as the Kanazawa Bunko . [ 56 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_Chinese_books)_1",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 56 entries from the 7th century Tang Dynasty to the Kamakura period with more than half originating in China. The total number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The list contains works that have been originally compiled in China by Chinese authors. A large proportion of these works are Chinese classics. Written language was introduced to Japan around 400 AD in the form of Chinese books written in Classical Chinese. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased towards the end of the 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, and to bring back books. During circa 300 years in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand."
