          "On the evening of June 7 , 1992 , Sharon Carr had been hanging out with two older men in Surrey , England , before spotting a distraught 18-year-old hairdresser named Katie Rackliff , who had just suffered a break-up with her ex-boyfriend . Under the guise of providing Rackliff with a ride back to her house , Carr tricked the woman into joining the group . Instead of pulling through on her initial offer , Sharon Carr and her accomplices drove Rackliff out into an empty area . Rackliff , who had grown nervous and suspicious , fled the car , with Sharon immediately on her tail . Before Rackliff could flee the scene , Carr withdrew a blade and stabbed Rackliff approximately 32 times and abandoning her body . Upon the discovery of Katie Rackliff 's body , police had assumed a male suspect rather than a female due to the gruesome nature of the crime scene . Carr was jailed in 1994 after police discovered her diaries with entries relating to Rackliff 's murder , after she stabbed a pupil at her secondary school . She remains in jail and will likely never be released as she is regarded a 'danger to society '"
