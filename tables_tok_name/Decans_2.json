  "section_text": "There were two main versions of rulership given to the decans in the ancient world : Chaldean rulership and rulership by Triplicity . `` The Faces of the Planets '' * ( Lilly ) [ 24 ] Sign First Decan ruler ( 0 - 9.999 deg . ) Second Decan ruler ( 10 - 19.999 deg . ) Third Decan ruler ( 20 - 29.999 deg . ) Aries Mars Sun Venus Taurus Mercury Moon Saturn Gemini Jupiter Mars Sun Cancer Venus Mercury Moon Leo Saturn Jupiter Mars Virgo Sun Venus Mercury Libra Moon Saturn Jupiter Scorpio Mars Sun Venus Sagittarius Mercury Moon Saturn Capricorn Jupiter Mars Sun Aquarius Venus Mercury Moon Pisces Saturn Jupiter Mars * as used as an essential dignity in astrology . Notice that rulerships follow a repeating pattern , the so-called `` Chaldean '' order of the planets : Saturn , Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury , Moon . This planetary order , in which the Sun stands at the center of the continuum , with the planets between the Sun and the Earth on one side and the outer planets on the other side , reflected the perception of the speed of each planet 's motion as seen from the Earth .",

  "intro": "The decans (/\u02c8d\u025bk\u0259nz/; Egyptian baktiu) are 36 groups of stars (small constellations) used in the Ancient Egyptian astronomy. They rose consecutively on the horizon throughout each earth rotation. The rising of each decan marked the beginning of a new decanal hour (Greek h\u014dra) of the night for the ancient Egyptians, and they were used as a sidereal star clock beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (c. 2100 BCE). Because a new decan also appears heliacally every ten days (that is, every ten days, a new decanic star group reappears in the eastern sky at dawn right before the Sun rises, after a period of being obscured by the Sun's light), the ancient Greeks called them dekanoi (\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af; pl. of \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 dekanos) or tenths. Decans continued to be used throughout the Renaissance in astrology and in magic, but modern astrologers almost entirely ignore them. [citation needed]"
