These guitars were purchased by the studios , and in some cases , were identical to Presley 's own performance guitars . The Gibson J-200 used in Loving You , King Creole , and G.I .

  "intro": "Guitars were a major component of the rock and roll image created by Elvis Presley in the 1950s and 1960s, onstage and in film appearances. According to his first lead guitarist, Scotty Moore, Presley was not an accomplished musician, yet he possessed an uncanny and amazing sense of timing and rhythm. In the early years of his career, Presley's rhythm guitar accompaniment played a major role in the sound of his early performances and recordings. Moore noted that as Presley began to learn to move on stage and to work the audience with his physical performance, his guitar became more of a prop. Presley was not known to treat his instruments gently. The lack of a microphone on his guitar in his early years contributed to the development of his aggressive style in attempt to be heard, and his strumming style would frequently break strings during his performances. As his career progressed, he became even more aggressive toward his instruments, frequently tossing his guitar to Charlie Hodge, who sometimes failed to catch it. As well, the large belt buckles and jewelry Presley wore left their marks on most of his instruments."
