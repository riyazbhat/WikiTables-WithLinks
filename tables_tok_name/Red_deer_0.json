  "section_title": "Taxonomy and evolution",
  "section_text": "Until recently , biologists considered the red deer and elk or wapiti ( C. canadensis ) the same species , forming a continuous distribution throughout temperate Eurasia and North America . This belief was based largely on the fully fertile hybrids that can be produced under captive conditions . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Genetic evidence clearly shows the wapiti and red deer form two separate species . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Among red deer , the easternmost forms ( from the Caspian Sea to western China ) form a primordial subgroup , which includes the Yarkand deer and Bactrian deer ( the two may be synonymous ) . [ 28 ] Another member of the red deer group which may represent a separate species is C . corsicanus . [ 31 ] If so , C. corsicanus includes the subspecies C. e. barbarus ( perhaps a synonym of C. e. corsicanus ) , and is restricted to Maghreb in North Africa , Corsica , and Sardinia . [ 28 ] [ 31 ] The International Union for Conservation of Nature originally listed nine subspecies of red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) : three as endangered , one as vulnerable , one as near threatened , and four without enough data to give a category ( Data Deficient ) . The species as a whole , however , is listed as least concern . [ 1 ] However , this was based on the traditional classification of red deer as one species ( Cervus elaphus ) , including the wapiti . The common red deer is also known as simply red deer . Selected members of the red deer species group are listed in the table below . Of the ones listed , C. e. hippelaphus , C. e. scoticus , and C. e. bactrianus may all be junior synonyms . [ 28 ] Cervus elaphus appeared in the Europe by the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene around 800,000 years ago . These earliest forms belonged to the palaeosubspecies Cervus elaphus acoronatus . Other palaeosubspecies are known , including those belonging to C. elaphus rianensis from the Middle Pleistocene of Italy , C. elaphus siciliae from the late Middle and Late Pleistocene of Sicily .

  "intro": "The red deer (Cervus elaphus) is one of the largest deer species. The red deer inhabits most of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains region, Asia Minor, Iran, parts of western Asia, and central Asia. It also inhabits the Atlas Mountains region between Morocco and Tunisia in northwestern Africa, being the only species of deer to inhabit Africa. Red deer have been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina. In many parts of the world, the meat (venison) from red deer is used as a food source. Red deer are ruminants, characterized by a four-chambered stomach. Genetic evidence indicates the red deer as traditionally defined is a species group, rather than a single species, although it remains disputed as to exactly how many species the group includes. The closely related and slightly larger American elk or wapiti, native to North America and eastern parts of Asia, had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer, but recently it has been established as a distinct species. It is probable that the ancestor of all red deer, including wapiti, originated in central Asia and resembled sika deer. Although at one time red deer were rare in parts of Europe, they were never close to extinction. Reintroduction and conservation efforts, such as in the United Kingdom and Portugal, have resulted in an increase of red deer populations, while other areas, such as North Africa, have continued to show a population decline."
