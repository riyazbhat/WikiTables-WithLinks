  "intro": "Transport for NSW, sometimes abbreviated to TfNSW, and pronounced as Transport for New South Wales, is a statutory authority of the New South Wales Government created on 1 November 2011, and is the leading transport and roads agency in New South Wales, Australia. The authority is a separate entity from the New South Wales Department of Transport, the ultimate parent entity of Transport for NSW and a department of the New South Wales Government. The agency's function since its creation is to building transport infrastructure and manage transport services in New South Wales. Since absorbing Roads & Maritime Services (RMS) in December 2019, the agency is also responsible for building and maintaining road infrastructure, managing the day-to-day compliance and safety for roads and waterways, and vehicle and driving license registrations. The chief executive officer, called Secretary, for the agency is Rodd Staples. The authority reports to the New South Wales Minister for Transport and Roads, presently Andrew Constance and the Minister for Regional Transport and Roads, presently Paul Toole. Ultimately the ministers are responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales."
