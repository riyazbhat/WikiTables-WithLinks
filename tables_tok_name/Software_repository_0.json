  "section_title": "Selected repositories",
  "section_text": "The following table lists a few languages with repositories for contributed software . The `` Autochecks '' column describes the routine checks done . Very few people have the ability to test their software under multiple operating-systems with different versions of the core code and with other contributed packages they may use . For R , the Comprehensive R Archive Network ( CRAN ) runs tests routinely . To see how this is valuable , suppose Sally contributes a package A. Sally only runs the current version of the software under one version of Microsoft Windows , and has only tested it in that environment . At more or less regular intervals , CRAN tests Sally 's contribution under a dozen combinations of operating systems and versions of the core R language software . If one of them generates an error , she gets that error message . With luck , that error message may suffice to allow her to fix the error , even if she can not replicate it with the hardware and software she has . Next , suppose John contributes to the repository a package B that uses a package A . Package B passes all the tests and is made available to users . Later , Sally submits an improved version of A , which unfortunately , breaks B . The autochecks make it possible to provide information to John so he can fix the problem . This example exposes both a strength and a weakness in the R contributed-package system : CRAN supports this kind of automated testing of contributed packages , but packages contributed to CRAN need not specify the versions of other contributed packages that they use . Procedures for requesting specific versions of packages exist , but contributors might not use those procedures . Beyond this , a repository such as CRAN running regular checks of contributed packages actually provides an extensive if ad hoc test suite for development versions of the core language . If Sally ( in the example above ) gets an error message she does not understand or thinks is inappropriate , especially from a development version of the language , she can ( and often does with R ) ask the core development-team for the language for help . In this way , the repository can contribute to improving the quality of the core language software .",

  "intro": "A software repository, or repo for short, is a storage location where software packages are stored and retrieved. A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers. Package Managers allow for installing and updating the repositories (sometimes called packages) versus having to manually do this."
