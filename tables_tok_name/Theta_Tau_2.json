  "intro": "Theta Tau (\u0398\u03a4) is a professional engineering fraternity. The fraternity has programs to promote the social, academic, and professional development of its members. Today, Theta Tau is the oldest and largest professional engineering fraternity and has a membership of men and women who study engineering in all its various branches on over 100 college campuses. The fraternity was first founded by four engineering students at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota as the Society of Hammer and Tongs on October 15, 1904. Its founders were Erich J. Schrader, Elwin L. Vinal, William M. Lewis, and Isaac B. Hanks. The Fraternity's Greek letter name Theta Tau was formally adopted at the first National Convention at the University of Minnesota in 1911. Since then, over 40,000 members have been initiated. The Theta Tau Central Office is located in the Brickell area of Miami, Florida."
