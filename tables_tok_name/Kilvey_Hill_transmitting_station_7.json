  "section_text": "The UK 's digital switchover commenced with Kilvey Hill on 12 August 2009 . Analogue BBC Two Wales on channel 26 was first to close , and ITV Wales was moved from channel 23 to channel 26 for its last month of service . With it went Mux 1 from channel 25- to be replaced by the new BBC A mux which started up in 64-QAM and at full power ( i.e . 2 kW ) on channel 23 which had just been vacated in the shuffle .",
  "uid": "Kilvey_Hill_transmitting_station_7",
  "intro": "The Kilvey Hill transmitting station was originally built at the summit of Kilvey Hill in Swansea, Wales, by the BBC in 1967 as a relay for VHF and UHF television. VHF television came on air a few months before the UHF services. As built, the station did not radiate VHF FM radio, this was added later. Currently, the hill's transmitters cater for viewers and listeners in the Swansea and Neath Port Talbot area. The transmission station located on top of Kilvey Hill is owned and operated by Arqiva. Freeview digital terrestrial TV was already available at low power from this transmitter before the digital switchover process began, with the first stage taking place on Wednesday 12 August 2009. The second stage was completed on Wednesday 9 September 2009, with the transmitter becoming the first in Wales to complete digital switchover. After the switchover process, analogue channels ceased broadcasting permanently and the Freeview power increased from 383 W ERP to 2 kW ERP, a 7 dB power increase."
