  "section_text": "See also : Big Golden Arena for Best Film and Pula Film Festival Below is the complete list of films produced by Jadran Film which won the Golden Arena for Best Film , the main award at the Pula Film Festival . The festival served as the Yugoslav national film awards ( i.e . the local equivalent of the Academy Award ) since its establishment in 1955 until 1990 . Due to the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s the festival was re-branded as the Croatian film awards in 1992 . A total of 11 Jadran Film films won the award in Yugoslav competition , and another two won the award since 1992 .",

  "intro": "Jadran Film is a film production studio and distribution company founded in 1946 in Zagreb, Croatia. In the period between the early 1960s and late 1980s Jadran Film was one of the biggest and most notable film studios in Central Europe, with some 145 international and around 120 Yugoslav productions filmed at the studio during those three decades, including two Oscar-winning films and Orson Welles' 1962 screen adaptation of Franz Kafka's novel The Trial. The word Jadran refers to the Adriatic Sea in Croatian. During most of its existence it was one of the two main film studios in Yugoslav cinema (along with Avala Film of Belgrade) and was one of the few film companies which played a major role in the post-World War II history of Croatian cinema, along with Croatia Film and Zagreb Film (which is mainly known for animated films). In the 1990s the company experienced a sharp downturn amid the breakup of Yugoslavia and most of the company's property was either sold or fell into disrepair in the ensuing privatization. The company still continues to produce films, although Jadran Film's once voluminous output has since dwindled to only a handful of films produced every year, mainly Croatian and regional co-productions."
