  "section_text": "The Vancouver Giants celebrate after winning the 2007 championship on home ice . The Memorial Cup tournament was expanded to four teams in 1983 ; a pre-determined host team was added in place of holding the tournament in a neutral host city . The first such host team was the Portland Winter Hawks , who set numerous firsts in the 1983 tournament . It represented the first time Memorial Cup games were held outside Canada , and by virtue of winning the tournament , the Winter Hawks became the first American team to win the Cup . The Winter Hawks also became the first team in Memorial Cup history to win the championship despite failing to win its own league title\u2014they had been defeated by the Lethbridge Broncos in the WHL playoffs . [ 15 ] The four-team format remains in use , and the host team cycles evenly between all three leagues . In 1987 , however , only three teams competed for the Memorial Cup . To determine the host team for that tournament , the OHL held a `` super series '' between its two regular season division winners before the start of the playoffs . The tournament was won by the Oshawa Generals , who went on to win the OHL championship . As a result , the OHL chose to send only Oshawa to the Memorial Cup . [ 16 ] In all other tournaments , if the host team had also won their league title , the runner-up from the championship series qualified for the Memorial Cup as their league 's representative . Since the current format was adopted , the Memorial Cup has been won by each league : Western Hockey League ( WHL ) : 16 times Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) : 12 times Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) : 9 times Impact of automatic tournament berth for host team ( since 1983 ) : Host teams that have won league championship : 6 ( Kamloops 1995 , Peterborough 1996 , Hull 1997 , London 2005 , Moncton 2006 , Kitchener 2008 ) Host teams that have won Memorial Cup : 10 ( Portland 1983 , Sault Ste .

  "intro": "The Memorial Cup is a junior ice hockey club championship trophy awarded annually to the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) champion. Each year the champions from three CHL member leagues - the Western Hockey League (WHL), Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), along with a host team - compete in the MasterCard Memorial Cup Tournament. The QMJHL's Rouyn-Noranda Huskies are the defending champions. Known originally as the OHA Memorial Cup, it was donated in 1919 by the Ontario Hockey Association in honour of the soldiers who died fighting for Canada in World War I. In 2010, the trophy was rededicated to honour all soldiers who died for Canada in any conflict. From its donation in 1919 until 1971, the Memorial Cup was awarded via a series of playoffs to the junior hockey champion of Canada. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association moved to the current tournament format in 1972 when it divided Junior A hockey into two tiers, naming the Memorial Cup as the championship of the Major Junior rank. Sixty teams across the CHL's three member leagues are eligible to compete for the Memorial Cup, representing nine provinces and four American states. The Western Hockey League has won the title 19 times since the adoption of the three league tournament format in 1972. The Ontario Hockey League has 17 titles, and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League has 12. Since the creation of the Memorial Cup, the Toronto Marlboros have won the most titles with seven. Among currently active teams, the Oshawa Generals lead with five titles, the latest one in 2015, while the Regina Pats follow with four."
