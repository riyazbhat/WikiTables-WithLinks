  "section_text": "Next Generation [ 15 ] or Third Generation Advanced [ 16 ] are still under development or at early stages of their generation . While the term ' ( Fourth ) Next generation ' and 'Third generation advanced ' have no formal basis , these main battle tanks are using the latest technology and designs to compete with the current advanced warfare environment . [ 17 ] `` Third Generation Advanced '' been stated , rather than `` Next Generation '' in many premieres for these tanks . Those described as `` Third Generation Advanced '' are normally upgraded variants using the same framework of the standard third generation tank . They have their advancements built into existing or newly designed frames than being an add-on technology . Those described as `` Next Generation '' have had their tanks and their advanced features designed and built from scratch and are not considered upgrades of previous existing tanks . Next Generation/Third Generation Advanced",
  "uid": "List_of_main_battle_tanks_by_generation_3",
  "intro": "Main battle tanks are often classified as belonging to a particular generation, although the actual definition and membership in these generations is not clearly defined. Soviet and Russian military planners organize tanks with first generation of tanks up to 1945, and four generations of main battle tanks[Note 1] while Canadian strategists organize main battle tanks into three generations. [Note 2] The military of the People's Republic of China also recognizes three generations of its own tanks. In 1983, Rolf Hilmes saw three tank generations and three intermediate generations, which consisted mainly of upgraded vehicles. The first generation of main battle tanks were based on or influenced by designs of World War II, most notably the T-34 and the Panther tank. The second generation was equipped with NBC protection (only sometimes), IR night vision devices, a stabilized main gun and at least a mechanical fire control system. The third generation is determined by the usage of thermal imagers, digital fire control systems and special (composite) armour. However, Hilmes acknowledged that tanks cannot be definitively grouped by generations, as each tank-producing country develops and introduces its tanks in tune with its own ideas and needs. He also states that breakdown of postwar tanks by generations is based on timeframe and technical factors, as a basis for further discussion."
