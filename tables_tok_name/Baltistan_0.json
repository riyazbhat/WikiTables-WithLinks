  "intro": "The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica characterises Baltistan as the western extremity of Tibet, whose natural limits are the Indus river from its abrupt southward bend around the map point 35\u00b052\u2032N 74\u00b043\u2032E / 35.86\u00b0N 74.72\u00b0E / 35.86; 74.72 (Bend in the Indus course) and the mountains to the north and west. These features separate a comparatively peaceful Tibetan population from the fiercer Indo-Aryan tribes to the west. Muslim writers around the 16th century speak of Baltistan as the Little Tibet, and of Ladakh as the Great Tibet, emphasising their ethnological similarity. According to Ahmad Hassan Dani, Baltistan spreads upwards from the Indus river and is separated from Ladakh by the Siachen glacier. It includes the Indus valley and the lower valley of the Shyok river. Baltistan is a rocky mass of lofty mountains, the prevailing formation being gneiss. In the north is the Baltoro Glacier, the largest out of the arctic regions, 56 kilometres (35 mi) long, contained between two ridges whose highest peaks to the south are 7,600 m (25,000 ft) and to the north 8,615 m (28,265 ft). The Indus river runs in a narrow gorge, widening after receiving the Shyok river at 35\u00b014\u2032N 75\u00b055\u2032E / 35.23\u00b0N 75.92\u00b0E / 35.23; 75.92 (Shyok joins Indus). It then forms a 32-kilometre (20 mi) crescent-shaped plain varying between 2 and 8 kilometres (1 and 5 mi) wide. The main inhabitable valleys of Kharmang Khaplu, Skardu and Roundu are along the routes of these rivers."
