  "intro": "Kansas City (abbreviated KC or KCMO) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Missouri by population and area. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had an estimated population of 491,918 in 2018, making it the 38th most-populous city in the United States. It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Kansas-Missouri state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within Jackson County, but portions spill into Clay, Cass, and Platte counties. The city borders Johnson County and Kansas City, Kansas, (KCK/Wyandotte County) in Kansas. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a Missouri River port at its confluence with the Kansas River coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. In 2017, the city had the fifth-highest per capita murder rate in the nation with 2019 homicide rates nearing a record high. Sitting on Missouri's western boundary with Kansas, with Downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses some 319.03 square miles (826.3 km2), making it the 23rd largest city by total area in the United States. Along with Independence, one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of Blue Springs and Lee's Summit and the Kansas cities of Overland Park, Olathe, and Kansas City."
