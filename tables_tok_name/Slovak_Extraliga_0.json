  "intro": "The Slovak Tipsport Liga (Slovak Extraliga) is the highest-level ice hockey league in Slovakia. Since the 2018-19 season, the league also includes two teams from Hungary. In 2009, it was ranked by the IIHF as the fifth strongest league in Europe and in 2012, it was ranked by The Hockey News as the sixth-strongest league in the world behind the NHL, KHL, Swedish Hockey League, SM-liiga and Czech Extraliga. However, it has dropped significantly since then, with the American Hockey League, Swiss National League, German DEL and Austrian EBEL, among others, all now ranked ahead. The name of the league is leased to sponsors and changes frequently. From 1993/94 to 1997/98, it was called Extraliga, then the name changed to West Extraliga until the end of the 2000/01 season. In 2001/02, its name was Boss Extraliga. From the 2002/03 season to 2004/05, the name was ST Extraliga and in 2005/06 to T-Com Extraliga. On 16 January 2007, the name changed to Slovnaft Extraliga when a general sponsorship agreement with Slovnaft was signed, in 2011/12 it became the Tipsport Extraliga and Slovnaft-Play-off, and since the 2015/16 season it has been called the Tipsport liga and Slovnaft-Play-off. The Slovak Extraliga is rooted in the Czechoslovak Extraliga. The 1993/94 season was the first for the Slovak Extraliga after Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1 January 1993."
