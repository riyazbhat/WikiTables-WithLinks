  "intro": "Strictly Come Dancing returned for its ninth series on 10 September 2011 with a launch show, with the live shows starting on 30 September and 1 October 2011. The show was broadcast from Wembley Arena on 19 November with all proceeds going to the BBC charity, Children in Need. The final took place at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and was the first episode in 3D, and was shown on BBC HD and 18 cinemas around the country. As in series 8 there are 14 couples with one new male professional, Pasha Kovalev, replacing Jared Murillo. Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly continued to present the main show on BBC One, while the results show was presented by Daly and Claudia Winkleman. Former contestant Zo\u00eb Ball replaced Winkleman as the regular presenter of the spin-off show Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two due to Winkleman's family commitments. On 5 and 6 November Jennifer Grey, the winner of the eleventh series of Dancing with the Stars, the American version of 'Strictly', was a guest judge, replacing Len Goodman while he had a week off. In Goodman's absence, Craig Revel Horwood was head Judge. The full lineup of celebrities was revealed on 6 September 2011 on The One Show. As in the previous series, the celebrities did not know who would be their professional partner until they were introduced to each other at the Launch Show. McFly drummer Harry Judd and Aliona Vilani won the show on 17 December 2011. Vilani also became the third female professional to reach two consecutive finals, after Lilia Kopylova and Erin Boag, having come second with Matt Baker in 2010."
