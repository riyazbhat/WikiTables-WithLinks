  "intro": "A national third tier of Scottish league football was first established in the 1923-24 season, as Division Three, it only lasted for two full seasons due to financial difficulties. There was again a third tier league in 1946-47 with the C Division, which also included reserve teams of the clubs from the divisions above. Division C operated as a national competition for the first three seasons thereafter it was split into two regional sections until season 1954-55 when the third tier was again abolished. A third tier was reestablished in 1975-76 season, when a division known as the Second Division was set up. Its status within the Scottish football league system league system changed in season 1998-99 when clubs from the top tier (Premier Division) broke away from the Scottish Football League to form the Scottish Premier League. The Second Division was still the third tier of the Scottish league system, but became the second level of the Scottish Football League rather than the third. In 2013, the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League merged to form the Scottish Professional Football League, with the third tier becoming known as the Scottish League One."
