  "intro": "The 2014 Ladbrokes World Darts Championship was the 21st World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event took place at the Alexandra Palace, London between 13 December 2013 and 1 January 2014. Phil Taylor was the defending champion, having won his 16th title in 2013, but he lost 4-3 to Michael Smith in the second round. Michael van Gerwen won his first World Championship by defeating Peter Wright 7-4 in the final. He became the sixth winner of the event and, at the age of 24, the youngest. The result also saw him replace Taylor as the new world number one. A new record of 603 maximum 180 scores were made during the championship, beating the previous best of 588 set in 2012. For the first time in PDC history there was no Englishman in the final."
