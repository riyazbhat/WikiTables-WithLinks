  "intro": "The 2013 French Road Cycling Cup was the 22nd edition of the French Road Cycling Cup. Compared to the previous edition, the Fl\u00e8che d'Emeraude was replaced by the Tour de la Somme. The defending champion from 2012 was Samuel Dumoulin, who won for a second consecutive time after a third place in the final event allowed him to overtake Bryan Coquard and Anthony Geslin in the overall standings. Bryan Coquard still won the youth classification, while FDJ.fr won the teams competition."
