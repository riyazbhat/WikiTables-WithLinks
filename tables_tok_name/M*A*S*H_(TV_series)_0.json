Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run , and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used . The writers found creating so many names difficult , and used names from elsewhere ; for example , characters on the seventh season were named after the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers . [ 1 ]",

  "intro": "M*A*S*H (an acronym for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) is an American war comedy-drama television series that aired on CBS from 1972 to 1983. It was developed by Larry Gelbart as the first spin-off series adapted from the 1970 feature film M*A*S*H, which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker's 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors. The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War (1950-53). The show's title sequence features an instrumental-only version of Suicide Is Painless, the original film's theme song. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. The television series is the best-known of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history."
