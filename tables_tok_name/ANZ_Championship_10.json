  "intro": "The ANZ Championship (also known non-commercially as the Trans-Tasman Netball League) was the premier netball league in Australia and New Zealand. The competition was held annually between April and July, comprising 69 matches played over 17 weeks. It was contested by ten teams, five from Australia and five from New Zealand. The competition was administered by Trans Tasman Netball League, which was formed as a joint venture by the netball governing bodies of both countries. ANZ Bank was naming sponsors of the competition since its inaugural season. The ANZ Championship was launched in 2008 as a successor to the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in Australia and the National Bank Cup in New Zealand, both of which were retired after 2007. The ANZ Championship saw netball become a semi-professional sport in both countries, with increased media coverage and player salaries. The final champions before the competition's folding were the Queensland Firebirds, who defeated the New South Wales Swifts in the grand final of the 2016 season, becoming the only team to win the tournament 3 times and the only team to win back-to-back titles. 2016 was the last season of the competition. It was replaced by separate Australian and New Zealand leagues in 2017, Suncorp Super Netball and the ANZ Premiership respectively."
