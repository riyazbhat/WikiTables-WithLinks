  "section_text": "The SSL 1300 had a series of failures in 2001 . Since that time , electrical failures ( Intelsat 7 , PAS 6 , Galaxy 27 ) and failure of the satellite 's solar panels to properly deploy ( Estrela do Sul 1 , Telstar 14R , Intelsat 19 ) are recurring issues .",
  "uid": "LS-1300_1",
  "intro": "The SSL 1300, previously the LS-1300 and the FS-1300, is a satellite bus produced by SSL (company). Total broadcast power ranges from 5 to 25 kW, and the platform can accommodate from 12 to 150 transponders. The SSL 1300 is a modular platform and SSL no longer reports designators for sub-versions, such as: 1300E, 1300HL, 1300S, 1300X. First available in the late 1980s, the SSL 1300 platform underwent revision multiple times over its design life, all the while remaining a popular communications platform. The earliest models provided 5,000 RF watts of transmitter power, weighed 5,500 kg, and required a 4-meter diameter launch fairing. Newer models provide double that, approximately 10,000 RF watts of transmitter power, weigh 6,700 kg, and require a 5-meter diameter launch fairing. SSL stated that they would use electric propulsion for North-South station keeping for the first time on the MBSat in 2004. The subsystem was supplied by International Space Technologies Inc and used Fakel's Hall thrusters and American and European propellant supply and electronics. According to Moog-ISP, the SSL 1300 platform uses its bipropellant thrusters. In September 2015 SSL announced that it had delivered 100 satellites based on the SSL 1300 platform. There are more SSL 1300's currently providing service on orbit than any other model communications satellite."
