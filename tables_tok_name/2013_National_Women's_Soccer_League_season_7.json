  "intro": "The 2013 National Women's Soccer League season was the inaugural season of the National Women's Soccer League, the top division of women's soccer in the United States. Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, Women's Professional Soccer (2009-2011) and the Women's United Soccer Association (2001-2003), this was the seventh overall season of FIFA and USSF-sanctioned top division women's soccer in the United States. The league was (and is) operated by the United States Soccer Federation and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing was provided by the Canadian Soccer Association and the Mexican Football Federation. All three national federations paid the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations. The league started on April 13 with FC Kansas City hosting Portland Thorns FC. The last regular season matches were played on August 18, followed by postseason playoffs which culminated with a one-game final on August 31. In the final, Portland Thorns FC defeated the Western New York Flash 2-0 to win the inaugural NWSL Championship."
