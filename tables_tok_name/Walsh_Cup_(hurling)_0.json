The venues of Walsh Cup matches are decided during the draw by the first named team 's home venue [ 5 ] Because the early stages of the Walsh Cup do not attract large crowds , matches are often held in smaller stadia within each county . The Walsh Cup final has , in recent years , been played at the GAA 's headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin , as part of a double header with the O'Byrne Cup .

  "intro": "The Walsh Cup (Irish: Corn Bhreatnach) is an annual hurling competition staged in Ireland by the Leinster Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) since 1954. Contested by the top county teams from the provinces of Leinster, Ulster and Connacht, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage, followed by a knockout stage. Sponsored by Bord na M\u00f3na, it is therefore officially known as the Bord na M\u00f3na Walsh Cup. Prior to 2018, third-level colleges also competed. The Walsh Cup is part of a series of GAA tournaments known as The Bord na M\u00f3na Leinster GAA Series, along with the Kehoe Cup (second-tier hurling teams) and the O'Byrne Cup (Gaelic football). The money generated by these competitions helps address hardship suffered by players and ordinary members of the GAA in Leinster. This scheme is the only one of its kind offered by a provincial GAA council. Apart from this, the competitions provide an opportunity for the county teams to prepare for the upcoming National Hurling League. Seven teams currently participate in the Walsh Cup, most of which are from the province of Leinster. The tournament has been won at least once by nine different teams, six of which have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Kilkenny, who have won the competition 19 times."
