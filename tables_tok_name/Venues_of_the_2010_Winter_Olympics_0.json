  "section_text": "Whistler Olympic Park ski jumps at Callaghan Valley The Richmond Olympic Oval The largest competition venue was Canada Hockey Place , with a capacity of just under 19,000 spectators . For the first time , Olympic games were played on a narrower NHL-sized ice rink , measuring 61 by 26 metres ( 200 ft \u00d7 85 ft ) , instead of the international size of 61 m \u00d7 30 m ( 200 ft \u00d7 98 ft ) . This change saved an expected $ 10 million ( CAD ) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games . [ 12 ] This arena , as well as the second-largest venue of Vancouver 2010 , Pacific Coliseum , were pre-existing and required minimal renovation in preparation for the Olympics . Of the newly constructed venues for the Games , the Whistler Sliding Centre was the largest , with space for 12,000 spectators to observe the luge , skeleton and bobsled events . Three venues used in the Games were outside Vancouver and Whistler : Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver , the Richmond Olympic Oval in Richmond , and UBC Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre on the University Endowment Lands .",

  "intro": "For the 2010 Winter Olympics, a total of ten sports venues were used, seven in Vancouver (including BC Place), and three in Whistler. The 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games were held in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The Olympics ran from February 12 to February 28, 2010, and the Paralympics from March 12 to March 21, during which nine competition venues were used, spread across Vancouver, Whistler, and the neighbouring areas of West Vancouver and Richmond. The majority of ice sport events were held in Vancouver, while Whistler, which normally serves as a ski resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and Whistler, provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games. In its 2002 evaluation of Vancouver's bid during the bidding process for the 2010 Games, the Evaluation Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) highlighted the number and quality of existing competition and training facilities as one of the bid's strengths. Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for use during the Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government. According to CEO John Furlong, VANOC started our venue construction as early as possible. Construction on Cypress Mountain, the first new competition venue to be completed, began in March 2006 and was completed only eight months later, three years ahead of the start of the Games. By December 2007, all three competition venues at Whistler were completed and open for training and testing. Final construction was completed in February 2009, and sporting events were scheduled at the venues to ensure that they would be adequately tested before hosting the Olympic events."
