The front gate of the Stockholm Olympic Stadium , which was built for the 1912 Games Twelve sports venues were used in the 1912 Summer Olympics . This marked the first time that more than one venue would be used for the football tournament , which has been the case ever since . [ citation needed ] Stockholm Olympic Stadium served as one of the equestrian venues for the 1956 Summer Olympics . R\u00e5sunda Stadium served as a venue for the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women 's World Cup . In the initial bid document it was identified that a new stadium would be needed , initially envisaged as being located in the \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds . In order to save funds , it was expected that only one of the stadium 's stands would be permanent , with the other three made of wood and dismantled following the Games . The cost of that stadium was estimated at 235,000 Kronor . [ 3 ] Arrangements were made with the individual national committees to provide the use of \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds and Traneberg . [ 13 ] The cycling road race was held around M\u00e4laren , the third largest lake in Sweden . [ 14 ] The water events , including the swimming and the rowing , were held at Djurg\u00e5rdsbrunnsviken , where a stadium was built . Kakn\u00e4s was already used as a shooting range , but alterations were needed to accommodate shooting events . Although it was not used as the Olympic stadium as originally intended , \u00d6stermalm hosted the lawn tennis and fencing competitions after a tennis pavilion was moved there from another location . [ 15 ] Five other locations were considered in addition to the \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds to locate the Olympic Stadium . The Stockholm Olympic Stadium was built on the site of the former Stockholm Athletic Grounds in order to retain the other locations for other uses during the Games . By placing it to the north of the city , the Olympic Stadium was within the immediate vicinity of other pre-existing sporting venues . Initial funding was given to the sum of 400,000 Kr for a timber stadium but Torben Grut , [ 16 ] the architect , also drew up alternative plans for a stone stadium . Following discussions with the Swedish Central Association for the Application of Athletics , it was decided that the stone version should be built , and further funds were made available through a national lottery once guarantees were made that no further funding was to be asked for in order to build the stadium . [ 17 ] However it was found that the original estimate for the stone stadium would still be too expensive , and the plans were once more modified in order to simplify the design and reduce costs . An agreement was entered into with a contractor on 2 November 1910 that it would be transferred complete by 25 May 1912 . [ 18 ]",

  "intro": "The 1912 Summer Olympics (Swedish: Olympiska sommarspelen 1912), officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Stockholm, Sweden, between 5 May and 22 July 1912. Twenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with Japan's debut, the first time an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909. The games were the first to have art competitions, women's diving, women's swimming, and the first to feature both the decathlon and the new pentathlon, both won by Jim Thorpe. Electric timing was introduced in athletics, while the host country disallowed boxing. Figure skating was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the Nordic Games. United States won the most gold medals (25), while Sweden won the most medals overall (65)."
