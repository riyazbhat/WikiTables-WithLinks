See also : State school \u00a7 Australia Also called state schools or public schools , government schools educate approximately two-thirds of all school students in Australia . [ 42 ] If a student elects to attend a government school , they are required to attend a school within their local school district unless the student has dispensation to attend another school , usually approved on the basis of academic merit , specialisation , or other reasons , such as a student disability . Government schools are run by the respective state government agency . [ 44 ] They offer free education ; however , many government schools ask parents to pay a contribution fee and a materials and services charge [ 46 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] for stationery , textbooks , sports , uniforms , school camps and other schooling costs that are not covered under government funding . In 2010 the additional cost for schooling was estimated to be on average $ 316 per year per child . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Government schools may be further categorised into open or comprehensive schools , selective , special , and specialist schools ; all defined below . In 2009 the Western Australia government introduced Independent Public Schools to describe a government school that , while a part of the state education system , was granted a higher degree of decision-making authority than a regular government school . [ 88 ] A similar reform was introduced in Queensland and , as of December 2018 , 250 government schools commenced as independent public schools in Queensland . [ 89 ] In February 2014 the then Federal Education Minister , Christopher Pyne , announced a $ 70 million Independent Public Schools Initiative to support 1,500 Australian government schools to become more autonomous . [ 90 ] Government hospital schools are located at some major hospitals and provide access to tuition for students who have extended stay in hospitals . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Across Australia , the Federal Department of Education sets the overall national policy and direction for education in Australia . The following state and territory government departments are responsible for the administration of education within their respective jurisdictions :",
  "uid": "Education_in_Australia_1",
  "intro": "Education in Australia encompasses the sectors of early childhood education (preschool) and primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (high schools), tertiary education (universities, TAFE colleges, and vocational education and training providers) and adult education (referred to as adult and community education or ACE). Regulation and funding of education is primarily the responsibility of the States and territories, however the Australian Government also plays a funding role. Education in Australia is compulsory between the ages of five or six and fifteen, sixteen or seventeen, depending on the State or territory and date of birth. For primary and secondary education, government schools educate approximately 60 percent of Australian students, with approximately 40 percent in non-government schools. At the tertiary level, the majority of Australia's universities are public, and student fees are subsidised through a student loan program where payment becomes due when debtors reach a certain income level. Underpinned by the Australian Qualifications Framework, implemented in 1995, Australia has adopted a national system of qualifications, encompassing higher education, vocational education and training (VET), and school-based education. For primary and secondary schools, a national Australian Curriculum has been progressively developed and implemented since 2010. Australia is a leading global provider of education to international students; and, after the United States and the United Kingdom, is ranked as the third largest provider of international education. Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019. The Education Index, published with the UN's Human Development Index in 2018, based on data from 2017, listed Australia as 0.929, the second-highest in the world. In 1966 the Australian Government signed the Convention against Discrimination in Education, that aimed to combat discrimination and racial segregation in the field of education."
