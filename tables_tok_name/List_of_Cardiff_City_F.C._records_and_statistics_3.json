After spending a decade in the Southern Football League, Cardiff joined the Football League in 1920. Since then, the club has played in all four professional divisions of the Football League, spending 11 seasons in the top tier since its formation. Cardiff have also reached the final of the FA Cup on three occasions, winning the trophy in the 1927 final, and the League Cup once. The team currently play in the second tier of the English league system, the EFL Championship. Billy Hardy is the club's record appearance holder having played in 590 first team matches between 1911 and 1931. Phil Dwyer made the most appearances for the club in the Football League. The club's goalscoring record is held by Len Davies who scored 179 times between 1919 and 1931. Davies is one of only eight players to have scored 100 or more goals in the club's history. The list encompasses the major honours won by Cardiff City, records set by the club, its managers and players, and details of its performance in European competition.
