  "intro": "The UNLV Rebels are the intercollegiate athletics teams that represent the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). The Rebels compete in the NCAA Division I (Football Bowl Subdivision for college football) as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The school's colors are scarlet and gray. It was founded in 1958 for basketball in Paradise, Nevada. Some of the Rebels teams use variations of the team name for their individual sport, such as the Runnin' Rebels for men's basketball and the Hustlin' Rebels for the baseball team. The 1990 Runnin' Rebels basketball team defeated Duke University 103-73, to win the NCAA National Championship, UNLV's first Division I National Championship in one of the three major sports. The UNLV golf team won the school's second team National Championship in 1998. The Rebels also have won six individual national championships: two men's golf, two men's tennis, and two women's track and field."
