  "section_title": "NPR News and Classical Network",
  "section_text": "The NPR News and Classical Network primarily broadcasts classical music , , while serving as the network 's outlet for national NPR and other public radio programming to complement the local Ideas Network schedules . With NPR 's increasing news-heavy direction though , the classical music that makes up the network has been reduced to non-prime periods on the network , with NPR 's programming airing in morning rush and afternoon drive , along with the evening . Music is programmed locally during daytime hours , with network programming from Classical 24 being carried in late evenings and overnight . These programs include NPR 's Morning Edition , All Things Considered , Fresh Air and Weekend Edition , as well as APM 's Marketplace ( it also carries Morning Marketplace during Morning Edition ) , the BBC World Service 's Newshour , along with Live from Here . The network also carries weekend jazz , folk and world music programming - including Higher Ground , hosted by Dr. Jonathan Overby on Saturday nights ( this program is also heard on WPR 's Milwaukee-based Ideas Network Station WHAD ) . Other forms of music such as blues , new-age , and Native American music can be heard regionally . A few Ideas Network stations in areas not served by this network carry the above programs in place of the master Ideas Network schedule . The flagship station of the NPR News and Classical Network is WERN in Madison .",
