The film stars Juhi Chawla, Arshad Warsi, Irrfan Khan, Suresh Menon and Rajpal Yadav in lead roles while Shahrukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan appear in item numbers. Music of the film is by Rajesh Roshan. Even though the film is scripted by Ashwani Dhir, the screenplay is an (uncredited) adaptation of the Malayalam film Mookilla Rajyathu, which in turn was an (uncredited) adaptation of the 1989 Hollywood film The Dream Team, written originally by John Connolly and David Loucka."
