Beijing Capital International Airport has been the busiest airport in Asia since 2009. The tables also shows the percentage change in total passenger traffic over last year. Asian airports are those that are located in the 48 countries and 6 dependent states as defined by UN and fall within the Asian region. Airports in Moscow and Istanbul are located in the European part of their respective countries and so are not included in this list. As of 2018, China has 20 airports in the top 50, while Japan has five, India has four, South Korea has three and Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, UAE, Thailand and Turkey (Asian part) have two each.
