  "intro": "These are lists of active and all-time Major League Soccer (MLS) club post-season series win, MLS Cup Playoffs and MLS Cup droughts. Those teams which have never made it in club history are listed by the season that they entered the league. Among the current 24 MLS teams, 11 have never won the MLS Cup and 13 have never won the Supporters' Shield. Among those clubs which have won the MLS Cup, the longest MLS Cup title drought is that of the Chicago Fire, who have not won the post-season honor since winning the 1998 MLS Cup. The longest Supporters' Shield drought is Sporting Kansas City, who last won the title in the 2000. The only teams that have never qualified for the post-season tournament are Orlando City SC, who debuted in 2015 and FC Cincinnati, who debuted in 2019."
