  "intro": "The Game Boy portable system has a library of games, which were released in plastic ROM cartridges. The Game Boy first launched in Japan on April 21, 1989 with Super Mario Land, Alleyway, Baseball and Yakuman. For the North American launches, Tetris and Tennis were also featured, while Yakuman was never released outside of Japan. The last games to be published for the system were the Japan-only titles Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Kanji no Tatsujin and Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Keisan no Tatsujin, which were both released on March 30, 2001. This list is initially organized alphabetically by their English titles, or, when Japan-exclusive, their r\u014dmaji transliterations; however, it is also possible to sort each column individually by clicking the square icon at the top of each column. The Game Boy system is not region locked, meaning that software purchased in any region can be played on any region's hardware."
