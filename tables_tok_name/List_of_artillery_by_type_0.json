  "section_text": "A recoilless gun or recoilless rifle ( RCL ) is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile than would be practical to fire from a recoiling weapon of comparable size . Technically , only devices that use a rifled barrel are recoilless rifles . Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns . This distinction is often lost , and both are often called recoilless rifles . Normally used for anti-tank roles , the first effective system of this kind was developed during World War II to provide infantry with light , cheap and easily deployable weapon that does not require extensive training in gunnery . The near complete lack of recoil allows some versions to be shoulder-fired , but the majority are mounted on light tripods and are intended to be easily carried by a soldier .",
  "uid": "List_of_artillery_by_type_0",
  "intro": "A list of artillery catalogues types of weapons found in batteries of national armed forces' artillery units. Some weapons used by the infantry units, known as infantry support weapons, are often misidentified as artillery weapons because of their use and performance characteristics, sometimes known colloquially as the infantryman's artillery which has been particularly applied to mortars. The distinguishing feature of infantry support weapons from artillery weapons is in the unit that provides the personnel for the weapon crew. The list does not differentiate between guns and cannons although some designations use one word or the other. The word cannon is of Latin origin, borrowed into the English language from the French, while gun appears to be of German language origin and is found in earlier use in England. There is almost universal use of gunner in the English language to refer to artillery personnel, and not the French term cannonier. Some English speaking armies do use the originally French term bombardier as a rank in artillery units."
