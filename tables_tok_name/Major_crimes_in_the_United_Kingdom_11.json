Skeletal remains of two further young women who went missing in 1991 were subsequently found at his former home in Margate . Tobin was convicted of the murder of Vicky Hamilton in December 2008 , when his minimum sentence was increased to 30 years , and of the murder of Dinah McNicol in December 2009 . He is now being investigated for other unsolved cases of murder dating back to the 1960s"
