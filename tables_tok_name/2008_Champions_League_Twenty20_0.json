  "intro": "The 2008 Champions League Twenty20 was scheduled to be the first edition of the Champions League Twenty20, an international club cricket tournament. It was due to be held in India between December 3 and December 10, 2008, where the winners were to earn around US$6 million. The bombing attacks in Mumbai just one week prior to the tournament resulted in its postponement. It was proposed that the tournament be held in early 2009, though dates for its rearrangement could not be found and the tournament was cancelled on December 12, 2008. The league was planned and successfully executed as the 2009 Champions League Twenty20."
