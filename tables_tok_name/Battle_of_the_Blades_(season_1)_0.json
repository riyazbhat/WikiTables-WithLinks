  "intro": "The first season of Battle of the Blades debuted on CBC on October 4, 2009. Eight former NHL ice hockey players were paired with eight professional female figure skaters. Ron MacLean and Kurt Browning were the hosts for this season. Pairs figure skater and Emmy Award winning choreographer Sandra Bezic was the head judge, with Olympic figure skating champion Dick Button being the other regular judge. Each week had one rotating guest judge. Also, there was a set theme each week that the couples must perform in. The elimination format is that the couples are scored on their Sunday night performance, but only as a reference guide for the viewers to vote on. The bottom two couples are based solely on the lowest number of viewer votes. On Monday, the bottom two couples are revealed and they skate their Sunday night program once more in the Skate-Off and are then scored by the judges. The couple with the lower judges score from their Monday night performance is then eliminated."
