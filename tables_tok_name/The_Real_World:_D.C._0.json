It is the fifth season of The Real World to be filmed in the Mid-Atlantic States region of the United States. The season featured eight people who lived in a house in Dupont Circle. Washington, D.C. was officially announced as the location for the newest season on June 10, 2009. Filming began on July 2, 2009 and completed on October 12, 2009. The season's December 30, 2009 premiere was watched by 1.9 million viewers. The March 31, 2010 season finale was watched by 1.1 million viewers, the record low at the time for a season finale of The Real World. The finale was immediately followed with a reunion special, The Real World: Washington D.C. Reunion. Overall the season averaged 1.5 million viewers a week and consisted of 14 episodes. According to MTV's President of Programming, Tony DiSanto, The charged atmosphere of Washington D.C., the center of our country's social and political change, will provide an electric setting for this next season of The Real World. We are thrilled to be filming our classic franchise in the heart of where history is being made . it adds a whole new dimension to the great characters and drama our viewers expect and love from The Real World."
