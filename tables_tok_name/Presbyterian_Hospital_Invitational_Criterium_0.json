  "intro": "The Presbyterian Hospital Invitational Criterium, or Charlotte Criterium, is an annual criterium bicycle race along an 1.2 miles (2 km) course located in Uptown, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. With the inaugural race occurring in 2004, this was known as the Bank of America Criterium through the 2006 race, when the name and sponsorship was changed to its current name for the 2007 event. Its $125,000 purse is the largest for this type of event in the United States. The race serves as a benefit for the Brain Tumor Fund of the Carolinas, and is an officially sanctioned race as part of the USA CRITS Tour."
