  "section_text": "Main article : Asteroid moon Unlike the planets and dwarf planets , relatively few moons orbiting asteroids have been named . Among them are the following :",
  "uid": "Naming_of_moons_1",
  "intro": "The naming of moons has been the responsibility of the International Astronomical Union's committee for Planetary System Nomenclature since 1973. That committee is known today as the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN). Prior to its formation, the names of satellites have had varying histories. The choice of names is often determined by a satellite's discoverer; however, historically some satellites were not given names for many years after their discovery; for instance, Titan was discovered by Huygens in 1655, but was not named until 1847, almost two centuries later. Before the IAU assumed responsibility for astronomical nomenclature, only twenty-five satellites had been given names that were in wide use and are still used. Since then, names have been given to 134 additional satellites: 57 satellites of Jupiter, 43 of Saturn, 22 of Uranus, 12 of Neptune, 5 of Pluto, 1 of Eris, and 2 of Haumea. The number will continue to rise as current satellite discoveries are documented and new satellites are discovered. At the IAU General Assembly in July 2004, the WGPSN suggested it may become advisable to not name small satellites, as CCD technology makes it possible to discover satellites as small as 1 km in diameter. Until 2013, names were applied to all moons discovered, regardless of size. Since then, some small moons have not received names."
