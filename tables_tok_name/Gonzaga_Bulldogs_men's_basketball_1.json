A fourth , Oumar Ballo , was to have made his Gonzaga debut in the 2019\u201320 season , but was not academically cleared to play by the NCAA and was redshirted that season .

  "intro": "The Gonzaga Bulldogs are an intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Gonzaga University. The school competes in the West Coast Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Gonzaga Bulldogs play home basketball games at the McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane, Washington on the university campus. Gonzaga has had 15 of its players receive the WCC Player of the Year award, and two players, Frank Burgess in 1961 with 32.4 points per game, and Adam Morrison in 2006 with 28.1 points per game, have led the nation in scoring. Adam Morrison was named the Co-National Player of the year for the 2005-06 season. Since the mid-1990s, Gonzaga has established itself as a major basketball power in a mid-major conference. They have been to every NCAA Tournament since 1999, a year in which they made a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight, and have appeared in every final AP poll since the 2008-09 season, as well as being ranked in the past 71 polls (Since Preseason 2016) which is good for the 39th longest streak in Mens Basketball history. They have also appeared in all but one WCC conference title game since 1995, and in every conference title game since 1998, winning 16 of them. This culminated in 2016-17, when the Bulldogs went to their first Final Four in school history, advancing all the way to the national championship game."
