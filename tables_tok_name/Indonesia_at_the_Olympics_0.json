  "intro": "Indonesia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for 1964, due to controversy around the Games of the New Emerging Forces, and 1980, when they participated in the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. Indonesia has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games. The National Olympic Committee for Indonesia was created in 1946 and recognized in 1952. Indonesian athletes have won a total of 32 medals, nineteen in badminton, twelve in weightlifting and one in archery. Among the countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia ranks second in terms of both the number of gold medals (7) and medals overall (32), trailing only Thailand, who has a total of 33 medals, with nine of them being golds. Archers Lilies Handayani, Nurfitriyana Saiman and Kusuma Wardhani gained the republic's first ever podium finish, a silver medal, in the women's team event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Future married couple Susi Susanti and Alan Budikusuma won the nation's first 2 gold medals in the badminton women's and men's singles events respectively at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Barcelona 1992 was also the only Games in which Indonesia won 2 gold medals. Since then, Indonesia has won a single gold medal at every subsequent Summer Olympics, all in badminton, with the exception of the 2012 London Olympics where Indonesia failed to garner any gold medals. The last gold medalists were Lilyana Natsir and Tontowi Ahmad in the mixed doubles event of badminton at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics."
