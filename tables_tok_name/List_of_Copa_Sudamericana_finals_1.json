  "intro": "The Copa Sudamericana is an annual association football tournament established in 2002. The competition is organized by the South American Football Confederation, or CONMEBOL, and it is contested by 39 clubs from its member association. From 2004 to 2008, clubs from the CONCACAF were invited to participate. The finals are contested over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium. San Lorenzo won the inaugural competition in 2002, defeating Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. Ten clubs have won the competition since its inception. Boca Juniors and Independiente hold the record for the most victories, winning the competition two times. Boca Juniors is also the only club to have successfully defended their title. Teams from Argentina have won the competition the most, with eight wins among them. The current champion is Independiente del Valle, who defeated Col\u00f3n in the 2019 edition."
