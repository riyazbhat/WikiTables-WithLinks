  "intro": "The 2007-08 season was Leeds United F.C. 's first ever season in the third tier of English football after relegation from the Championship the previous season. They finished in the play-offs in League One. Dennis Wise started the season as manager, but left the club in January 2008 to join Newcastle as Executive Director of Football. Wise was replaced just days later with former Leeds captain, Gary McAllister. In pre-season, the club were hit with a 15-point deduction for exiting administration without a CVA. However, the team won their first seven games and effectively eliminated the 15-point deduction. As the season progressed, results slipped, but the team still finished 5th in the league - qualifying them for the play-offs. In the play-off semi-finals, the club beat Carlisle over two legs, booking them a place at Wembley in the final. However, dreams were shattered when the team were beaten 1-0 by Doncaster, resigning the club to a second season in League One. Jermaine Beckford had an impressive first full season with the club, being named League One Player of the Year and scoring over 20 goals in the process. The club recorded the highest attendance in the country outside the Premier League, in the 2-1 victory against Gillingham in May."
