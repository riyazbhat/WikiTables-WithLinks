  "intro": "Cornwall 1, known as Tribute Cornwall 1 for sponsorship reasons, is an English level nine rugby union league for clubs based in Cornwall. It has been running continually since 1987-88. The champions are promoted to the Tribute Cornwall/Devon league, and the runner-up plays the second team in Tribute Devon 1, with the winning team gaining promotion. One or two teams are usually relegated to Tribute Cornwall 2. Saltash are the most successful team having won the league on five occasions and have been runner-up three times; they currently play in Tribute Cornwall/Devon. From the 2016-17 season Cornwall 1 and Cornwall 2 were amalgamated to create the Tribute Cornwall League with fifteen teams playing each other once in a first phase. After Christmas the teams split into two leagues with the top eight playing in Cornwall One and the remainder playing in Cornwall Two. Hayle won both phase one and phase two, winning the title with two matches to play. They are promoted to the Cornwall/Devon league, following their relegation from that league in 2015-16. Newquay Hornets finished in second place and were due to play their counterparts from Devon, Torrington for the second promotion spot. Newquay did not want promotion and declined to play the match. For the 2018-19 season Cornwall 1 and Cornwall 2 would revert to being two separate divisions."
