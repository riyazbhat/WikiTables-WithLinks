  "/wiki/Richard_III_(play)": "Richard III is a historical play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written around 1593 . It depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England . The play is grouped among the histories in the First Folio and is most often classified as such . Occasionally , however , as in the quarto edition , it is termed a tragedy . Richard III concludes Shakespeare 's first tetralogy ( also containing Henry VI parts 1-3 ) . It is the second longest play in the Shakespearean canon after Hamlet and is the longest of the First Folio , whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart . The play is often abridged ; for example , certain peripheral characters are removed entirely . In such instances , extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters ' relationships . A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences would be familiar with his Henry VI plays and frequently made indirect references to events in them , such as Richard 's murder of Henry VI or the defeat of Henry 's wife , Margaret .",
  "/wiki/Edward_V_of_England": "Edward V ( 2 November 1470 ) succeeded his father , Edward IV , as King of England and Lord of Ireland upon the latter 's death on 9 April 1483 . Edward V was never crowned , and his brief reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle and Lord Protector , the Duke of Gloucester , who deposed him to reign as Richard III on 26 June 1483 ; this was confirmed by the Act entitled Titulus Regius , which denounced any further claims through his father 's heirs . Edward and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury , Duke of York , were the Princes in the Tower who disappeared after being sent to heavily guarded royal lodgings in the Tower of London . Responsibility for their deaths is widely attributed to Richard III , but the lack of any solid evidence and conflicting contemporary accounts allow for other possibilities .",
