  "/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index": "The Volcanic Explosivity Index ( VEI ) is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions . It was devised by Chris Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self at the University of Hawaii in 1982 . Volume of products , eruption cloud height , and qualitative observations ( using terms ranging from gentle to mega-colossal ) are used to determine the explosivity value . The scale is open-ended with the largest volcanoes in history given magnitude 8 . A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions , defined as less than of tephra ejected ; and 8 representing a mega-colossal explosive eruption that can eject ( 240 cubic miles ) of tephra and have a cloud column height of over . The scale is logarithmic , with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria , with the exception of between VEI-0 , VEI-1 and VEI-2 .",
  "/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79": "Mount Vesuvius , a stratovolcano in modern-day Italy , erupted in 79 AD in one of the deadliest volcanic eruptions in European history , which was witnessed and documented by Pliny the Younger , a Roman administrator and poet . Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km ( 21 mi ) , ejecting molten rock , pulverized pumice and hot ash at 1.5 million tons per second , ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings . Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits , the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum . After archeological excavations revealed much about the lives of the inhabitants , the area became a major tourist attraction , and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and part of Vesuvius National Park . The total population of both cities was 16,000-20,000 . The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum , however the death toll is still unclear . The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruptions , characterized by eruption columns of hot gases and ash exploding into the stratosphere , although the event also included pyroclastic flows associated with Pelean eruptions .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea . In addition , the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea .",
  "/wiki/Hatepe_eruption": "The Hatepe eruption , named for the Hatepe Plinian pumice tephra layer , sometimes referred to as the Taupo eruption and dated to either around 180 or 233 AD was Taupo Volcano 's most recent major eruption . It is considered New Zealand 's largest eruption during the last 20,000 years . The eruption ejected some of material , of which was ejected in a few minutes . This makes it one of the most violent eruptions in the last 5000 years , comparable to the Minoan eruption in the 2nd millennium BC , the 946 eruption of Paektu Mountain and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora . The resulting ash turned the sky red over Rome and China .",
  "/wiki/Ring_of_Fire": "The Ring of Fire ( also known as the Rim of Fire or the Circum-Pacific belt ) is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur . In a large horseshoe shape , it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches , volcanic arcs , and volcanic belts and plate movements . It has 452 volcanoes ( more than 75% of the world 's active and dormant volcanoes ) . About 90% of the world 's earthquakes and about 81% of the world 's largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire . All but three of the world 's 25 largest volcanic eruptions of the last 11,700 years occurred at volcanoes in the Ring of Fire . The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics : the movement and collisions of lithospheric plates , especially subduction in the northern portion . The western portion is more complex , with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific Plate from the Mariana Islands , the Philippines , Bougainville , Tonga , and New Zealand .",
  "/wiki/Baekdu_Mountain": "Paektu Mountain , also known as Baekdu Mountain , and in China as Changbai Mountain ( traditional Chinese : \u9577\u767d\u5c71 ; simplified Chinese : \u957f\u767d\u5c71 Ch\u00e1ngb\u00e1ish\u0101n , Korean : \ubc31\ub450\uc0b0 Paektusan ) , is an active stratovolcano on the Chinese-North Korean border . At 2,744 m ( 9,003 ft ) , it is the highest mountain of the Changbai and Baekdudaegan ranges . Koreans assign a mythical quality to the volcano and its caldera lake , considering it to be their country 's spiritual home . It is the highest mountain in North Korea , the Korean Peninsula , and Northeast China . A large crater lake , called Heaven Lake , is in the caldera atop the mountain . The caldera was formed by the VEI 7 Millennium or Tianchi eruption of 946 , which erupted about 100-120 km3 ( 24-29 cu mi ) of tephra . This was one of the largest and most violent eruptions in the last 5,000 years ( alongside the Minoan eruption , the Hatepe eruption of Lake Taupo in around AD 180 , the 1257 eruption of Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani , and the 1815 eruption of Tambora ) . The mountain plays an important mythological and cultural role in the societies and civil religions of both contemporary Korean states , for instance , it is mentioned in both of their national anthems and is depicted on the national emblem of North Korea .",
  "/wiki/1257_eruption_of_Mount_Samalas": "The Samalas volcano erupted in 1257 on the Indonesian island of Lombok . The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7 , making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the current Holocene epoch . It created eruption columns reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and pyroclastic flows that buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighbouring island of Sumbawa . The flows destroyed human habitations , including the city of Pamatan , which was the capital of a kingdom on Lombok . Ash from the eruption fell as far as away in Java ; the volcano deposited more than of rocks and ash . The eruption was witnessed by people who recorded it on the Babad Lombok , a document written on palm leaves . It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak . Later volcanic activity created more volcanic centres in the caldera , including the Barujari cone , which remains active . The aerosols injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface , cooling the atmosphere for several years and leading to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere , although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated . The eruption may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age , a centuries-long cold period during the last thousand years . Before the site of the eruption was known , an examination of ice cores around the world had found a large spike in sulfate deposition around 1257 , providing strong evidence of a large volcanic eruption having occurred somewhere in the world . In 2013 , scientists linked the historical records about Mount Samalas to these spikes .",

Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt , it is the product of the subduction of the oceanic Nazca tectonic plate beneath the continental part of the South American tectonic plate at a rate of 10.3 centimetres per year ( 4.1 in/year ) . Huaynaputina is a large volcanic crater , lacking an identifiable mountain profile , with an outer stratovolcano and three younger volcanic vents . The vents of Huaynaputina form a north-northwest-south-southeast trend . The volcano erupted several times during the Holocene , the largest eruption took place in the year 1600 . The 1600 eruption was the largest historical eruption in South America , measuring 6 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . It occurred on 19 February and continued with a series of events into March . Witnessed by the people of the city of Arequipa , its impact in the region was severe , wiping out vegetation and burying the surroundings with 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) of volcanic rock ; it also damaged infrastructure and economic resources . The eruption had significant effects on Earth 's climate , decreasing temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere , causing floods , famines and cold waves in numerous places , and depositing several million tons of acid . The climate disruption caused social upheaval in many countries such as Russia and may have played a role in the onset of the Little Ice Age . Huaynaputina has not erupted since 1600 . Today there are fumaroles in Huaynaputina 's amphitheatre , and hot springs occur in the region , some of which have been associated with Huaynaputina .",
  "/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa": "The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa ( Indonesian : Krakatau ) in the Sunda Strait began on the afternoon of Sunday , 26 August 1883 - with origins as early as May of that year - and peaked on the late morning of Monday , 27 August 1883 , when over 70% of the island of Krakatoa and its surrounding archipelago were destroyed as it collapsed into a caldera . The eruption was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history and explosions were so violent that they were heard 3,110 kilometres ( 1,930 mi ) away in Perth , Western Australia , and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius , 4,800 kilometres ( 3,000 mi ) away . At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the tsunamis it created . Significant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano 's eruption . Additional seismic activity was reported to have continued until February 1884 , though reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by Rogier Verbeek 's investigation into the eruption .",

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912 .",
  "/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens": "The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was a series of volcanic explosions and pyroclastic flows from Mount St. Helens in Skamania County , U.S. state of Washington , that began on March 27 , 1980 . It initiated as a series of phreatic blasts from the summit then escalated on May 18 , 1980 , as a major explosive eruption . The eruption , which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 5 , was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California . It has often been declared the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history . The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes , caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain 's north slope . An earthquake at 8:32:17 a.m. PDT ( UTC\u22127 ) on Sunday , May 18 , 1980 , caused the entire weakened north face to slide away , creating the largest landslide ever recorded . This allowed the partly molten , high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock , overtaking the avalanching face . An eruption column rose 80,000 feet ( 24 km ; 15 mi ) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states and significant ash in two Canadian provinces . At the same time , snow , ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted , forming a series of large lahars ( volcanic mudslides ) that reached as far as the Columbia River , nearly 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the southwest . Less severe outbursts continued into the next day , only to be followed by other large , but not as destructive , eruptions later that year . Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons of TNT . Approximately 57 people were killed directly , including innkeeper Harry R. Truman , photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg , and geologist David A. Johnston .",

Named for George Washington , the first U.S. president , the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory , which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846 , in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute . The state , which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean , Oregon to the south , Idaho to the east , and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north , was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889 . Olympia is the state capital ; the state 's largest city is Seattle . Washington is often referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. Washington is the 18th largest state , with an area of 71,362 square miles ( 184,827 km2 ) , and the 13th most populous state , with more than 7.4 million people . Approximately 60 percent of Washington 's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area , the center of transportation , business , and industry along Puget Sound , an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands , deep fjords , and bays carved out by glaciers . The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west ; mountain ranges in the west , central , northeast , and far southeast ; and a semi-arid basin region in the east , central , and south , given over to intensive agriculture .

El Chich\u00f3n is a complex of domes with a tuff ring , made of ejected volcanic material , located between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Central America Volcanic Arc . El Chich\u00f3n erupted in 1982 ; prior to this , activity had not occurred since ca.1360 , although debates in literature occur around an eruption occurring in ca.1850 . El Chich\u00f3n became famous for its 1982 eruption . In little under a week , the presumed dormant volcano produced three plinian eruptions ( March 29 , April 3 , and April 4 ) . The eruptions generated a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide and particulates into the atmosphere . The total volume of the eruption was much smaller than the famous eruption of Pinatubo in 1991 ; however El Chich\u00f3n 's impacts were equally significant on global climate . El Chich\u00f3n is often overlooked in comparison to other historic eruptions , yet the 1982 eruptions provide important lessons on preparation for volcanic disasters and the influence volcanoes can have on climate .",

After 69 years of dormancy , the volcano 's eruption caught nearby towns unaware , even though the government had received warnings from multiple volcanological organizations to evacuate the area after the detection of volcanic activity two months earlier . As pyroclastic flows erupted from the volcano 's crater , they melted the mountain 's glaciers , sending four enormous lahars ( volcanically induced mudflows , landslides , and debris flows ) down its slopes at 50 kilometers per hour ( 30 miles per hour ) . The lahars picked up speed in gullies and engulfed the town of Armero , killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants . Casualties in other towns , particularly Chinchin\u00e1 , brought the overall death toll to 23,000 . Footage and photographs of Omayra S\u00e1nchez , a young victim of the tragedy , were published around the world . Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster . A banner at a mass funeral in Ibagu\u00e9 read , The volcano did n't kill 22,000 people . The government killed them . The relief efforts were hindered by the composition of the mud , which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck . By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption , many of the victims with serious injuries were dead . The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees , disfigured human bodies , and piles of debris from entire houses .",

Its eruptive history was unknown to most before the pre-eruption volcanic activities of 1991 , just before June . Pinatubo was heavily eroded , inconspicuous and obscured from view . It was covered with dense forests which supported a population of several thousand indigenous Aetas . Pinatubo is most notorious for its VEI-6 eruption on June 15 , 1991 , the second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska . Complicating the eruption was the arrival of Typhoon Yunya , bringing a lethal mix of ash and rain to towns and cities surrounding the volcano . Predictions at the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas , saving many lives . Surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic surges , pyroclastic falls , and subsequently , by the flooding lahars caused by rainwater re-mobilizing earlier volcanic deposits . This caused extensive destruction to infrastructure and changed river systems for years after the eruption . Minor dome-forming eruptions inside the caldera continued from 1992 to 1993 . The effects of the 1991 eruption were felt worldwide . It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes ( 1.1\u00d71010 short tons ) or 10 km3 ( 2.4 cu mi ) of magma , and 20,000,000 tonnes ( 22,000,000 short tons ) of SO2 , bringing vast quantities of minerals and toxic metals to the surface environment ."
