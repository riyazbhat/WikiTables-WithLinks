  "/wiki/Breath": "Breathing ( or ventilation ) is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment , mostly by bringing in oxygen and flushing out carbon dioxide . All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration , which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product . Breathing , or external respiration , brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion . The body 's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells , where cellular respiration takes place . The breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli . The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate , and is one of the four primary vital signs of life . Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically , and unconsciously , controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant . Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances , contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids ( ECF ) . Over-breathing ( hyperventilation ) and under-breathing ( hypoventilation ) , which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively , cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case , and a lowering of the pH in the second . Both cause distressing symptoms . Breathing has other important functions . It provides a mechanism for speech , laughter and similar expressions of the emotions .",
