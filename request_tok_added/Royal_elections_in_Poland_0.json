As the fourth son of King Henry II of France , he was not expected to inherit the French throne and thus was a good candidate for the vacant throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , where he was elected King/Grand Duke in 1573 . During his brief rule , he signed the Henrician Articles into law , recognizing the Polish nobility 's right to freely elect their monarch . Aged 22 , Henry abandoned Poland upon inheriting the French throne when his brother , Charles IX , died without issue . France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion , and Henry 's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers : the Catholic League ( supported by Spain and the Pope ) , the Protestant Huguenots ( supported by England and the Dutch ) and the Malcontents , led by Henry 's own brother , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on , which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king . Henry III was himself a , arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse . After the death of Henry 's younger brother Francis , Duke of Anjou , and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir , the Wars of Religion developed into a succession crisis , the War of the Three Henrys . Henry III 's legitimate heir was his distant cousin , King Henry III of Navarre , a Protestant . The Catholic League , led by Henry I , Duke of Guise , sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic Charles , Cardinal of Bourbon , as Henry III 's heir . In 1589 , Jacques Cl\u00e9ment , a Catholic fanatic , murdered Henry III . He was succeeded by the King of Navarre who , as Henry IV , assumed the throne of France after converting to Catholicism , as the first French king of the House of Bourbon .",

After the death of King Sigismund II Augustus , her brother and the last male member of the Jagiellonian dynasty , Anna 's hand was sought by pretenders to the Polish throne to maintain the dynastic tradition . Anna was elected , along with her then-fianc\u00e9 Stephen B\u00e1thory , as co-ruler in the 1576 royal election of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth .

The Polish throne was contested by Stephen B\u00e1thory and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II . It began on 12 December 1575 when Emperor Maximillian was chosen as monarch by the Polish Senate , while the majority of the szlachta ( nobility ) had voted for Bathory . It ended on 16 December 1577 . Maximilian 's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig 's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig 's privileges . With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily , a compromise was reached , with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized , in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as Grand Duke of western Prussia . Danzig made its oath conditional on the removal of the Statute of the Karnkowski commission of 1569/70 .",

Sigismund was the son of John III of Sweden and his first wife , Catherine Jagiellon of Poland . Elected to the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , he sought to create a personal union between the Commonwealth and Sweden ( Polish-Swedish union ) , and succeeded for a time in 1592 . After he had been deposed in 1599 from the Swedish throne by his Protestant uncle , Charles IX of Sweden , and a meeting of the Riksens st\u00e4nder , he spent much of the rest of his life attempting to reclaim it . A pious yet erratic ruler , Sigismund attempted to hold absolute power in all his dominions . Shortly after his victory over internal opposition , Sigismund took advantage of a period of civil unrest in Muscovy , known as the Time of Troubles , and invaded Russia , holding Moscow for two years ( 1610-12 ) and Smolensk thereafter . In 1617 the Polish-Swedish conflict , which had been interrupted by an armistice in 1611 , broke out again . While Sigismund 's army was also fighting Ottoman forces in Moldavia ( 1617-21 ) , King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden invaded Sigismund 's lands , capturing Riga in 1621 and seizing almost all of Polish Livonia . Sigismund , who concluded the Truce of Altmark with Sweden in 1629 , never regained the Swedish crown . His Swedish wars resulted , moreover , in Poland 's loss of northern Livonian territories and in a diminution of the kingdom 's international prestige . Sigismund remains a highly controversial figure in Poland .",

The war was fought between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III , with Sigismund eventually being crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . Two major battles of this conflict included the Siege of Krak\u00f3w , in which Maximilian III failed to capture the capital of the Commonwealth , and the Battle of Byczyna , in which Maximilian was forced to surrender .

W\u0142adys\u0142aw was elected Tsar of Russia by the Seven Boyars in 1610 when the Polish army captured Moscow , but did not assume the throne due to his father 's position and a popular uprising . Nevertheless , until 1634 he used the title of Grand Duke of Muscovy .

He supported religious tolerance and carried out military reforms , such as the founding of the Commonwealth Navy . He was also a renowned patron of the arts and music . He failed , however , to realize his dreams of regaining the Swedish crown , gaining fame by defeating the Ottoman Empire , strengthening royal power , and reforming the Commonwealth .

In 1638 he embarked at Genoa for Spain to negotiate a league with Philip IV against France , but suffering shipwreck on the coast of Provence , he was seized and by order of Cardinal Richelieu imprisoned at Vincennes , where he remained two years , and was only released on promise of his brother the king of Poland never to wage war against France . He then travelled through various countries of western Europe , entered the order of Jesuits in Rome , was made cardinal by Innocent X , however , after his return to Poland he again became a layman , and , having succeeded his brother in 1648 , married his widow , Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga . His reign commenced amid the confusion and disasters caused by the great revolt of the Cossacks under Chmielnicki , who had advanced into the very heart of Poland . The power of the king had been stripped of almost all its prerogatives by the growing influence of the nobles . Russia and Sweden , which had long been active enemies of Poland , availed themselves of its distracted condition , and renewed their attacks . George II Rakoczy of Transylvania also invaded the Polish territory , while diet after diet was dissolved by abuses of the liberum veto .

Stanis\u0142aw was born into a powerful magnate family of Greater Poland , and he had the opportunity to travel to western Europe in his youth . In 1702 King Charles XII of Sweden marched into the country as part of a continuing series of conflicts between the powers of northern Europe . Charles forced the Polish nobility to depose Polands king , Augustus II the Strong , and then placed Stanis\u0142aw on the throne ( 1704 ) .

  "/wiki/Great_Northern_War": "The Great Northern War ( 1700-1721 ) was a conflict in which a coalition led by the Tsardom of Russia successfully contested the supremacy of the Swedish Empire in Northern , Central and Eastern Europe . The initial leaders of the anti-Swedish alliance were Peter I of Russia , Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway and Augustus II the Strong of Saxony-Poland-Lithuania . Frederick IV and Augustus II were defeated by Sweden , under Charles XII , and forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706 respectively , but rejoined it in 1709 after the defeat of Charles XII at the Battle of Poltava . George I of Great Britain and of Electorate of Hanover joined the coalition in 1714 for Hanover and in 1717 for Britain , and Frederick William I of Brandenburg-Prussia joined it in 1715 . Charles XII led the Swedish army . Swedish allies included Holstein-Gottorp , several Polish magnates under Stanis\u0142aw I Leszczy\u0144ski ( 1704-1710 ) and Cossacks under the Ukrainian Hetman Ivan Mazepa ( 1708-1710 ) . The Ottoman Empire temporarily hosted Charles XII of Sweden and intervened against Peter I . The war began when an alliance of Denmark-Norway , Saxony , Poland and Russia , sensing an opportunity as Sweden was ruled by the young Charles XII , declared war on the Swedish Empire and launched a threefold attack on Swedish Holstein-Gottorp , Swedish Livonia , and Swedish Ingria . Sweden parried the Danish and Russian attacks at Travendal ( August 1700 ) and Narva ( November 1700 ) respectively , and in a counter-offensive pushed Augustus II 's forces through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to Saxony , dethroning Augustus on the way ( September 1706 ) and forcing him to acknowledge defeat in the Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt ( October 1706 ) . The treaty also secured the extradition and execution of Johann Reinhold Patkul , architect of the alliance seven years earlier . Meanwhile , the forces of Peter I had recovered from defeat at Narva and gained ground in Sweden 's Baltic provinces , where they cemented Russian access to the Baltic Sea by founding Saint Petersburg in 1703 . Charles XII moved from Saxony into Russia to confront Peter , but the campaign ended in 1709 with the destruction of the main Swedish army at the decisive Battle of Poltava ( in present-day Ukraine ) and Charles ' exile in the Ottoman town of Bender .",

The war ended with Stanis\u0142aw 's victory and the Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt in 1706 in which August II renounced his claims to the Polish throne . Stanis\u0142aw 's triumph would be short-lived , however , as by 1709 he would be forced to give up the throne to Augustus II once again .",
  "/wiki/War_of_the_Polish_Succession": "The War of the Polish Succession ( ; 1733-35 ) was a major European conflict sparked by a Polish civil war over the succession to Augustus II of Poland , which the other European powers widened in pursuit of their own national interests . France and Spain , the two Bourbon powers , attempted to test the power of the Austrian Habsburgs in western Europe , as did the Kingdom of Prussia , whilst Saxony and Russia mobilized to support the eventual Polish victor . The fighting in Poland resulted in the accession of Augustus III , who in addition to Russia and Saxony , was politically supported by the Habsburgs . The war 's major military campaigns and battles occurred outside of Poland . The Bourbons , supported by Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia , moved against isolated Habsburg territories . In the Rhineland , France successfully took the Duchy of Lorraine , and in Italy , Spain regained control over the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily lost in the War of the Spanish Succession , while territorial gains in northern Italy were limited despite bloody campaigning . Great Britain 's unwillingness to support Habsburg Austria demonstrated the infirmity of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance and may have contributed to Austria 's military failures . Although a preliminary peace was reached in 1735 , the war was formally ended with the Treaty of Vienna ( 1738 ) , in which Augustus III was confirmed as king of Poland and his opponent Stanislaus I was awarded the Duchy of Lorraine by France . Francis Stephen , the duke of Lorraine , was given the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in compensation for the loss of Lorraine . The Duchy of Parma went to Austria whereas Charles of Parma took the crowns of Naples and Sicily , resulting in territorial gains for the Bourbons . Poland also surrendered claims to Livonia and direct control over the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia , which , although remaining a Polish fief , was not integrated into Poland proper and came under strong Russian influence which ended with the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917 .",

He was the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong , and converted to the Roman Catholicism in 1712 to secure his candidacy for the Polish throne . In 1719 he married Maria Josepha , daughter of Joseph I , Holy Roman Emperor , and became Elector of Saxony following his father 's death in 1733 . Augustus was able to gain the support of Charles VI by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and also gained recognition from Russian Empress Anna by supporting Russia 's claim to the region of Courland . He was elected king of Poland by a small minority on 5 October 1733 and subsequently banished the former Polish king Stanis\u0142aw I . He was crowned in Krak\u00f3w on 17 January 1734 . Augustus was supportive of Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession ( 1742 ) and again in the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 ) , both of which resulted in Saxony being defeated and occupied by the Prussian Kingdom . In Poland , his rule was marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families , and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs . His rule deepened the social anarchy in Poland and increased the country 's dependence on its neighbours , notably Prussia , Austria and Russia . The Russian Empire prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne , supporting instead the aristocrat Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski , the lover of Catherine the Great . Throughout his reign , Augustus was known to be more interested in ease and pleasure than in the affairs of state ; this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser , Heinrich von Br\u00fchl , who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful Czartoryski family .",

He remains a controversial figure in Polish history . Recognized as a great patron of the arts and sciences and an initiator and firm supporter of progressive reforms , he is also remembered as the King of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian intervention . He is criticized primarily for his failure to stand against the partitions , and thus to prevent the destruction of the Polish state . Having arrived at the Russian imperial court in Saint Petersburg in 1755 , he became romantically involved with the future empress Catherine the Great . With her connivance , in 1764 he was elected King of Poland . Contrary to expectations , he attempted to reform and strengthen the ailing Commonwealth . His efforts met with external opposition from Prussia , Russia and Austria , all committed to keeping the Commonwealth weak . From within he was opposed by conservative interests , which saw reforms as threatening their traditional liberties and privileges . The defining crisis of his early reign was the War of the Bar Confederation ( 1768-1772 ) that led to the First Partition of Poland ( 1772 ) . The later part of his reign saw reforms wrought by the Great Sejm ( 1788-1792 ) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791 . These reforms were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the Polish-Russian War of 1792 , leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland ( 1793 ) , the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising ( 1794 ) and the final and Third Partition of Poland ( 1795 ) , marking the end of the Commonwealth ."
