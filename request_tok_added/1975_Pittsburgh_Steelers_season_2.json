  "/wiki/1975_San_Diego_Chargers_season": "The San Diego Chargers season was the franchise 's 6th season in the National Football League ( NFL ) , and its 16th overall . The team failed to improve on their 5-9 record in 1974 . The Chargers lost their first eleven games amidst attendances under 30,000 , along with considerable off-field problems as several regular players wanted to leave and the franchise knew it would not get the first choice in the 1976 draft due to the expansion Seahawks and Buccaneers . By the beginning of December , the prospect of the first winless and tieless season since World War II loomed , and led to serious discussion of the Chargers plight in the press - although that press acknowledged that even with three games to go the Chargers had a genuine chance to win facing fellow cellar-dwellers the Jets and Kansas City . The Chargers eventually finished 2-12 , tying the New Orleans Saints for the NFLs worst record . The team suffered badly from injuries , most critically running back Don Woods , who had been AFC Rookie of the Year in 1974 , but played only the first four games in this season . 1975 would remain as the Chargers poorest until a 1-15 disaster in 2000 .",

  "/wiki/1975_Cleveland_Browns_season": "The 1975 Cleveland Browns season was the team 's 26th season with the National Football League . The Browns lost their first nine games - again , a team record - en route to going 3-11 in Forrest Gregg 's first year as head coach after having been promoted from offensive line coach following the offseason firing of Nick Skorich . Making matters even harder to swallow was that , save for a 16-15 decision at Denver in Week 5 and a 24-17 decision at Cincinnati in the season opener , the losses were pretty much one-sided . At home no less , the Browns fell 42-10 to the Minnesota Vikings , 42-6 to the Pittsburgh Steelers and 40-10 to the Houston Oilers , the worst three-game stretch they 've ever had . Later in the year - it was the last of those nine consecutive defeats - the Browns were beaten 38-17 at Oakland . The Steelers and Vikings both finished 12-2 , the Oilers just missed the playoffs at 10-4 and the 11-3 Raiders lost to Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game , but none of that was of any consolation to a franchise as proud as the Browns . [ citation needed ] After 1974 , the Browns were hoping that '75 , in which the team went to orange pants and altered its basic uniform design for the first time since that inaugural season of 1946 , would usher in a new era of success . But it did n't work out that way . The problem for the Browns was that they were in the middle of a major rebuilding phase , trying to replace old-line , grizzled veterans from the team 's glory days of the 1960s with free agents from other teams , or young players . Another problem was at the QB position ; Mike Phipps , the Browns ' No . 3 overall pick in the 1970 NFL Draft , threw just four touchdown passes with 19 INTs on the year . More and more , Browns fans were calling for Brian Sipe , who started in two victories in the final five games in 1974 , to permanently secure the starting quarterback job in what became a major quarterback controversy .",
