On social and economic issues , it advocates liberty , social justice , equality , welfare state , along with progressive and secular society . The party 's constitution adheres to liberal-democratic socialist philosophy . After India 's independence in 1947 , Congress formed the central government of India , and many regional state governments . Congress became India 's dominant political party ; as of 2019 , in the 17 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times , heading the central government for more than 54 years . There have been six Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947-1964 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004-2014 ) .
