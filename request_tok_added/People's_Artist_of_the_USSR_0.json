The Russian Republic was composed of sixteen smaller constituent units of autonomous republics , five autonomous oblasts , ten autonomous okrugs , six krais and forty oblasts . Russians formed the largest ethnic group . The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod and Samara . The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized , accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR . By 1961 , it was the third largest producer of petroleum due to new discoveries in the Volga-Urals region and Siberia , trailing in production to only the United States and Saudi Arabia . In 1974 , there were 475 institutes of higher education in the republic providing education in 47 languages to some 23,941,000 students . A network of territorially organized public-health services provided health care . After 1985 , the perestroika restructuring policies of the Gorbachev administration relatively liberalised the economy , which had become stagnant since the late 1970s under General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev , with the introduction of non-state owned enterprises such as cooperatives . The Russian Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 7 November 1917 ( October Revolution ) as a sovereign state and the world 's first constitutionally socialist state with the ideology of Communism . The first Constitution was adopted in 1918 .",

The ESSR was initially established on the territory of the Republic of Estonia on 21 July 1940 , following the invasion of Soviet troops on 17 June 1940 , and the installation of an illegitimate communist government backed by the Soviet Union , which declared Estonia a Soviet constituency . The Estonian SSR was subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union as a Soviet Republic on 6 August 1940 . The territory was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944 and administered as a part of Reichskommissariat Ostland . Most countries did not recognize the incorporation of Estonia de jure and only recognized its Soviet government de facto or not at all . A number of countries continued to recognize Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in the name of their former government . This policy of non-recognition gave rise to the principle of legal continuity , which held that de jure , Estonia remained an independent state under occupation throughout the period 1940-91 . On 16 November 1988 , the Estonian SSR became the first republic within the Soviet sphere of influence to declare state sovereignty from Moscow . On 30 March 1990 , the Estonian SSR declared that Estonia had been occupied since 1940 and declared a transitional period for the country 's full independence . The Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was renamed as the Republic of Estonia on 8 May 1990 . The independence of the Republic of Estonia was re-established on 20 August during the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt the following year and the Soviet Union itself recognized the independence of Estonia on 6 September 1991 ."
