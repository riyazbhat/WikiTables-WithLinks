As a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac , Howard lost his right arm while leading his men against Confederate forces at the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines in June 1862 , an action which later earned him the Medal of Honor . As a corps commander , he suffered two humiliating defeats at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in May and July 1863 , but recovered from the setbacks as a successful corps and later army commander in the Western Theater . Known as the Christian general because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep religious piety , he was given charge of the Freedmen 's Bureau in mid-1865 , with the mission of integrating the former slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era . Howard took charge of labor policy , setting up a system that required freed people to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau , on terms negotiated by the Bureau with white land owners . Howard 's Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen . He attempted to protect freed blacks from hostile conditions , but lacked adequate power , and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson . Howard 's allies , the Radical Republicans , won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction , with the result that freedmen were given the vote . With the help and advice of the Bureau , freedmen joined Republican coalitions and won at the ballot boxes of most of the southern states . Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen , most notably in founding Howard University in Washington and serving as its president 1867-73 . After 1874 , Howard commanded troops in the West , conducting a famous campaign against the Nez Perce tribe . Utley ( 1987 ) concludes that his leadership against the Apaches in 1872 , against the Nez Perce in 1877 , the Bannocks and Paiutes in 1878 , and against the Sheepeaters in 1879 all add up to a lengthy record , although he did not fight as much as George Custer and Nelson Miles .",
