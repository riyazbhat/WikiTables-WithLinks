  "/wiki/The_Matrix": "The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis . [ a ] It stars Keanu Reeves , Laurence Fishburne , Carrie-Anne Moss , Hugo Weaving , and Joe Pantoliano and is the first installment in the Matrix franchise . It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality , the Matrix , created by intelligent machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source . When computer programmer Thomas Anderson , under the hacker alias Neo , uncovers the truth , he is drawn into a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix . The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction . The Wachowskis ' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film 's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions . The film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as bullet time , where the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed , allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally . While some critics have praised the film for its handling of difficult subjects , others have said the deeper themes are largely overshadowed by its action scenes . The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31 , 1999 , and grossed over $ 460 million worldwide . It was well-received by many critics and won four Academy Awards , as well as other accolades , including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards . The Matrix was praised for its innovative visual effects , cinematography and entertainment value . The film is considered to be one of the greatest science fiction films of all time , and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2012 .",
