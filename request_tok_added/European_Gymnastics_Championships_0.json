  "/wiki/European_Men's_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships": "The European Men 's Artistic Gymnastics Championships are an annual series of artistic gymnastics championships for male gymnasts from European countries organised by the European Union of Gymnastics . Originally held biannually and in odd-numbered years , the championships moved to even-numbered years in 1990 . In 2005 a second set of championships was introduced , titled the individual championships . Although numbered as a separate event , winners in either event are considered European champions , and the championships as a result have in effect become an annual event , but in two formats ; in even-numbered years , a stand-alone men 's event incorporates the European Junior Artistic Gymnastics championships ( an entirely separate women 's competition is held in the same years ) , while in odd-numbered years , the separately numbered 'individual championships ' are held in conjunction with the women 's competition of the same description , but without juniors , as a single event . As a result , there is no individual all-around title awarded in even-numbered years ( except for juniors ) , and similarly no team all-around title awarded in odd-numbered years . These thus remain biannual events . Otherwise the apparatus and titles are identical . In 2015 , UEG agreed that beginning in 2018 , the annual European Championships in the midyear of the Olympic cycle ( i.e . 2 years after , and before , a Summer Olympic Games ) would be held as part of the new multi-sport European Championships event , and would be held in that format every four years . These combined events will continue to be run by UEG and the other sports federations . Although both the Men 's and Women 's championships will be held together , in the same venue , these championships will continue to be treated as separate men 's and women 's events , with junior events included . A further event , the European Games also holds a full set of championships for European artistic gymnasts in the year preceding the Summer Olympic Games , having begun in 2015 .",
