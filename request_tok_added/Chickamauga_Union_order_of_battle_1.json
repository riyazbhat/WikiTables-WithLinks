  "/wiki/Jefferson_C._Davis": "Jefferson Columbus Davis ( March 2 , 1828 - November 30 , 1879 ) was a regular officer of the United States Army during the American Civil War , known for the similarity of his name to that of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and for his killing of a superior officer in 1862 . Davis ' distinguished service in Mexico earned him high prestige at the outbreak of the Civil War , when he led Union troops through Southern Missouri to Pea Ridge , Arkansas , being promoted to Brigadier General after that significant victory . Following the Siege of Corinth , he was granted home leave on account of exhaustion , but returned to duty on hearing of Union defeats in Kentucky , where he reported to General William Bull Nelson at Louisville in September 1862 . Nelson was dissatisfied with his performance , and insulted him in front of witnesses . A few days later , Davis demanded a public apology , but instead the two officers argued noisily and physically , concluding in Davis mortally wounding Nelson with a pistol . Davis avoided conviction , due to the shortage of experienced commanders in the Union Army , but the incident hampered his chances for promotion . He served as a corps commander under William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in 1864 . After the war , Davis was the first commander of the Department of Alaska from 1867 to 1870 , and assumed field command during the Modoc War of 1872-1873 .",
