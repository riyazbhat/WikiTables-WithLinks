The tenor 's vocal range extends up to C5 . The low extreme for tenors is roughly A\u266d2 ( two A\u266ds below middle C ) . At the highest extreme , some tenors can sing up to the second F above middle C ( F5 ) .

  "/wiki/Bass-baritone": "A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying classical baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice . The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles : the Dutchman in Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder , Wotan/Der Wanderer in the Ring Cycle and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg . Wagner labelled these roles as Hoher Bass ( high bass ) - see fach for more details . The bass-baritone voice is distinguished by two attributes . First , it must be capable of singing comfortably in a baritonal tessitura . Secondly , however , it needs to have the ripely resonant lower range typically associated with the bass voice . For example , the role of Wotan in Die Walk\u00fcre covers the range from F ( the F at the bottom of the bass clef ) to F ( the F above middle C ) , but only infrequently descends beyond C ( the C below middle C ) . Bass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories : lyric bass-baritone and dramatic bass-baritone . Bass-baritones should not be confused with their vocal cousin - the so-called Verdi baritone . This type of Italianate baritone voice has a brighter tone colour and sings at a slightly higher tessitura than that possessed by the bass-baritone . In addition to the operas of Giuseppe Verdi , its natural home is to be found in operatic music composed after about 1830 by the likes of Donizetti , Ponchielli , Massenet , Puccini and the verismo composers . The term bass-baritone is roughly synonymous with the Italian vocal classification basso cantante ; for example , in the Verdian repertoire , Philip II in Don Carlos is often taken by a bass-baritone , while Ferrando in Il trovatore is sung by a true bass - though the two roles ' ranges are very similar .",
  "/wiki/Soprano": "A soprano [ so\u02c8pra\u02d0no ] is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types . The soprano 's vocal range ( using scientific pitch notation ) is from approximately middle C ( C4 ) = 261 Hz to high A ( A5 ) = 880 Hz in choral music , or to soprano C ( C6 , two octaves above middle C ) = 1046 Hz or higher in operatic music . In four-part chorale style harmony , the soprano takes the highest part , which often encompasses the melody . The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura , soubrette , lyric , spinto , and dramatic soprano .",
  "/wiki/Louise-Rosalie_Lefebvre": "Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre ( 18 June 1755 - 22 September 1821 ) , also known as Madame Dugazon , was a French operatic mezzo-soprano , actress and dancer . Born in Berlin as the daughter of a dancing master at the court of Frederick II of Prussia , she returned to Paris with her parents in 1765 . She made her stage debut at the age of twelve as a dancer , but it was as an actress with songs that she made her debut at the Com\u00e9die Italienne in 1774 in Gr\u00e9try 's Sylvain . She was at once admitted pensionnaire and in 1775 soci\u00e9taire . She became a star of the Com\u00e9die Italienne ( which became the Op\u00e9ra-Comique ) , where she created over 60 roles . She was married to the actor Jean-Henri Gourgaud , who went by the stage name Dugazon . Together they had a child , Gustave Dugazon . The couple soon divorced , but continued to perform at the Com\u00e9die Italienne for more than twenty years . The two kinds of parts with which she was especially identified - young mothers and women past their first youth - are still called jeunes dugazons and m\u00e8res dugazons in French opera . Examples of the first are Jenny in La dame blanche and Berthe de Simiane in Les mousquetaires de la reine ; of the second , Marguerite in Le Pr\u00e9 aux clercs and the queen in La part du diable . The type of voice for these roles is a light mezzo-soprano or a dark-colored soprano leggero , and they are generally less demanding technically ."
