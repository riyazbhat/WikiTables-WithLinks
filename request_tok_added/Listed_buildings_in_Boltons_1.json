  "/wiki/All_Saints_Church,_Boltongate": "All Saints ' Church is in the village of Boltongate , Cumbria , England . It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Solway , the archdeaconry of West Cumberland and the diocese of Carlisle . A former fortified church , it is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building .",
  "/wiki/Plinth": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",
  "/wiki/Limestone": "Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral , foraminifera , and molluscs . Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite , which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . A closely related rock is dolomite , which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite , CaMg ( CO3 ) 2 . In old USGS publications , dolomite was referred to as magnesian limestone , a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Transept": "A transept ( with two semitransepts ) is a transverse part of any building , which lies across the main body of the edifice . In churches , a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave in a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) building within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions . Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Bellcote": "A bell-cot , bell-cote or bellcote is a small framework and shelter for one or more bells . Bellcotes are most common in church architecture but are also seen on institutions such as schools . The bellcote may be carried on brackets projecting from a wall or built on the roof of chapels or churches that have no towers . The bellcote often holds the Sanctus bell that is rung at the consecration of the Eucharist .",
  "/wiki/Embattled": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Rood": "A rood or rood cross , sometimes known as a triumphal cross , is a cross or crucifix , especially the large Crucifixion set above the entrance to the chancel of a medieval church . Alternatively , it is a large sculpture or painting of the crucifixion of Jesus .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/String_course": "A belt course , also called a string course or sill course , is a continuous row or layer of stones or brick set in a wall . Set in line with window sills , it helps to make the horizontal line of the sills visually more prominent . Set between the floors of a house , it helps to make the separate floors distinguishable from the exterior of the building . The belt course often projects from the side of the building . Georgian architecture is notable for the use of belt courses . Although the belt course has its origins as a structural component of a building , by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose . In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories , however , a shelf angle is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden , interior steel wall . Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water . Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing , a belt course is often used .",
  "/wiki/Quoin_(architecture)": "Quoins ( /k\u0254\u026an/ or /kw\u0254\u026an/ ) are masonry blocks at the corner of a wall . Some are structural , providing strength for a wall made with inferior stone or rubble , while others merely add aesthetic detail to a corner . These imply strength , permanence , and expense , all reinforcing the onlooker 's sense of a structure 's presence . Stone quoins are used on stone or brick buildings . Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings , extending from the facing brickwork in such a way as to give the appearance of generally uniformly cut ashlar blocks of stone larger than the bricks . Where quoins are decorative and non load-bearing a wider variety of materials is used , including timber , stucco , or other cement render .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Sash_window": "A sash window or hung sash window is made of one or more movable panels , or sashes , [ A ] that form a frame to hold panes of glass , which are often separated from other panes ( or lights ) by glazing bars , also known as muntins in the US ( moulded strips of wood ) . Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash , the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically , or horizontally in a style known as a Yorkshire light , sliding sash , or sash and case ( so called because the weights are concealed in a box case ) .",
  "/wiki/Barrel_vault": "A barrel vault , also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault , is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve ( or pair of curves , in the case of a pointed barrel vault ) along a given distance . The curves are typically circular in shape , lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design . The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault : effectively a series of arches placed side by side ( i.e. , one after another ) . It is a form of barrel roof . As with all arch-based constructions , there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault . There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust . One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method . A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other ; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other . This method was most often used in construction of churches , where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building . However , the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing . The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles , thus forming a groin vault . Barrel vaults are known from Ancient Egypt , and were used extensively in Roman architecture .",
  "/wiki/Inglenook": "An inglenook ( Modern Scots ingleneuk ) , or chimney corner , is a recess that adjoins a fireplace . The word comes from ingle , meaning fireplace in Old English ( from Old Scots or Irish aingeal , angel or euphemistically fire ) , and nook .",
  "/wiki/Roughcast": "Roughcast or pebbledash is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand , small gravel , and often pebbles or shells . The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop . The idea is to maintain an even spread , free from lumps , ridges or runs and without missing any background . Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix , whereas pebbledashing adds them on top . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910-1911 ) , roughcast used to be a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings , but it is now frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses , especially those built using timber framing ( half timber ) . Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours , and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded . Though it is an occasional home-design fad , its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5% . However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland , with a high percentage of new houses still being built with roughcasting . [ citation needed ] This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s , when housing was in greater demand , and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could , and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work , which also added rudimentary weather protection . Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building materials needed , although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all , but small and sharp flint chips , and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash . There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar , sharp-dash , sharpstone dash , thrown dash , pebble stucco , Derbyshire Spar , Yellow spar , golden gravel , black and white , and also sunflower . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition , the central tower of St Albans Cathedral , built with Roman tiles from Verulamium , was covered with roughcast believed to be as old as the building .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Pediment": "A pediment is an architectural element found particularly in Classical , Neoclassical and Baroque architecture , and its derivatives , consisting of a gable , usually of a triangular shape , placed above the horizontal structure of the lintel , or entablature , if supported by columns . The tympanum , the triangular area within the pediment , is often decorated with relief sculpture . A pediment is sometimes the top element of a portico . For symmetric designs , it provides a centre point and often used to add grandness to entrances .",
  "/wiki/Fanlight": "A fanlight is a window , often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape , with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan . It is placed over another window or a doorway , and is sometimes hinged to a transom . The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst . It is also called a sunburst light .",
  "/wiki/Rubble_masonry": "Rubble masonry is rough , unhewn building stone set in mortar , but not laid in regular courses . It may appear as the outer surface of a wall or may fill the core of a wall which is faced with unit masonry such as brick or ashlar . Analogously , some medieval cathedral walls are outer shells of ashlar with an inner backfill of mortarless rubble and dirt .",
  "/wiki/Chamfer": "A chamfer /\u02c8\u0283\u00e6m.f\u0259r/ or /\u02c8t\u0283\u00e6m.f\u0259r/ is a transitional edge between two faces of an object . Sometimes defined as a form of bevel , it is often created at a 45\u00b0 angle between two adjoining right-angled faces . Chamfers are frequently used in machining , carpentry , furniture , concrete formwork , mirrors , printed circuit boards , and to facilitate assembly of many mechanical engineering designs .",
  "/wiki/Lintel_(architecture)": "A lintel or lintol is a structural horizontal block that spans the space or opening between two vertical supports . It can be a decorative architectural element , or a combined ornamented structural item . It is often found over portals , doors , windows and fireplaces . In the case of windows , the bottom span is instead referred to as a sill , but , unlike a lintel , does not serve to bear a load to ensure the integrity of the wall . Modern day lintels are made using prestressed concrete and are also referred to as beams in beam and block slabs or ribs in rib and block slabs . These prestressed concrete lintels and blocks are components that are packed together and propped to form a suspended floor concrete slab .",
  "/wiki/Eaves": "The eaves are the edges of the roof which overhang the face of a wall and , normally , project beyond the side of a building . The eaves form an overhang to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style , such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Casement_window": "A casement is a window that is attached to its frame by one or more hinges at the side . They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame , in which case they are hinged on the outside . Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay . Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows , and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers .",
  "/wiki/Carlisle,_Cumbria": "Carlisle ( /k\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8la\u026al/ kar-LYLE , locally /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rla\u026al/ KAR-lyle ; from Cumbric : Caer Luel ; Scottish Gaelic : Cathair Luail ) is a cathedral city and the county town of Cumbria as well as the administrative centre of the City of Carlisle district in North West England . Carlisle is located at the confluence of the rivers Eden , Caldew and Petteril , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the Scottish border . Originally in the historic county of Cumberland , it is now the largest settlement in the county of Cumbria , and serves as the administrative centre for both Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council . At the time of the 2001 census , the population of Carlisle was 71,773 , with 100,734 living in the wider city . Ten years later , at the 2011 census , the city 's population had risen to 75,306 , with 107,524 in the wider city . The early history of Carlisle is marked by its status as a Roman settlement , established to serve the forts on Hadrian 's Wall . During the Middle Ages , because of its proximity to the Kingdom of Scotland , Carlisle became an important military stronghold ; Carlisle Castle , still relatively intact , was built in 1092 by William Rufus , and once served as a prison for Mary , Queen of Scots . The castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum . In the early 12th century , Henry I allowed the foundation of a priory in Carlisle . The town gained the status of a city when its diocese was formed in 1133 , and the priory became Carlisle Cathedral . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle , which developed into a densely populated mill town . This , combined with its strategic position , allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town , with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station .",
  "/wiki/Cockermouth": "Cockermouth /\u02c8k\u0252k\u0259rm\u0259\u03b8/ is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria , England , so named because it is at the confluence of the River Cocker as it flows into the River Derwent . The mid-2010 census estimates state that Cockermouth has a population of 8,204 , increasing to 8,761 at the 2011 Census . Historically a part of Cumberland , Cockermouth is situated outside the English Lake District on its northwest fringe . Much of the architectural core of the town remains unchanged since the basic medieval layout was filled in the 18th and 19th centuries . The regenerated market place is now a central historical focus within the town and reflects events from its 800-year history . The town is prone to flooding and experienced severe floods in 2005 , 2009 , and 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Toll_road": "A toll road , also known as a turnpike or tollway , is a public or private road ( almost always a controlled-access highway in the present day ) for which a fee ( or toll ) is assessed for passage . It is a form of road pricing typically implemented to help recoup the cost of road construction and maintenance . Toll roads have existed in some form since antiquity , with tolls levied on passing travellers on foot , wagon , or horseback ; but their prominence increased with the rise of the automobile , [ citation needed ] and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively . The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type , weight , or number of axles , with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars . Tolls are often collected at toll plazas , toll booths , toll houses , stations , bars , or gates . Some toll collection points are autonomous , and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid . To cut costs and minimise time delay , many tolls are collected with electronic toll collection equipment which automatically communicates with a toll payer 's transponder or uses automatic number plate recognition to charge drivers by debiting their accounts . Criticisms of toll roads include the time taken to stop and pay the toll , and the cost of the toll booth operators - up to about one-third of revenue in some cases . Automated toll-paying systems help minimise both of these . Others object to paying twice for the same road : in fuel taxes and with tolls . In addition to toll roads , toll bridges and toll tunnels are also used by public authorities to generate funds to repay the cost of building the structures . Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure , or are applied as a general fund by local governments , not being earmarked for transport facilities .",
  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",
  "/wiki/Wigton": "Wigton is a market town in Cumbria , England . Historically in Cumberland , it lies just outside the Lake District in the borough of Allerdale . Wigton is at the centre of the Solway Plain , between the Caldbeck Fells and the Solway coast . It is served by Wigton railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line , and the A596 road to Workington . The town of Silloth-on-Solway lies twelve miles to the west , beyond Abbeytown .",
  "/wiki/Coping_(architecture)": "Coping ( from cope , Latin capa ) consists of the capping or covering of a wall . A splayed or wedge coping slopes in a single direction ; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point . A coping may consist of stone ( capstone ) , brick , clay or terracotta , concrete or cast stone , tile , slate , wood , thatch , or various metals , including aluminum , copper , stainless steel , steel , and zinc . In all cases it should be weathered ( have a slanted or curved top surface ) to throw off the water . Various types of copings exist . A diagrammatic explanation of copper copings is available . In Romanesque work copings appeared plain and flat , and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip . In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering ( mainly on the outer side ) , and began at the top with an astragal ; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off ; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section , and the coping mouldings continued round the sides , as well as at top and bottom , mitring at the angles , as in many of the colleges at Oxford .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Modillion": "A modillion is an ornate bracket , a corbel , such as underneath a cornice which it helps to support , more elaborate than dentils ( literally translated as small teeth ) . All three are selectively used as adjectival historic past participles ( modillioned , corbelled , dentillated ) as to what co-supports or simply adorns any high structure of a building , such as a terrace of a roof ( flat area of a roof ) , parapet , pediment/entablature , balcony , cornice band or roof cornice . They occur classically under a Corinthian or a Composite cornice , but may support any type of eaves cornice . They may be carved or plain .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Fluting_(architecture)": "Fluting in architecture consists of shallow grooves running along a surface . The term typically refers to the grooves running vertically on a column shaft or a pilaster , but need not necessarily be restricted to those two applications . If the hollowing out of material meets in a point , the point is called an arris .",
  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",
  "/wiki/Hood_mould": "In architecture , a hood mould , label mould ( from Latin labia , lip ) , drip mould or dripstone , is an external moulded projection from a wall over an opening to throw off rainwater . This moulding can be terminated at the side by ornamentation called a label stop . The hood mould was introduced into architecture in the Romanesque period , though they became much more common in the Gothic period . Later , with the increase in rectangular windows they became more prevalent in domestic architecture .",
  "/wiki/Pier_(architecture)": "A pier , in architecture , is an upright support for a structure or superstructure such as an arch or bridge . Sections of structural walls between openings ( bays ) can function as piers .",
  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",
  "/wiki/Celtic_cross": "The Celtic cross is a form of Christian cross featuring a nimbus or ring that emerged in Ireland and Britain in the Early Middle Ages . A type of ringed cross , it became widespread through its use in the stone high crosses erected across the islands , especially in regions evangelized by Irish missionaries , from the 9th through the 12th centuries . A staple of Insular art , the Celtic cross is essentially a Latin cross with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem . Scholars have debated its exact origins , but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings . The form gained new popularity during the Celtic Revival of the 19th century ; the name Celtic cross is a convention dating from that time . The shape , usually decorated with interlace and other motifs from Insular art , became popular for funerary monuments and other uses , and has remained so , spreading well beyond Ireland ."
