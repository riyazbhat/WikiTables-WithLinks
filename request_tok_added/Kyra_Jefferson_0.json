Monaco has an area of 2.02 km2 ( 0.78 sq mi ) , making it the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican . Its population as of 2018 is 38,682 . With 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 49,230/sq mi ) , it is the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world . Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km ( 3.40 mi ) , the world 's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km ( 2.38 mi ) ( regardless of the coastline paradox ) , and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m ( 5,577 and 1,145 ft ) . The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel , in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward , which is 161 metres ( 528 feet ) above sea level . Monaco 's most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins . Through land reclamation , Monaco 's land mass has expanded by 20 percent . In 2005 , it had an area of only 1.974 km2 ( 0.762 sq mi ) . Monaco is known to be the most expensive and the wealthiest place in the world due to its tax laws .",
  "/wiki/4x100m": "The 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay or sprint relay is an athletics track event run in lanes over one lap of the track with four runners completing 100 metres each . The first runners must begin in the same stagger as for the individual 400 m race . A relay baton is carried by each runner . Prior to 2018 , the baton had to be passed within a 20 m changeover box , preceded by a 10-metre acceleration zone . With a rule change effective November 1 , 2017 that zone was modified to include the acceleration zone as part of the passing zone , making the entire zone 30 metres in length . The outgoing runner can not touch the baton until it has entered the zone , the incoming runner can not touch the baton after it has left the zone . The zone is usually marked in yellow , frequently using lines , triangles or chevrons . While the rule book specifies the exact positioning of the marks , the colors and style are only recommended . While most legacy tracks will still have the older markings , the rule change still uses existing marks . Not all governing body jurisdictions have adopted the rule change . Transfer of the baton in this race is typically blind . The outgoing runner reaches a straight arm backwards when they enter the changeover box , or when the incoming runner makes a verbal signal .",

  "/wiki/Toronto,_Canada": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 . Current to 2016 , the Toronto census metropolitan area ( CMA ) , of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , held a population of 5,928,040 , making it Canada 's most populous CMA . The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants .",
  "/wiki/200m": "The 200 metres ( also spelled 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",
  "/wiki/4x400m": "The 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay or long relay is an athletics track event in which teams consist of four runners who each complete 400 metres or one lap . It is traditionally the final event of a track meet . At top class events , the first 500 metres is run in lanes . Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual 400 metres race ; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track . The slightly longer 4 \u00d7 440 yards relay was a formerly run British and American event , until metrication was completed in the 1970s . Relay race runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates . Runners have a 20 m box ( usually marked with blue lines ) in which to transfer the baton . The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines ; for the second and third transfers , runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track . This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer . Unlike the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay , runners in the 4 \u00d7 400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner , due to the fatigue of the incoming runner , and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race . Consequently , disqualification is rare . As runners have a running start , split times can not be compared to individual 400 m performances .",
