It is part of the Dongfeng Aerospace City ( Base 10 ) . Although the facility is geographically located within Ejin Banner of Inner Mongolia 's Alxa League , it is named after the nearest city , Jiuquan in Gansu Province .",
  "/wiki/Jiuquan_Launch_Area_4": "Launch Area 4 ( LA-4 ) , also known as the South Launch Site or SLS , and LC-43 , is the only active Long March launch complex at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre . It consists of two launch pads ; SLS-1 / 921 and SLS-2 / 603 . SLS-1 has been the launch site for all missions conducted as part of the Shenzhou programme , including the first Chinese manned spaceflight , Shenzhou 5 . Since it was activated in 1999 ; Long March 2C , Long March 2D , Long March 2F , Long March 4C and Long March 11 rockets have launched from LA-4 . The first spacecraft to be launched from the site was Shenzhou 1 , atop a Long March 2F , on 19 November 1999 . SLS-2 became operational in 2003 , and has since been used for most unmanned launches from Jiuquan . As of March 2010 , twenty launches have been made from the complex . The most recent launch from the site was from SLS-2 on 5 March 2010 , when the Long March 4C made its first flight from the complex , carrying the Yaogan 9 satellite . Long March 4 launches had previously only been conducted from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre .",
  "/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit": "A Sun-synchronous orbit ( SSO , also called a heliosynchronous orbit ) is a nearly polar orbit around a planet , in which the satellite passes over any given point of the planet 's surface at the same local mean solar time . More technically , it is an orbit arranged so that it precesses through one complete revolution each year , so it always maintains the same relationship with the Sun .",
  "/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences": "The Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ; Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662 ) , is a Chinese research institute . It has historical origins in the Academia Sinica during the Republican era and formerly also known by that name , is the national academy for the natural sciences of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . Collectively known as the Two Academies ( \u4e24\u9662 ) along with the Chinese Academy of Engineering , it functions as the national scientific think tank and academic governing body , providing advisory and appraisal services on issues stemming from the national economy , social development , and science and technology progress . It is headquartered in Xicheng District , Beijing , with branch institutes all over mainland China . It has also created hundreds of commercial enterprises , Lenovo being one of the most famous . It is the world 's largest research organisation , comprising around 60,000 researchers working in 114 institutes , and has been consistently ranked among the top research organisations around the world . The Chinese Academy of Sciences has been consistently ranked the No . 1 research institute in the world by Nature Index since its inception in 2016 , by Nature Research .",
  "/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit": "A low Earth orbit ( LEO ) is an Earth-centered orbit with an altitude of or less ( approximately one-third of the radius of Earth ) , or with at least 11.25 periods per day ( an orbital period of 128 minutes or less ) and an eccentricity less than 0.25 . Most of the manmade objects in outer space are in LEO . There is a large variety of other sources that define LEO in terms of altitude . The altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit . Even for circular orbits , the altitude above ground can vary by as much as ( especially for polar orbits ) due to the oblateness of Earth 's spheroid figure and local topography . While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous , most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because , according to Kepler 's third law , this corresponds to a semi-major axis of . For circular orbits , this in turn corresponds to an altitude of above the mean radius of Earth , which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions . The LEO region is defined by some sources as the region in space that LEO orbits occupy . Some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the LEO region near their lowest altitude ( or perigee ) but are not in an LEO Orbit because their highest altitude ( or apogee ) exceeds . Sub-orbital objects can also reach the LEO region but are not in an LEO orbit because they re-enter the atmosphere . The distinction between LEO orbits and the LEO region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in LEO but could collide with satellites or debris in LEO orbits . The International Space Station conducts operations in LEO .",
  "/wiki/Taiyuan_Satellite_Launch_Center": "The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center ( TSLC ) also known as Base 25 ( Chinese : \u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u57fa\u5730 ) , is a People 's Republic of China space and defence launch facility ( spaceport ) . It is situated in Kelan County , Xinzhou , Shanxi Province and is the second of four launch sites having been founded in March 1966 and coming into full operation in 1968 . Taiyuan sits at an altitude of 1500 meters and its dry weather makes it an ideal launch site . Confusingly , U.S. intelligence designates TSLC the 'Wuzhai Missile and Space Test Centre , despite the fact that it is outside the borders of Wuzhai County . [ citation needed ] The site is primarily used to launch meteorological satellites , earth resource satellites and scientific satellites on Long March launch vehicles into sun-synchronous orbits . TSLC is also a major launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles and overland Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile ( SLBM ) tests . The site has a sophisticated Technical Center and Mission Command and Control Center . It is served by two feeder railways that connect with the Ningwu-Kelan railway ."
