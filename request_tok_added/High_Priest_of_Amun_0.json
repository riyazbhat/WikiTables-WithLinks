Other famous pharaohs of the dynasty include Hatshepsut ( c. 1479 BC-1458 BC ) , the longest-reigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty , and Akhenaten ( c. 1353-1336 BC ) , the heretic pharaoh , with his Great Royal Wife , Nefertiti .

Her rise to power was noteworthy as it required her to utilize her bloodline , education , and an understanding of religion . Her bloodline was impeccable as she was the daughter , sister , and wife of a king . Her understanding of religion allowed her to establish herself as the Gods Wife of Amun . Officially , she ruled jointly with Thutmose III , who had ascended to the throne the previous year as a child of about two years old . Hatshepsut was the chief wife of Thutmose II , Thutmose IIIs father .

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish .",
