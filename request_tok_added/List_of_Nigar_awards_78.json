  "/wiki/Cinematographer": "A cinematographer or director of photography ( sometimes shortened to DP or DOP ) is the chief over the camera and light crews working on a film , television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image . The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography . The cinematographer selects the camera , film stock , lenses , filters , etc. , to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the director . Relations between the cinematographer and director vary ; in some instances , the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence ; in others , the director allows little to none , even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection . Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other ; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect . Several American cinematographers have become directors , including Reed Morano , ASC who lensed Frozen River and Beyonce 's Lemonade before winning an Emmy for directing The Handmaid 's Tale . Barry Sonnenfeld , originally the Coen brothers ' DP ; Jan de Bont , cinematographer on films such as Die Hard and Basic Instinct , directed Speed and Twister . Nicolas Roeg , cinematographer on films such as The Caretaker ( 1963 ) and The Masque of the Red Death ( 1964 ) , directed Do n't Look Now ( 1973 ) and The Man Who Fell to Earth ( 1976 ) . Ellen Kuras , ASC photographed Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind as well as a number of Spike Lee films such as Summer of Sam and He Got Game before directing episodes of Legion and Ozark .
