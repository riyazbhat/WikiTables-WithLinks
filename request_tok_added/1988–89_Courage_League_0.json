By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world .

The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy .

  "/wiki/Edge_Hall_Road": "The Edge Hall Road Community Stadium is a rugby union community stadium , located in Orrell , Greater Manchester . Originally built as the permanent ground of the local Orrell rugby union team , but the club departed the stadium in 2007 , with the development team of Wigan Warriors beginning to use the ground that same year . While the ground has a technical capacity of 5,500 , the safety certificate only allows 3,000 at present , due partly to damaged terracing . The Wigan Warriors senior team also uses the ground as their training complex . Throughout the latest years , the stadium has had name sponsorship , including The Co-operative , The Wigan Laundry and recently Solid Strip . Currently Wigan warriors are considering selling the ground to a housing developer and relocating their training facilities elsewhere . This would see a further 60 houses being built with only one possible access road .",

  "/wiki/Greater_Manchester": "Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in North West England , with a population of 2.8 million ; the third largest in England after Greater London and the West Midlands . It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",
