Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia , straddling the Bosporus strait ( which separates Europe and Asia ) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea .

With a total population of around 15 million residents in its metropolitan area , Istanbul is one of the world 's most populous cities , ranking as the world 's fifth-largest city proper and the largest European city . The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( coterminous with Istanbul Province ) .

After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE , it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries , during the Roman/Byzantine ( 330-1204 ) , Latin ( 1204-1261 ) , Palaiologos Byzantine ( 1261-1453 ) and Ottoman ( 1453-1922 ) empires . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times , before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 CE and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate . Under the name Constantinople it was the Ottoman capital until 1923 . The capital was then moved to Ankara and the city was renamed Istanbul .

It is the most widely used railway track gauge across the world , with approximately 55% of the lines in the world using it . All high-speed rail lines use standard gauge except those in Russia , Finland , Portugal and Uzbekistan . The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be 1435 mm except in the United States and on some heritage British lines , where it is still defined in U.S. customary units as exactly four feet eight and one half inches ( 0.1 mm larger than the metric standard ) .",
  "/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic": "Left-hand traffic ( LHT ) and right-hand traffic ( RHT ) are the practice , in bidirectional traffic , of keeping to the left side or to the right side of the road , respectively . A fundamental element to traffic flow , it is sometimes referred to as the rule of the road . RHT is used in 165 countries and territories , with the remaining 75 countries and territories using LHT . Countries that use LHT account for about a sixth of the world 's area with about a third of its population and a quarter of its roads . In 1919 , 104 of the world 's territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT . Between 1919 and 1986 , 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT . Many LHT countries were formerly part of the British Empire , although some were not , such as Japan , Thailand , Indonesia , and Suriname . Conversely , many RHT countries were part of the French colonial empire . For rail transport , LHT predominates in Western Europe ( except Germany , Denmark , Austria , Spain , and the Netherlands ) , Latin America ( except Mexico ) , and in countries formerly in the British and French Empires , whereas North American and central and eastern European train services operate RHT . According to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea , water traffic is effectively RHT : a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to starboard ( the right-hand side ) , and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also . For aircraft the US Federal Aviation Regulations suggest RHT principles , both in the air and on water . In LHT vehicles keep left , and cars are RHD ( right-hand drive ) with the steering wheel on the right-hand side and the driver sitting on the offside or side closest to the centre of the road .",
