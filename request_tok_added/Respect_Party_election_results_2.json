  "/wiki/Abjol_Miah": "The Respect Party was a left-wing to far-left political party active in the United Kingdom between 2004 and 2016 . At the height of its success in 2007 , the party had one Member of Parliament ( MP ) in the House of Commons and nineteen councillors in local government . The Respect Party was established in London by Salma Yaqoob and George Monbiot in 2004 . Arising in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , it grew out of the Stop the War Coalition and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom 's role in the Iraq War . Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups , it was unofficially allied to the Muslim Association of Britain ( MAB ) and the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) , a far-left , Marxist group . In 2005 , Respect 's candidate George Galloway was elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , and the party came second in three other constituencies . Respect made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections , at which point its support peaked . In 2007 , a schism emerged in the party between SWP supporters and the Respect Renewal group led by Galloway and Yaqoob ; the former group left the party to form the Left List . Over the coming years , Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the Electoral Commission in 2016 . Avowedly socialist and opposed to capitalism , Respect called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy , increased funding to public services , and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination . It was Eurosceptic and promoted an anti-imperialist worldview . It was also anti-Zionist , opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestinian solidarity movement .",
