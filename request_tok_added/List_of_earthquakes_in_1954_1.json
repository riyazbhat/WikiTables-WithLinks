It is the most populous , and the second largest autonomous community in the country . The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as a historical nationality . The territory is divided into eight provinces : Almer\u00eda , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , Granada , Huelva , Ja\u00e9n , M\u00e1laga and Seville . Its capital is the city of Seville . Andalusia is located in the south of the Iberian peninsula , in southwestern Europe , immediately south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha ; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea ; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean ; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar . Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines . The small British overseas territory of Gibraltar shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian province of C\u00e1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar . The main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the Sierra Morena and the Baetic System , consisting of the Subbaetic and Penibaetic Mountains , separated by the Intrabaetic Basin . In the north , the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha on Spain 's Meseta Central . To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the Baetic System , while Lower Andalusia is in the Baetic Depression of the valley of the Guadalquivir . The name Andalusia is derived from the Arabic word Al-Andalus ( \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633 ) .",

Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Extending north-northeast from where the Carlsberg Ridge meets the Sheba ridge in the south to the Makran Subduction Zone in the north , it represents the port side of the northward motion of the Indian subcontinent during the Late Cretaceous-Palaeogene break-up of Gondwana . Slip along the Owen Fracture Zone is occurring at /yr , the slowest rate on Earth , which means the Arabian Plate moves northward faster than the Indian Plate ( 4 vs. 2 mm/yr ) . In some usages , the name Owen Transform Fault is used to denote the short section between the end of the Aden-Sheba ridge and the Carlsberg Ridge . Additionally , this area has been called the Aden-Owen-Carlsberg Triple Junction , although the Carlsberg Ridge is offset from the point where the Owen Fracture Zone/Fault intersects the Sheba segment of the Aden Ridge . Owen Fracture Zone is named after HMS Owen that identified the 'fracture line ' in April/May 1963 .
