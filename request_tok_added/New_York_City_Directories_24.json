  "/wiki/Google_Books": "Google Books ( previously known as Google Book Search and Google Print and by its codename Project Ocean ) is a service from Google Inc. that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned , converted to text using optical character recognition ( OCR ) , and stored in its digital database . Books are provided either by publishers and authors through the Google Books Partner Program , or by Google 's library partners through the Library Project . Additionally , Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives . The Publisher Program was first known as Google Print when it was introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2004 . The Google Books Library Project , which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory , was announced in December 2004 . The Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge . However , it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations , and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process . , the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million , but the scanning process has slowed down in American academic libraries . Google estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world , and stated that it intended to scan all of them . , Google celebrated 15 years of Google Books and provided the number of scanned books as more than 40 million titles .",

  "/wiki/Stereotyped": "In social psychology , a stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular category of people . It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group . The type of expectation can vary ; it can be , for example , an expectation about the group 's personality , preferences , or ability . Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category . While such generalizations may be useful when making quick decisions , they may be erroneous when applied to particular individuals . Stereotypes lead to social categorisation , which is one of the reasons for prejudice attitudes , and may arise for a number of reasons .",

  "/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book": "The Negro Motorist Green Book ( also The Negro Motorist Green-Book , The Negro Travelers ' Green Book , or simply the Green Book ) was an annual guidebook for African-American roadtrippers . It was originated and published by African American , New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966 , during the era of Jim Crow laws , when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against African Americans especially and other non-whites was widespread . Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership , the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles as soon as they could , but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road , from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest . In response , Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans , eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America , as well as founding a travel agency . Many black Americans took to driving , in part to avoid segregation on public transportation . As the writer George Schuyler put it in 1930 , all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort , discrimination , segregation and insult . Black Americans employed as athletes , entertainers , and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes . African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles , being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels , and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only sundown towns . Green founded and published the Green Book to avoid such problems , compiling resources to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties , embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable . The maker of a 2019 documentary film about the book offered this summary : Everyone I was interviewing talked about the community that the Green Book created : a kind of parallel universe that was created by the book and this kind of secret road map that the Green Book outlined . From a New York-focused first edition published in 1936 , Green expanded the work to cover much of North America , including most of the United States and parts of Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean , and Bermuda . The Green Book became the bible of black travel during Jim Crow , enabling black travelers to find lodgings , businesses , and gas stations that would serve them along the road .",

It was first published as The Negro Motorist Green Book and later as The Negro Travelers ' Green Book . The books were published from 1936 to 1966 . Green reviewed hotels and restaurants that did business with African Americans during the time of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation in the United States . He printed 15,000 copies each year . In the 1930s , Green began his work by compiling data on stores and motels and gas stations in New York City area that welcomed black travelers , and published his first guide in 1936 . Similar guides had been published for Jewish travelers . Green 's guide was so popular that he immediately began to expand its coverage the next year to other US destinations , adding hotels and restaurants as well .
