  "/wiki/I_Turn_to_You_(All-4-One_song)": "I Turn to You is a song written by American songwriter Diane Warren and first recorded by R & B quartet All-4-One from the soundtrack album to the film Space Jam ( 1996 ) . The ballad , produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , received very little recognition until American pop singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera recorded it for her self-titled debut album . Aguilera , who worked with Warren in another song for her debut album , felt connected to the song after relating its lyrics to her relationship with her mother , and was encouraged by Warren to record the track . Aguilera 's version received mixed reviews from music critics , with some praising her vocal delivery , while others went on to criticize the ballad for being too clich\u00e9d . Nevertheless , the song became a huge success in the United States , peaking at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the charts of multiple countries across the world . In 2008 , I Turn To You was covered by Nina Girado , a Filipino pop/R & B singer , for her album Nina Sings the Hits of Diane Warren . It was also used in many singing competition series , such as American Idol and most recently The Voice .",
