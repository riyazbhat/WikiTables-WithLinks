After success in karting as a child , Schumacher won titles in Formula K\u00f6nig and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship . In 1991 his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being signed by Benetton for the rest of that season . He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993 , before becoming the first German World Drivers ' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill , albeit in controversial circumstances . In 1995 he repeated the success , this time with a greater margin . In 1996 Schumacher moved to Ferrari , who had last won the Drivers ' Championship in 1979 , and helped them transform into the most successful team in Formula One history , as he came close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles , before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix , ending another title run . Schumacher won five consecutive drivers ' titles from 2000 to 2004 , including an unprecedented sixth and seventh title . In 2002 Schumacher won the title with a record six races remaining and finished on the podium in every race . In 2004 Schumacher won twelve out of the first thirteen races and went on to win a record 13 times as he won his final title .

In addition to holding a number of 'youngest ' records in Formula One , Vettel holds the record for the most consecutive race wins ( 9 ) , as well as accumulating the third most race victories ( 53 ) and podium finishes ( 120 ) , and the fourth-most pole positions ( 57 ) . Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006 and made his racing debut with the team at the 2007 United States Grand Prix , replacing the injured Robert Kubica . Already part of the Red Bull programme , Vettel joined Toro Rosso later in the season , and was kept as a driver for 2008 . In his first full season in Formula One , the 21-year-old became the youngest pole-sitter and race winner at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix , although the latter record was broken by Max Verstappen in 2016 . Vettel was promoted to Red Bull for the 2009 season , during which he won four races en route to becoming the youngest-ever World Drivers ' Championship runner-up . The following year , Vettel became the youngest driver ever to win the World Drivers ' Championship , also helping Red Bull win their first World Constructors ' Championship . He followed up his first championship with three more titles in succession , becoming the youngest double , triple and quadruple world champion in Formula One . The 2010 and 2012 titles were decided in the final round ; topping a four-way title battle in Abu Dhabi in 2010 , and beating Fernando Alonso by three points in 2012 , while the 2011 and 2013 titles saw Vettel dominating the seasons to secure the titles early . Ending his long-term association with the team , Vettel activated a clause to end his contract with Red Bull at the end of the 2014 season .",
