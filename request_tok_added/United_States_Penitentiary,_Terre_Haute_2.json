  "/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_73": "Pan Am Flight 73 was a Pan American World Airways flight from Bombay , India , to New York , with scheduled stops in Karachi , Pakistan and Frankfurt , West Germany . On September 5 , 1986 , the Boeing 747-121 serving the flight was hijacked while on the ground at Karachi by four armed Palestinian men of the Abu Nidal Organization . The aircraft , with 360 passengers on board , had just arrived from Bombay . A grand jury later concluded that the militants were planning to use the hijacked airliner to pick up Palestinian prisoners in both Cyprus and Israel . Forty-three passengers were injured or killed during the hijacking , including nationals from India , the United States , Pakistan , and Mexico . All the hijackers were arrested and sentenced to death in Pakistan . However , the sentences were later commuted to life in prison . Neerja Bhanot , head attendant on the flight , posthumously received India 's highest peacetime award for bravery , the Ashok Chakra Award for her efforts to save passengers ' lives during the course of the hijacking .",
  "/wiki/Abu_Nidal_Organization": "The Abu Nidal Organization ( ANO ) is the most common name for the Palestinian nationalist militant group Fatah - The Revolutionary Council ( Fatah al-Majles al-Thawry ) . The ANO is named after its founder Abu Nidal . It was created by a split from Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction of the PLO in 1974 . The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States , the United Kingdom , Japan , Israel and the European Union . The ANO was secular and anti-Western , but was not particularly associated with a broad ideology like leftism or Marxism .",
  "/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking": "Aircraft hijacking ( also known as airplane hijacking , skyjacking , plane hijacking , plane jacking , air robbery , air piracy , or aircraft piracy , with the latter term being used within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ) , or simply hijacking , is the unlawful seizure of an aircraft by an individual or a group . Dating from the earliest of hijackings , most cases involve the pilot being forced to fly according to the hijacker 's demands . However , in rare cases , the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves and used them in suicide attacks ; most notably in the September 11 attacks , and in several cases , planes have been hijacked by the official pilot or co-pilot . Unlike carjacking or sea piracy , an aircraft hijacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft . Individuals driven by personal gain often divert planes to destinations where they are not planned to go . Some hijacking situations intend to use passengers or crew as hostages , either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities . Various motives have driven such occurrences , such as demanding the release of certain high-profile individuals or for the right of political asylum ( notably Flight ET 961 ) . Hijackings involving hostages have produced violent confrontations between hijackers and the authorities , during negotiation and settlement . In the case of Lufthansa Flight 181 and Air France Flight 139 , the hijackers were not satisfied and showed no inclination to surrender , resulting in attempts by special forces to rescue passengers . In most jurisdictions of the world , aircraft hijacking is punishable by life imprisonment or a long prison sentence . In most jurisdictions where the death penalty is a legal punishment , aircraft hijacking is a capital crime , including in China , India , and the U.S. states of Georgia and Mississippi .",

  "/wiki/Connecticut": "Connecticut ( /k\u0259\u02c8n\u025bt\u026ak\u0259t/ ( listen ) ) is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States . As of the 2010 Census , it has the highest per-capita income , Human Development Index ( 0.962 ) , and median household income in the United States . It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east , Massachusetts to the north , New York to the west , and Long Island Sound to the south . Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport . It is part of New England , although portions of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state . The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for long tidal river . Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony .",
  "/wiki/Hitman": "Contract killing is a form of murder in which one party hires another party ( often called a hitman ) to kill a target individual or group of people . It involves an illegal agreement between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment , monetary or otherwise . Either party may be a person , group , or an organization . Contract killing has been associated with organized crime , government conspiracies , and vendettas . For example , in the United States , the gang Murder , Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s . Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing , making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect said party with the murder . The likelihood that authorities will establish that party 's guilt for the committed crime , especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party , makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party .",

Peterson first received national publicity in 2007 when his fourth wife , Stacy Ann Cales Peterson , disappeared . Although the police and Stacy Ann 's family suspect foul play , she has never been found . Suspicions in Stacy Ann 's case were fueled in part by the death of Savio , whose bruised body was found in a dry bathtub in her home in 2004 , with a large gash in her scalp . Initially , Savio 's official cause of death was found to be accidental drowning . In 2009 , after the attention from Stacy Ann 's disappearance , Peterson was indicted for Savio 's murder after a second autopsy showed evidence of a struggle . He was convicted of the murder in 2012 , and was sentenced to 38 years in prison on February 21 , 2013 .

She was held captive by Mitchell and his wife , Wanda Barzee , on the outskirts of Salt Lake City , and later , in San Diego County , California . Her captivity lasted approximately nine months before she was discovered in Sandy , Utah , approximately from her home .

  "/wiki/Pedophile": "Pedophilia ( alternatively spelt paedophilia ) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children . Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11 , and boys at age 11 or 12 , criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13 . A person must be at least 16 years old , and at least five years older than the prepubescent child , for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia . Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty . The International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-11 ) defines it as a sustained , focused , and intense pattern of sexual arousal - as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts , fantasies , urges , or behaviours - involving pre-pubertal children . In popular usage , the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse . This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors . Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided , because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles , child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children , and some pedophiles do not molest children . Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century . A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s . Although mostly documented in men , there are also women who exhibit the disorder , and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles . No cure for pedophilia has been developed , but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse .",
  "/wiki/Kidnapping": "In criminal law , kidnapping is the unlawful transportation , asportation and confinement of a person against their will . Thus , it is a composite crime . It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction , both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping . The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping . Kidnapping of a child is also known as child abduction , and these are sometimes separate legal categories .",
  "/wiki/Mann_Act": "The White-Slave Traffic Act , or the Mann Act , is a United States federal law , passed June 25 , 1910 ( ch . 395 , ; codified as amended at ) .

In its original form the act made it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery , or for any other immoral purpose . Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution , immorality , and human trafficking , particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution . It was one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the Progressive Era . In practice , its ambiguous language about immorality resulted in it being used to criminalize even consensual sexual behavior between adults . It was amended by Congress in 1978 and again in 1986 to limit its application to transport for the purpose of prostitution or other illegal sexual acts .",

  "/wiki/2007_Fort_Dix_attack_plot": "The 2007 Fort Dix attack plot involved a group of six Muslim men who were found guilty of conspiring to stage an attack against U.S. Military personnel stationed at Fort Dix , New Jersey . The alleged goal of the group was to kill as many soldiers as possible .

The remaining member was thought to have had a minor role in the plot and was sentenced to five years in prison for weapons offenses . Some accuse the FBI of entrapment , stating that the FBI informants created the conspiracy . The FBI used two convicts as paid informants in the case , one of whom was fighting deportation . In addition , they point to issues such as the ineffective assistance of their lawyers , the lack of impartiality of the judge , and the absence of explicit evidence of participation in the alleged plot .
