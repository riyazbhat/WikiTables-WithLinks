  "/wiki/Toyota_RS": "The is an automobile which has been produced by Toyota in Japan since 1955 . It is currently a line of mid/full-size luxury sedans primarily aimed at the Japanese market and sold in other select Asian markets . Introduced in 1955 , it has served as the mainstream sedan from Toyota in the Japanese market throughout its existence and holds the distinction of being the longest-running passenger-car nameplate affixed to any Toyota model , along with being the first Toyota vehicle to be exported to the United States in 1958 . Its traditional competitors in Japan and Asia have been the Nissan Cedric/Gloria/Fuga and the Honda Legend , along with the defunct Mazda Luce , Isuzu Bellel and Mitsubishi Debonair . Available at Toyota Store dealers in Japan , the Crown has been popular for government usage , whether as a police car or for transporting government officials . It has also been popular with Japanese companies as company cars along with use as a taxicab . While a base Crown was available for many years aimed at the taxicab market , the increasing opulence and price of the Crown line led to the creation of the Toyota Comfort in 1995 as a more affordable alternative . Outside Japan , the larger Lexus LS took over the role of Toyota 's flagship sedan in 1989 in the company 's global lineup . In North America , the first through fourth generations were offered from 1958 through 1973 . It was replaced with the Toyota Corona Mark II . The Crown has also been partially succeeded in export markets by its closely related sibling , the Lexus GS , which since its debut in 1991 as the Toyota Aristo has always shared the Crown 's platform and powertrain options . Later models of the GS and Crown have taken on a very strong aesthetic kinship through shared design cues ."
