  "/wiki/Short_Story": "A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents , with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood . A dictionary definition is an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot . The short story is a crafted form in its own right . Short stories make use of plot , resonance , and other dynamic components as in a novel , but typically to a lesser degree . While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella ( a shorter novel ) , authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques . Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form . They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation . Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years . The short form is , conceivably , more natural to us than longer forms . We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story , and as William Boyd , the award-winning British author and short story writer has said : [ short stories ] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if , for the duration of its telling , something special has been created , some essence of our experience extrapolated , some temporary sense has been made of our common , turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion . In terms of length , word count is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories , however some have 20,000 words and are still classed as short stories . Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as short short stories , or flash fiction .",
  "/wiki/One-act_play": "A one-act play is a play that has only one act , as distinct from plays that occur over several acts . One-act plays may consist of one or more scenes . In recent years , the 10-minute play has emerged as a popular subgenre of the one-act play , especially in writing competitions . The origin of the one-act play may be traced to the very beginning of drama : in ancient Greece , Cyclops , a satyr play by Euripides , is an early example .",
  "/wiki/Essays": "An essay is , generally , a piece of writing that gives the author 's own argument - but the definition is vague , overlapping with those of a paper , an article , a pamphlet , and a short story . Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal . Formal essays are characterized by serious purpose , dignity , logical organization , length , whereas the informal essay is characterized by the personal element ( self-revelation , individual tastes and experiences , confidential manner ) , humor , graceful style , rambling structure , unconventionality or novelty of theme , etc . Essays are commonly used as literary criticism , political manifestos , learned arguments , observations of daily life , recollections , and reflections of the author . Almost all modern essays are written in prose , but works in verse have been dubbed essays ( e.g. , Alexander Pope 's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man ) . While brevity usually defines an essay , voluminous works like John Locke 's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus 's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples . In some countries ( e.g. , the United States and Canada ) , essays have become a major part of formal education . Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills ; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants , and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams . The concept of an essay has been extended to other media beyond writing . A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea . A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions .",
  "/wiki/Biography": "A biography , or simply bio , is a detailed description of a person 's life . It involves more than just the basic facts like education , work , relationships , and death ; it portrays a person 's experience of these life events . Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae ( r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ) , a biography presents a subject 's life story , highlighting various aspects of his or her life , including intimate details of experience , and may include an analysis of the subject 's personality . Biographical works are usually non-fiction , but fiction can also be used to portray a person 's life . One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing . Works in diverse media , from literature to film , form the genre known as biography . An authorized biography is written with the permission , cooperation , and at times , participation of a subject or a subject 's heirs . An autobiography is written by the person himself or herself , sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or ghostwriter .",
  "/wiki/Travel_literature": "The genre of travel literature encompasses outdoor literature , guide books , nature writing , and travel memoirs . One early travel memoirist in Western literature was Pausanias , a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD . In the early modern period , James Boswell 's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides ( 1786 ) helped shape travel memoir as a genre .",
  "/wiki/Criticism": "Criticism is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something . Criticism is an evaluative or corrective exercise that can occur in any area of human life . Criticism can therefore take many different forms ( see below ) . How people go about criticizing , can vary a great deal . In specific areas of human endeavour , the form of criticism can be highly specialized and technical ; it often requires professional knowledge to appreciate the criticism . For subject-specific information , see the Varieties of criticism page . To criticize does not necessarily imply to find fault , but the word is often taken to mean the simple expression of an object against prejudice , no matter positive or negative . Often criticism involves active disagreement , but it may only mean taking sides . Constructive criticism will often involve an exploration of the different sides of an issue . Criticism is often presented as something unpleasant , but there are friendly criticisms , amicably discussed , and some people find great pleasure in criticism ( keeping people sharp , providing the critical edge ) . The Pulitzer Prize for Criticism has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism ' . When criticism involves a dialogue of some kind , direct or indirect , it is an intrinsically social activity .",
  "/wiki/Verse_(poetry)": "In the countable sense , a verse is formally a single metrical line in a poetic composition . However , verse has come to represent any division or grouping of words in a poetic composition , with groupings traditionally having been referred to as stanzas . In the uncountable ( mass noun ) sense verse refers to poetry as contrasted to prose . Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme , the common unit of prose is purely grammatical , such as a sentence or paragraph . In the second sense verse is also used pejoratively in contrast to poetry to suggest work that is too pedestrian or too incompetent to be classed as poetry .",
  "/wiki/Children\u2019s_literature": "Children 's literature or juvenile literature includes stories , books , magazines , and poems that are made for children . Modern children 's literature is classified in two different ways : genre or the intended age of the reader . Children 's literature can be traced to stories and songs , part of a wider oral tradition , that adults shared with children before publishing existed . The development of early children 's literature , before printing was invented , is difficult to trace . Even after printing became widespread , many classic children 's tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience . Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children , often with a moral or religious message . The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are known as the Golden Age of Children 's Literature because many classic children 's books were published then ."
