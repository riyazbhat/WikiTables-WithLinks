Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two SSIs . In the 1960s , the UK Government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London .

At designation , its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley , Wolverton , and Stony Stratford , along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between . These settlements had an extensive historical record since the Norman conquest ; detailed archaeological investigations prior to development revealed evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic age to modern times , including in particular the Milton Keynes Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery . The government established a Development Corporation ( MKDC ) to design and deliver this New City . The Corporation decided on a softer , more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier new towns but with an emphatically modernist architecture . Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic , they established a 'relaxed ' grid of distributor roads about between edges , leaving the spaces between to develop more organically .",
