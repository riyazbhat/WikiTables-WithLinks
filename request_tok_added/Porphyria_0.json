  "/wiki/Enzyme": "Enzymes /\u02c8\u025bnza\u026amz/ are both proteins and biological catalysts ( biocatalysts ) . Catalysts accelerate chemical reactions . The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates , and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products . Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life . :8.1 Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps . The study of enzymes is called enzymology and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up , recognising that during evolution , some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis , which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic ' properties . Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types . Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules , called ribozymes . Enzymes ' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures . Like all catalysts , enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy . Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster . An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase , which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds .",
  "/wiki/Prevalence": "Prevalence in epidemiology is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition ( typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use ) . It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied , and is usually expressed as a fraction , as a percentage , or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people . It is the total number of cases of a disease in a given area during a given time period . Point prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the condition at a specific point in time . Period prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the condition at some time during a given period ( e.g. , 12 month prevalence ) , and includes people who already have the condition at the start of the study period as well as those who acquire it during that period . Lifetime prevalence ( LTP ) is the proportion of a population that at some point in their life ( up to the time of assessment ) have experienced the condition . Prevalence estimates are used by epidemiologists , health care providers , government agencies , toxicologists , and insurers . Prevalence is contrasted with incidence , which is a measure of new cases arising in a population over a given period ( month , year , etc. ) . The difference between prevalence and incidence can be summarized thus : prevalence answers How many people have this disease right now ? or How many people have had this disease during this time period ? and incidence answers How many people per year newly acquire this disease ? Prevalence is a statistical concept referring to the number of cases of a disease that are present in a particular population at a given time , whereas incidence refers to the number of new cases that develop in a given period of time .",
  "/wiki/ALA_synthase": "Aminolevulinic acid synthase ( ALA synthase , ALAS , or delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase ) is an enzyme ( ) that catalyzes the synthesis of \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) the first common precursor in the biosynthesis of all tetrapyrroles such as hemes , cobalamins and chlorophylls . The reaction is as follows : This enzyme is expressed in all non-plant eukaryotes and the \u03b1-class of proteobacteria . Other organisms produce ALA through a three enzyme pathway known as the Shemin pathway . ALA is synthesized through the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA . In humans , transcription of ALA synthase is tightly controlled by the presence of Fe-binding elements , to prevent accumulation of porphyrin intermediates in the absence of iron . There are two forms of ALA synthase in the body . One form is expressed in red blood cell precursor cells ( ALAS2 ) , whereas the other ( ALAS1 ) is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body . The red blood cell form is coded by a gene on chromosome x , whereas the other form is coded by a gene on chromosome 3 . The disease X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutations in the ALA synthase gene on chromosome X , whereas no diseases are known to be caused by mutations in the other gene . Gain of function mutations in the erythroid specific ALA synthase gene have been shown recently to cause a previously unknown form of porphyria known as X-linked-dominant protoporphyria .",
  "/wiki/Sex_linkage": "Sex linkage describes the patterns of inheritance and presentation when a gene mutation ( allele ) is present on a sex chromosome ( allosome ) rather than a non-sex chromosome ( autosome ) . They are characteristically different from the autosomal forms of dominance and recessiveness as they are different depending on the sex of the individual . Since humans have several times as many genes on the female X chromosome than on the male Y chromosome , X-linked traits are much more common than Y-linked traits . Additionally , there are more X-linked recessive conditions than X-linked dominant , and X-linked recessive conditions affect males much more commonly , due to males only having the one X chromosome required for the condition to present . In humans , X-linked traits are inherited from a carrier or affected mother or from an affected father . In X-linked recessive conditions , a son born to an unaffected father and a carrier mother has a 50% chance of inheriting the mother 's X chromosome carrying the mutant allele and presenting with the condition . A daughter on the other hand has a 50% chance of being a carrier , however a fraction of carriers may display a milder ( or even full ) form of the condition due to their body 's normal X-inactivation process preferably inactivating a certain parent 's X chromosome ( the father 's in this case ) , a phenomenon known as skewed X-inactivation . If the condition is dominant , or if the father is also affected , the daughter has a 50% chance of being affected , with an additional 50% chance of being a carrier in the second case . A son born to an affected father and a non-carrier mother will always be unaffected due to not inheriting the father 's X chromosome . A daughter on the other hand will always be a carrier ( some of which may present with symptoms due to aforementioned skewed X-inactivation ) , unless the condition is dominant , in which case she will always be affected . There are a few Y-linked traits ; these are inherited by sons from their father and are always expressed . The incidence of X-linked recessive conditions in females is the square of that in males : for example , if 1 in 20 males in a human population are red-green color blind , then 1 in 400 females in the population are expected to be color-blind ( / ) * ( / ) .",

  "/wiki/5-aminolevulinate_dehydratase": "Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase is an enzyme ( ) that in humans is encoded by the ALAD gene . It catalyzes the following reaction : The ALAD enzyme is composed of 8 identical subunits and catalyzes the condensation of 2 molecules of delta-aminolevulinate to form porphobilinogen ( a precursor of heme , cytochromes and other hemoproteins ) . ALAD catalyzes the second step in the porphyrin and heme biosynthetic pathway ; zinc is essential for enzymatic activity . ALAD enzymatic activity is inhibited by lead , beginning at blood lead levels that were once considered to be safe ( < 10 \u03bcg/dL ) and continuing to correlate negatively across the range from 5 to 95 \u03bcg/dL . Inhibition of ALAD by lead leads to anemia primarily because it both inhibits heme synthesis and shortens the lifespan of circulating red blood cells , but also by stimulating the excessive production of the hormone erythropoietin , leading to inadequate maturation of red cells from their progenitors . A defect in the ALAD structural gene can cause increased sensitivity to lead poisoning and acute hepatic porphyria . Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified .",
  "/wiki/Autosomal_recessive": "Dominance , in genetics , is the phenomenon of one variant ( allele ) of a gene on a chromosome masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome . The first variant is termed dominant and the second recessive . This state of having two different variants of the same gene on each chromosome is originally caused by a mutation in one of the genes , either new ( de novo ) or inherited . The terms autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive are used to describe gene variants on non-sex chromosomes ( autosomes ) and their associated traits , while those on sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) are termed X-linked dominant , X-linked recessive or Y-linked , and these show a very different inheritance and presentation pattern to autosomal traits which depends on the sex of the individual ( see Sex linkage ) . Additionally , there are other forms of dominance such as incomplete dominance , in which a gene variant has a partial effect compared to when it is present on both chromosomes , and co-dominance , in which different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits . Dominance is not inherent to an allele or its traits ( phenotype ) . It is a strictly relative effect between two alleles of a given gene of any function ; one allele can be dominant over a second allele of the same gene , recessive to a third and co-dominant with a fourth . Additionally , one allele may be dominant for one trait but not others . Often , the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not . Hence , many autosomal recessive conditions are the result of lack of a functioning protein , for example an enzyme . On the other hand , many autosomal dominant conditions result in the presence of a diseased form of a critical protein or simply not enough expressivity of the critical protein .

  "/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy": "Peripheral neuropathy , often shortened to neuropathy , is a general term describing disease affecting the peripheral nerves , meaning nerves beyond the brain and spinal cord . Damage to peripheral nerves may impair sensation , movement , gland or organ function depending on which nerves are affected ; in other words , neuropathy affecting motor , sensory , or autonomic nerves result in different symptoms . More than one type of nerve may be affected simultaneously . Peripheral neuropathy may be acute ( with sudden onset , rapid progress ) or chronic ( symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly ) , and may be reversible or permanent . Common causes include systemic diseases ( such as diabetes or leprosy ) , hyperglycemia-induced glycation , vitamin deficiency , medication ( e.g. , chemotherapy , or commonly prescribed antibiotics including metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics ( Ciprofloxacin , Levaquin , Avelox etc . ) ) , traumatic injury , including ischemia , radiation therapy , excessive alcohol consumption , immune system disease , coeliac disease , non-celiac gluten sensitivity , or viral infection . It can also be genetic ( present from birth ) or idiopathic ( no known cause ) . In conventional medical usage , the word neuropathy ( neuro- , nervous system and -pathy , disease of ) without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy . Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called mononeuropathy and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called symmetrical polyneuropathy or simply polyneuropathy . When two or more ( typically just a few , but sometimes many ) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called mononeuritis multiplex , multifocal mononeuropathy , or multiple mononeuropathy . Neuropathy may cause painful cramps , fasciculations ( fine muscle twitching ) , muscle loss , bone degeneration , and changes in the skin , hair , and nails . Additionally , motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or , most commonly , muscle weakness ; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration , reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance , reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain , spontaneous tingling or burning pain , or skin allodynia ( severe pain from normally nonpainful stimuli , such as light touch ) ; and autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms , depending on the affected glands and organs , but common symptoms are poor bladder control , abnormal blood pressure or heart rate , and reduced ability to sweat normally .",

Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload ( such as in hemolytic anemias ) , which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction . It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any disease process that involves abnormal red blood cells being destroyed in the spleen .
