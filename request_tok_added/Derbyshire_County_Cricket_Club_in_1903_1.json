  "/wiki/Billy_Bestwick": "William Bestwick ( 24 February 1875 - 2 May 1938 ) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1898 and 1926 . He was a demon medium-fast bowler who took over 1400 wickets for the county , including 10 in one innings . From his wild temperament and reckless behaviour , he was known as a bad boy of cricket . Bestwick was born at Tag Hill , Heanor , Derbyshire the son of a miner and worked at Coppice Pit from the age of 11 . He debuted for the Derbyshire team in 1898 , as a professional although still working in the mine in winter . He is one of only two bowlers to have hit ten wickets in a single innings for Derbyshire , a feat he achieved in June 1921 , the other being five-time Test cricketer Tommy Mitchell . He was a true tailender batsman , who never averaged above eight with the bat in a single season for Derbyshire , and did not once reach twenty in his last two hundred and eighty first-class innings , a run of batting failures equalled only by Eric Hollies between 1939 and 1954 . This extreme weakness as a batsman ( and also in the field ) was probably why Bestwick never managed to gain a single Test cap . Though Bestwick finished with the second-weakest average of his debut season , he proved himself capable with best bowling figures of an expensive but successful 4-163 . While Derbyshire were bottom of the 1899 Championship table , the team were looking for an upturn in fortunes . A season average of six would not initially indicate this , however , thanks to the best single batting performance of his career , an innings of 39 against Surrey , Derbyshire bested Leicestershire and the winless Hampshire in the season 's championship table . Derbyshire played host to a team of South Africans in 1901 , as the young Test nation played a series of eleven warm-up matches against English county sides prior to a Test series against the English cricket team .",
