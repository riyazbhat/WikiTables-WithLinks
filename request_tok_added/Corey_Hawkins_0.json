Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert/Tybalt the Prince of Cats in Reynard the Fox , a point of mockery in the play . Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt Prince of Cats ( perhaps referring not only to Reynard but to the Italian word cazzo as well ) . Luigi da Porto adapted the story as Giulietta e Romeo and included it in his Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti published in 1530 . Da Porto drew on Pyramus and Thisbe and Giovanni Boccaccio 's Decameron . Da Porto gave it much of its modern form , including the lovers ' names , the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti , and the location in Verona . He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare 's Mercutio , Tybalt , and Paris . Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of Bartolomeo II della Scala ( a century earlier than Salernitano ) . Montague and Capulet were actual 13th-century political factions , but the only connection between them is a mention in Dante 's Purgatorio as an example of civil dissension .",
