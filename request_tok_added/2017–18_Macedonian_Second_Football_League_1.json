It is the country 's political , cultural , economic , and academic centre . The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . Originally a Paeonian city , Scupi became the capital of Dardania in the second century BC . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , Skopje was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called it \u00dcsk\u00fcb , with this name also being in use in English for a time . The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp and later the Vilayet of Kosovo . At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture . [ citation needed ] In 1912 , it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars .",

In antiquity , Tetovo was a Greco-Roman fortress-town in eastern Illyria , called Oaeneon ( \u039f\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd ) , in Latin Oaeneum , located on the pass between mount Scardos ( now \u0160ar ) and river Artatos ( later called Oracha , now Pena ) , a tributary to river Axios ( \u0391\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) in Greek , or Bardar in Slavic . This was a territory where the Illyrian tribe Penestae lived , and it included the fortress-towns Draudacum , Uskana , Divra and Styberra in northern Pelagonia . Various archaeological findings suggest Tetovo was first inhabited thousands of years ago . Near Tetovo/Oaeneon , a Greek sword of the Mycenean era and a bronze statuette of the 6th c. BCE have been found , discerning a Greek presence since the 2nd mill . BCE . Subsequently , Oaeneon was ruled by many ethnic groups ; the Illyrian Genthius of the Labeatae , by King Perseus of Macedonia , by the Romans , by the Byzantines , by the Slavs , by the Bulgarians , and it was invaded by the Avars . In the 15th c. AD , Oaeneum came under Ottoman rule for about five centuries . Then , most of city 's population converted to Islam and many Ottoman-style structures were built , such as the \u0160arena D\u017eamija and the Arabati Baba Te\u1e31e , which still stand as two of Macedonia 's most significant landmarks of its Ottoman period . During this period , the town belonged to the Vilayet of Kosovo , became a firearm and cannon foundry , and was renamed Kalkandelen ( meaning Shield Penetrator ) ; as a result , the town attracted many workers ( Albanians , Bulgarians , Serbs , and Roma ) and grew to a city .",
