  "/wiki/Apple_Macintosh": "The Macintosh ( mainly Mac since 1998 ) is a family of personal computers designed , manufactured , and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984 . The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability . Around this time , Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac , a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model .",

  "/wiki/Internet": "The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing . The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication with computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s , commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life . Most traditional communication media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are reshaped , redefined , or even bypassed by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .",

  "/wiki/RSS_(file_format)": "RSS ( originally RDF Site Summary ; later , two competing approaches emerged , which used the backronyms Rich Site Summary and Really Simple Syndication respectively ) is a type of web feed which allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized , computer-readable format . These feeds can , for example , allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator . The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content , allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user . This passing of content is called web syndication . Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information , such as blog entries , news headlines , or episodes of audio and video series . RSS is also used to distribute podcasts . An RSS document ( called feed , web feed , or channel ) includes full or summarized text , and metadata , like publishing date and author 's name . A standard XML file format ensures compatibility with many different machines/programs . RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favourite websites or to aggregate data from many sites . Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the website for new content . Instead , their browser constantly monitors the site and informs the user of any updates . The browser can also be commanded to automatically download the new data for the user .",

  "/wiki/Spreadsheet": "A spreadsheet is a computer application for organization , analysis and storage of data in tabular form . Spreadsheets were developed as computerized analogs of paper accounting worksheets . The program operates on data entered in cells of a table . Each cell may contain either numeric or text data , or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells . A spreadsheet may also refer to one such electronic document . Spreadsheet users can adjust any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values . This makes the spreadsheet useful for what-if analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation . Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets , and can display data either as text and numerals , or in graphical form . Besides performing basic arithmetic and mathematical functions , modern spreadsheets provide built-in functions for common financial and statistical operations . Such calculations as net present value or standard deviation can be applied to tabular data with a pre-programmed function in a formula . Spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions , functions to convert between text and numbers , and functions that operate on strings of text . Spreadsheets have replaced paper-based systems throughout the business world .",
  "/wiki/Doug_Engelbart": "Douglas Carl Engelbart ( January 30 , 1925 - July 2 , 2013 ) was an American engineer and inventor , and an early computer and Internet pioneer . He is best known for his work on founding the field of human-computer interaction , particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International , which resulted in creation of the computer mouse , and the development of hypertext , networked computers , and precursors to graphical user interfaces . These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . Engelbart 's law , the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential , is named after him . In the early 1950s , he decided that instead of having a steady job - such as his position at Ames Research Center - he would focus on making the world a better place . He reasoned that because the complexity of the world 's problems was increasing , and because any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people , the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence . He believed that the computer , which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation , would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems . He was a committed , vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world 's increasingly urgent and complex problems . Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab , which he termed bootstrapping . His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned , such that workers spent time improving their tools for improving their tools it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress . NLS , the oN-Line System , developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart 's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA ( as DARPA was then known ) , demonstrated numerous technologies , most of which are now in widespread use ; it included the computer mouse , bitmapped screens , hypertext ; all of which were displayed at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s , which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984 , and NLS was renamed Augment ( now the Doug Engelbart Institute ) .",
  "/wiki/Computer_mouse": "A computer mouse ( plural mice or mouses ) is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface . This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display , which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface . The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968 . Originally wired to a computer , many modern mice are cordless , relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system . Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion , but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts . In addition to moving a cursor , computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display . Mice often also feature other elements , such as touch surfaces and wheels , which enable additional control and dimensional input .",

  "/wiki/TCP/IP": "The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks . It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and the Internet Protocol ( IP ) . During its development , versions of it were known as the Department of Defense ( DoD ) model because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA . The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized , addressed , transmitted , routed , and received . This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers , which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved . From lowest to highest , the layers are the link layer , containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment ( link ) ; the internet layer , providing internetworking between independent networks ; the transport layer , handling host-to-host communication ; and the application layer , providing process-to-process data exchange for applications . The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) . The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model , a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems .",
