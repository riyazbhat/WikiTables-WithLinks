  "/wiki/Animated": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize .

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",

  "/wiki/Twin_Peaks": "Twin Peaks is an American mystery horror drama television series created by Mark Frost and David Lynch that premiered on April 8 , 1990 , on ABC . Declining ratings led to its cancellation after its second season in 1991 . It nonetheless gained a devoted cult following and has been referenced in a wide variety of media . In subsequent years , Twin Peaks is often listed among the greatest television series of all time , and is considered a landmark turning point in television drama . The series follows an investigation headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper ( Kyle MacLachlan ) and local Sheriff Harry S. Truman ( Michael Ontkean ) into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer ( Sheryl Lee ) in the fictional rural town of Twin Peaks , Washington . The show 's narrative draws on elements of detective fiction , but its uncanny tone , supernatural elements , and campy , melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also draw on American soap opera and horror tropes . Like much of Lynch 's work , it is distinguished by surrealism , offbeat humor , and distinctive cinematography . The score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch . The success of the show sparked a media franchise , and the series was followed by a 1992 feature film , Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me , that serves as a prequel to the series . Additional tie-in books were also released . Following a hiatus of over 25 years , the show returned in 2017 with a third season on Showtime , marketed as Twin Peaks : The Return and Twin Peaks : A Limited Event Series . The season was directed by Lynch and written by Lynch and Frost , and starred many original cast members , including MacLachlan ."
