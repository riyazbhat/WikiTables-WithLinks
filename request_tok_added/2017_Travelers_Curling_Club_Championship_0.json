Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta .

The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

Other notable cities include Prince Albert , Moose Jaw , Yorkton , Swift Current , North Battleford , Melfort , and the border city Lloydminster ( partially within Alberta ) . Saskatchewan is a landlocked province with large distances to moderating bodies of waters . As a result , its climate is extremely continental , rendering severe winters throughout the province . Southern areas have very warm or hot summers .

  "/wiki/Yukon": "Yukon ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0k\u0252n/ ( listen ) ; French : [ jyk\u0254\u0303 ] ; also commonly called the Yukon ) is the smallest and westernmost of Canada 's three territories . It has the smallest population of any province or territory in Canada , with a population of 35,874 people . Whitehorse , the territorial capital and Yukon 's only city , is the largest settlement in any of the three territories . Yukon was split from the Northwest Territories in 1898 and was originally named the Yukon Territory . The federal government 's Yukon Act , which received royal assent on March 27 , 2002 , established Yukon as the territory 's official name , though Yukon Territory is also still popular in usage and Canada Post continues to use the territory 's internationally approved postal abbreviation of YT . Though officially bilingual ( English and French ) , the Yukon government also recognizes First Nations languages . At 5,959 m ( 19,551 ft ) , Yukon 's Mount Logan , in Kluane National Park and Reserve , is the highest mountain in Canada and the second-highest on the North American continent ( after Denali in the U.S. state of Alaska ) .

Notable rivers include the Yukon River ( after which the territory was named ) , as well as the Pelly , Stewart , Peel , White , and Tatshenshini rivers .",
  "/wiki/Whitehorse,_Yukon": "Whitehorse is the capital and only city of Yukon , and the largest city in northern Canada . It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 ( Historic Mile 918 ) on the Alaska Highway in southern Yukon . Whitehorse 's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River , which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska . The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse , near Miles Canyon , before the river was dammed . Because of the city 's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean , the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife . At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight . Whitehorse , as reported by Guinness World Records , is the city with the least air pollution in the world . As of the 2016 census , the population was 25,085 . This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory ."
