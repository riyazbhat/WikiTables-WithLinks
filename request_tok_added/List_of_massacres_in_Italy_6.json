  "/wiki/Carabinieri": "The Carabinieri ( , , ; formally Arma dei Carabinieri , Carabineers Force ; previously Corpo dei Carabinieri Reali , Royal Carabineers Corps ) are the national gendarmerie of Italy who primarily carry out domestic policing duties . It is one of Italy 's main law enforcement agencies , alongside the Polizia di Stato and the Guardia di Finanza . As with the Guardia di Finanza but in contrast to the Polizia di Stato , the Carabinieri are a military force . As the fourth branch of the Italian Armed Forces , they come under the authority of the Ministry of Defence . In practice , there is a significant overlap between the jurisdiction of the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri , who are contacted on separate emergency telephone numbers . Unlike the Polizia di Stato , the Carabinieri have responsibility for policing the military , and a number of members regularly participate in military missions abroad . They were originally founded as the police force of the Kingdom of Sardinia , the forerunner of the Kingdom of Italy . During the process of Italian unification , the Carabinieri were appointed as the First Force of the new national military organisation . Although the Carabinieri assisted in the suppression of opposition during the rule of Benito Mussolini , they were also responsible for his downfall and many units were disbanded during World War II by Nazi Germany , which resulted in large numbers of Carabinieri joining the Italian resistance movement . In 2001 , they were separated from the Army to become a separate branch of the Italian Armed Forces . Carabinieri have policing powers that can be exercised at any time and in any part of the country , and they are always permitted to carry their assigned weapon as personal equipment ( Beretta 92FS pistols ) . The Carabinieri are often referred to as La Benemerita ( The Reputable or The Meritorious ) as they are a trusted and prestigious law enforcement institution in Italy .",
  "/wiki/Fasci_Siciliani": "The Fasci Siciliani , short for Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori ( Sicilian Workers Leagues ) , were a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration , which arose in Sicily in the years between 1889 and 1894 . The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights . Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment , religiosity , and socialist consciousness , the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893 , when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts . Upon the rejection of these conditions , there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island , and was marked by violent social conflict , almost rising to the point of insurrection . The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control . The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene , and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi declared a state of emergency in January 1894 , dissolving the organizations , arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force . Some reforms followed , including workmen 's compensation and pension schemes . The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration .",

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",
