  "/wiki/World_Class_Championship_Wrestling": "World Class Championship Wrestling ( WCCW ) , also known as the World Class Wrestling Association ( WCWA ) , was an American professional wrestling promotion headquartered in Dallas and Fort Worth , Texas . Originally owned by promoter Ed McLemore , by 1966 it was run by Southwest Sports , Inc. , whose president , Jack Adkisson , was better known as wrestler Fritz Von Erich . Beginning as a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) , it went independent in 1986 in a bid to become a major national promotion , but was unsuccessful in its attempts and eventually went out of business in 1990 . Rights to the pre-1989 WCCW tape library belong to WWE ( the post-1988 rights are owned by International World Class Championship Wrestling ) and select episodes from 1982 to 1988 are available on the WWE Network . World Class Championship Wrestling experienced tremendous success from 1981-1985 , shattering attendance records and achieving global exposure through their syndicated television program . Bookers Ken Mantell , David Von Erich , Gary Hart , Bruiser Brody and Kevin Von Erich provided fans with hard hitting action centered on the popular Von Erich brothers and a cast of devious villains . Storylines during this time followed a consistent theme of friendship and betrayal , with many of the top villains being first presented as friends to the Von Erich Family , only to betray them months or even years later . Talent deals and exchanges helped WCCW bring in future stars such as Chris Adams , The Fabulous Freebirds , Jake Roberts , Mick Foley , a young Shawn Michaels , Gino Hernandez and Iceman King Parsons , and others . World Class Championship Wrestling was a member of the NWA and was originally known as Big Time Wrestling until 1982 , when Adkisson decided that the name of his federation needed to be changed . Mickey Grant , who headed the production of its telecasts , suggested the name World Class . WCCW operated its enterprise in Dallas , Texas and held wrestling events at the Reunion Arena , and mostly at the famed Sportatorium , located just south of Downtown Dallas , which was also a well-known boxing and wrestling arena as well as the one-time home to the famous Big D Jamboree .",
