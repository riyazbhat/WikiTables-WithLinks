  "/wiki/Climate_Change_Performance_Index": "The Climate Change Performance Index ( CCPI ) is an instrument designed by the German environmental and development organisation Germanwatch e.V . to enhance transparency in international climate politics . On the basis of standardised criteria , the index evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 56 countries and the European Union ( EU ) ( Status 2019 ) , which are together responsible for more than 90% of global greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions . The Climate Change Performance Index was first published in 2005 and an updated version is presented at the UN Climate Change Conference annually . Germanwatch publishes the index in cooperation with the NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network International and with financial support from Barthel Foundation . The most important results are available in German , English , French and Spanish .",
  "/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom": "The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual index and ranking created in 1995 by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world 's nations . The creators of the index took an approach similar to Adam Smith 's in The Wealth of Nations , that basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society .",
  "/wiki/Ease_of_Doing_Business_Index": "The ease of doing business index is an index created by Simeon Djankov , an economist at the Central and Eastern Europe sector of the World Bank Group . The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Oliver Hart and Andrei Shleifer . Higher rankings ( a low numerical value ) indicate better , usually simpler , regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights . Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong . An example of such empirical research is a paper on business regulation and poverty , published in Economics Letters . Empirical research is needed to establish the optimal level of business regulation - for example , what the duration of court procedures should be and what the optimal degree of social protection is . The indicators compiled in the Doing Business project allow such research to take place . Since the start of the project in November 2001 , more than 3,000 academic papers have used one or more indicators constructed in Doing Business and the related background papers by its authors .",
  "/wiki/EF_English_Proficiency_Index": "The EF English Proficiency Index ( EF EPI ) attempts to rank countries by the average level of English language skills amongst those adults who took the EF test . It is the product of EF Education First , an international education company , and draws its conclusions from data collected via English tests available for free over the internet . The index is an online survey first published in 2011 based on test data from 1.7 million test takers . The most recent , ninth edition was released in October 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Logistics_Performance_Index": "The Logistics Performance Index ( LPI ) is an interactive benchmarking tool created by the World Bank to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in their performance on trade logistics and what they can do to improve their performance . It is the weighted average of the country scores on six key dimensions : efficiency of the clearance process ( i.e. , speed , simplicity and predictability of formalities ) by border control agencies , including Customs ; quality of trade and transport related infrastructure ( e.g. , ports , railroads , roads , information technology ) ; ease of arranging competitively priced shipments ; competence and quality of logistics services ( e.g. , transport operators , customs brokers ) ; ability to track and trace consignments ; timeliness of shipments in reaching destination within the scheduled or expected delivery time . This measure indicates the relative ease and efficiency with which products can be moved into and inside a country . Germany and Singapore are the most efficient and highest ranked LPI countries . The Logistics Performance Index is reported by the World Bank in every two years . The LPI is based on a worldwide survey of stakeholders on the ground providing feedback on the logistics friendliness of the countries in which they operate and those with which they trade . They combine in-depth knowledge of the countries in which they operate with informed qualitative assessments of other countries where they trade and have experience of global logistics environment .",
  "/wiki/Inequality_adjusted_Human_Development_Index": "This is a list of countries by inequality-adjusted human development index ( IHDI ) , as published by the UNDP in its 2019 Human Development Report . According to the 2016 Report , The IHDI can be interpreted as the level of human development when inequality is accounted for , whereas the Human Development Index itself is an index of potential human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . The HDI , from which the IHDI derives , is a composite statistic of life expectancy , education , and per capita income indicators , which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development . The HDI was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq , and is anchored in the Indian Nobel laureate Amartya Sens work on human capabilities . It is often framed in terms of whether people are able to be and do desirable things in their life , and was published by the United Nations Development Programme . Though insightful , the index does not reckon several factors , such as the net wealth per capita , the relative quality of goods , emissions , crime rate or risk of insolvency in a country . This situation tends to lower the rank for some of the most advanced countries , such as the G7 members and others .",
  "/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index": "The Corruption Perceptions Index ( CPI ) is an index published annually by Transparency International since 1995 which ranks countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption , as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys . The CPI generally defines corruption as the misuse of public power for private benefit . The 2019 CPI , published in January of 2020 , currently ranks 180 countries on a scale from 100 ( very clean ) to 0 ( highly corrupt ) . Denmark , New Zealand and Finland are perceived as the least corrupt nations in the world , ranking consistently high among international financial transparency , while the most perceived corrupt country in the world is Somalia , ranking at 9-10 out of 100 since 2017 . South Sudan is also perceived as one of the most corrupted countries in the world due to constant social and economic crises , ranking an average score of 13 out of 100 in 2018 .",
  "/wiki/Globalization_Index": "The trade-to-GDP ratio is an indicator of the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country . It is calculated by dividing the aggregate value of imports and exports over a period by the gross domestic product for the same period . Although called a ratio , it is usually expressed as a percentage . It is used as a measure of the openness of a country to international trade , and so may also be called the trade openness ratio . It may be seen as an indicator of the degree of globalisation of an economy . Other factors aside , the trade-to-GDP ratio tends to be low in countries with large economies and large populations such as Japan and the United States , and to have a higher value in small economies . Singapore has the highest trade-to-GDP ratio of any country ; between 2008 and 2011 it averaged about 400% . Worldwide trade-to-GDP ratio rose from just over 20% in 1995 to about 30% in 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Human_Development_Index": "The Human Development Index ( HDI ) is a statistic composite index of life expectancy , education , and per capita income indicators , which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development . A country scores a higher HDI when the lifespan is higher , the education level is higher , and the gross national income GNI ( PPP ) per capita is higher . It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian Economist Amartya Sen and was further used to measure a country 's development by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) 's Human Development Report Office . The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index ( IHDI ) . While the simple HDI remains useful , it stated that the IHDI is the actual level of human development ( accounting for inequality ) , and the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential ' human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . The index does not take into account several factors , such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country . This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries , such as the G7 members and others . The index is based on the human development approach , developed by ul Haq , often framed in terms of whether people are able to be and do desirable things in life . Examples include - Being : well fed , sheltered , healthy ; Doing : work , education , voting , participating in community life . The freedom of choice is central - someone choosing to be hungry ( as during a religious fast ) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they can not afford to buy food , or because the country is in a famine .",
  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
