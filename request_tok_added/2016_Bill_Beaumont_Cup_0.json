By the 17th century , Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb , the woven material from which horses ' saddle girths were made . The Bridgewater Canal reached the town in 1765 , stimulating Sale 's urbanisation . The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale 's growth as a commuter town for Manchester , leading to an influx of middle class residents ; by the end of the 19th century the town 's population had more than tripled . Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed . Sale 's urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey , following the Local Government Act 1929 . The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935 , giving Sale honorific borough status . Since then , Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town , supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network .",

Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 .

There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",
