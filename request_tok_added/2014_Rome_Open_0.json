It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",
