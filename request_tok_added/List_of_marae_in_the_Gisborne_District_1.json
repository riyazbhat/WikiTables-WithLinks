The region around the bay is rugged and remote , and for many years the only access to the town was by boat . Because the bay is shallow , a long wharf - the second longest in New Zealand ( 600m ) after the Tiwai Point wharf at Bluff ( 1,500m ) - was built in the 1920s to accommodate visiting vessels . The last cargo ship to use the wharf loaded a cargo of maize in 1967 . In the 1830s there was a thriving flax trade involving early European traders like Barnet Burns . By 1998 , the wharf had deteriorated and was in danger of being closed . In response , the Tolaga Bay Save the Wharf Trust raised funds and gained technical help to restore it . The wharf has now been re-opened and the refurbishment project should finish by May 2013 . The Uawa River reaches the Pacific Ocean in the middle of Tolaga Bay . There is a bar at the river mouth with around 2 metres of water at high tide . The Uawa River is called the Hikuwai further up . Tributaries include the Waiau and the Mangaheia .",

  "/wiki/Te_Rawheoro_Marae": "Tolaga Bay ( ) is both a bay and small town on the East Coast of New Zealand 's North Island located 45 kilometres northeast of Gisborne and 30 kilometres south of Tokomaru Bay . The region around the bay is rugged and remote , and for many years the only access to the town was by boat . Because the bay is shallow , a long wharf - the second longest in New Zealand ( 600m ) after the Tiwai Point wharf at Bluff ( 1,500m ) - was built in the 1920s to accommodate visiting vessels . The last cargo ship to use the wharf loaded a cargo of maize in 1967 . In the 1830s there was a thriving flax trade involving early European traders like Barnet Burns . By 1998 , the wharf had deteriorated and was in danger of being closed . In response , the Tolaga Bay Save the Wharf Trust raised funds and gained technical help to restore it . The wharf has now been re-opened and the refurbishment project should finish by May 2013 . The Uawa River reaches the Pacific Ocean in the middle of Tolaga Bay . There is a bar at the river mouth with around 2 metres of water at high tide . The Uawa River is called the Hikuwai further up . Tributaries include the Waiau and the Mangaheia .",
