  "/wiki/New_Zealand_at_the_Olympics": "New Zealand first competed as an independent nation at 1920 Summer Olympics . Prior to this at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics , New Zealand and Australia athletes competed together in a combined Australasia team . New Zealand has also participated in most Winter Olympic Games since 1952 , missing only the 1956 and 1964 Games .

New Zealand athletes have won a total of 120 medals , with all but three won at the Summer Games . The most successful sports have been rowing and athletics with 24 medals each ; sailing follows closely behind with 22 medals . New Zealand 's three winter medals have come in alpine skiing in 1992 and in snowboarding and freestyle skiing in 2018 . The 120 medals won by New Zealand put New Zealand at number 34 on the all-time Olympic Games medal table for total number of medals and number 26 when weighted by medal type . After the 2016 Summer Olympics , 1371 competitors have represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games . Harry Kerr is considered the first Kiwi Olympian and Adrian Blincoe the 1000th .

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics": "The Soviet Union first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952 , and competed at the Games on 18 occasions subsequently . At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games , the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won , it was second by this count on the other three . Similarly , the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games . Soviet Union 's success might be attributed to a heavy state 's investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage . Following the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War ( 1917-1922 ) , the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds ; however , after World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , attendance at the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting Communist ideals . The Olympic Committee of the USSR was formed on April 21 , 1951 , and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session ( May 7 , 1951 ) . In the same year , when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member , the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement . The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes . On July 20 , 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport , competing in the women 's discus throw . Romashkova 's result in this event ( 51.42 m ) was the new Olympic record at that time . The 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes . There Lyubov Kozyreva won the first Winter Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport , competing in the women 's cross-country skiing 10 km event .",

She competed in the shot put at the 1952 , 1956 , 1960 and 1964 Olympics and finished in first , second , seventh and third place , respectively ; in 1952 she also finished fourth in the javelin throw . Between 1952 and 1956 she set eight consecutive world records and 14 national records in the shot put . In 1953 , she became the first woman to throw over 16 meters ( 16.20 m ) . As a child Zybina was much weakened by hunger and cold during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II , which killed her mother and brother , while her father died at the front lines . Yet by 1950 she had become a top Soviet thrower and won a bronze in the javelin at the European championships . During her entire career as a competitor and coach Zybina accentuated on technique rather than strength . She was left out of the Soviet team before the 1968 Olympics and retired 1969 , because of her age , although she was still a second Soviet shot putter . In retirement she worked as athletics coach in V\u00e4rska , Estonia . Zybina was married to Yury Fyodorov , a Russian captain and commander of the Russian cruiser Aurora in 1964-85 . The cruiser was famous for starting the 1917 October Revolution , but by 1960s was a museum ship . In 1959 she gave birth to a son , which partly explains her poor performance at the 1960 Olympics .",

Bulgaria first participated in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936 , and has attended every Winter Games since then . Bulgarian athletes have won a total of 224 medals , with wrestling and weightlifting as the top medal-producing sports . After the fall of the communist regime in 1989-1990 , in Bulgaria 's turbulent transition to free-market democracy , top-notch state support for Bulgarian Olympians disintegrated . Diminishing and marginalized medal returns were evident in the 2012 London Olympics , where Bulgaria , a former top-10 Olympic power in the late 1980s , fell out of its original high stature . Bulgaria 's best performance to date has come in the 1980 Summer Olympics where they finished third in the overall medal count . In the 1988 Summer Olympics Bulgaria ranked 7th , but won the nation 's largest total of medals to date . The best Winter Olympic result came in 1998 where they ranked 15th .",

  "/wiki/Germany_at_the_Olympics": "Athletes from Germany have taken part in most of the Olympic Games since the first modern Games in 1896 . Germany has hosted three Olympic Games , in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games , and the 1972 Summer Olympics . In addition , Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics , both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars . After these wars , Germans were banned from participating in 1920 , 1924 and 1948 .
