  "/wiki/City_of_license": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",
  "/wiki/Frequency": "Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time . It is also referred to as temporal frequency , which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency . The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event , so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency . For example : if a newborn baby 's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute , its period , T , - the time interval between beats - is half a second ( 60 seconds divided by 120 beats ) . Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena , such as mechanical vibrations , audio signals ( sound ) , radio waves , and light .",
