  "/wiki/Race_caller": "A race caller is a public-address announcer or sportscaster who describes the progress of a race , either for on-track or radio and TV fans . They are most prominent in horse racing , auto racing and track-and-field events . Among the jobs of a race caller is to identify the positions of various entrants during the race , and point out any sudden moves made by them . In horse racing , many callers also point out the posted fractions - the times at which the lead horse reached the quarter-mile , half-mile and similar points of a race . A race-caller who specifically describes the event over a racetrack 's public-address system is the track announcer . In horse racing , track announcers handle up to nine or ten races per day ; more on special stakes-race days . Most horse-race callers memorize the horses ' and jockeys ' ( or drivers in harness racing ) silks and the horses ' colors before the race , to be able to quickly identify each entrant . During a racing day , track announcers also inform patrons of scratches , and jockey/driver and equipment changes ( for example , whether a horse is wearing quarter inch bends or mud caulks ) .",
