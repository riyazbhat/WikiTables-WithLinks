  "/wiki/Goodrich_Castle": "Goodrich Castle is a Norman medieval castle ruin north of the village of Goodrich in Herefordshire , England , controlling a key location between Monmouth and Ross-on-Wye . It was praised by William Wordsworth as the noblest ruin in Herefordshire and is considered by historian Adrian Pettifer to be the most splendid in the county , and one of the best examples of English military architecture . Goodrich Castle was probably built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England , initially as an earth and wooden fortification . In the middle of the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep , and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences . The success of Goodrich 's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years . It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times . Held first by Parliamentary and then Royalist forces in the English Civil War of the 1640s , Goodrich was finally successfully besieged by Colonel John Birch in 1646 with the help of the huge Roaring Meg mortar , resulting in the subsequent slighting of the castle and its descent into ruin . At the end of the 18th century , however , Goodrich became a noted picturesque ruin and the subject of many paintings and poems ; events at the castle provided the inspiration for Wordsworth 's famous 1798 poem We are Seven . By the 20th century the site was a well-known tourist location , now owned by English Heritage and open to the public .",

  "/wiki/Wilton_Castle": "Wilton Castle is a 12th-century Norman castle located in south-eastern Herefordshire , England on the River Wye adjacent to the town of Ross-on-Wye . The castle is named after the manor associated with it . This castle in Herefordshire , still standing mostly to battlement height , remains a monument to its former lords . The Longchamps of Wilton in their time provided Bailiffs of Normandy , Chancellors of England , sheriffs of Hereford and the Welsh Marches and enemies of King John . They were succeeded by the families of De Cantilupe ( see Thomas de Cantilupe and links ) and De Grey who between them built up a powerbase in Wales and the Marches . Matilda de Grey , n\u00e9e de Cantilupe , stood up in court in 1292 and lied through her teeth to King Edward I of England that the castle had been built by her Longchamp ancestors in the days of Edward the Confessor ( 1042-66 ) . In fact , the castle could not have been built before 1154 and certainly the 'barony ' never held the Marcher Lord rights Lady Matilda claimed for it . The castle was primarily associated with a branch of the Norman-descended family of Grey , the Barons Grey of Wilton , a prominent dynasty of Norman Marcher Lords in the Welsh Marches , who held it from 1308 or before . The castle passed from the family when William Grey was captured by the French at the end of the defence of Gu\u00eenes in 1557 , and was forced to sell the castle to raise funds for his ransom . The castle was finally destroyed in the English Civil War , a period that saw skirmishes and sieges locally at Goodrich Castle , Ruardyn Castle and Raglan Castle ."
