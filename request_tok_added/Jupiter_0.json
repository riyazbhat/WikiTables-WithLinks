  "/wiki/Pioneer_10": "Pioneer 10 ( originally designated Pioneer F ) is an American space probe , launched in 1972 and weighing , that completed the first mission to the planet Jupiter . Thereafter , Pioneer 10 became the first of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System . This space exploration project was conducted by the NASA Ames Research Center in California , and the space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc. Pioneer 10 was assembled around a hexagonal bus with a diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna , and the spacecraft was spin stabilized around the axis of the antenna . Its electric power was supplied by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators that provided a combined 155 watts at launch . It was launched on March 2 , 1972 , by an Atlas-Centaur expendable vehicle from Cape Canaveral , Florida . Between July 15 , 1972 , and February 15 , 1973 , it became the first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt . Photography of Jupiter began November 6 , 1973 , at a range of , and about 500 images were transmitted . The closest approach to the planet was on December 4 , 1973 , at a range of . During the mission , the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt , the environment around Jupiter , the solar wind , cosmic rays , and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and heliosphere . Radio communications were lost with Pioneer 10 on January 23 , 2003 , because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter , with the probe at a distance of from Earth .",
  "/wiki/Pioneer_11": "Pioneer 11 ( also known as Pioneer G ) is a robotic space probe launched by NASA on April 6 , 1973 to study the asteroid belt , the environment around Jupiter and Saturn , solar wind and cosmic rays . It was the first probe to encounter Saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by Jupiter . Thereafter , Pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System . Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe , the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30 , 1995 , and the last good engineering data was received on November 24 , 1995 .",
  "/wiki/Voyager_1": "Voyager 1 is a space probe that was launched by NASA on September 5 , 1977 . Part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System , Voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its twin , Voyager 2 . Having operated for 42 years , 5 months and 12 days as of February 18 , 2020 , the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth . Real-time distance and velocity data is provided by NASA and JPL . At a distance of 148.67 AU ( 22.2 billion km ; 13.8 billion mi ) from Earth as of January 19 , 2020 it is the most distant man-made object from Earth . The probe 's objectives included flybys of Jupiter , Saturn , and Saturn 's largest moon , Titan . Although the spacecraft 's course could have been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby , exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere . Voyager 1 studied the weather , magnetic fields , and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons . After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12 , 1980 , Voyager 1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity required to leave the Solar System . [ citation needed ] On August 25 , 2012 , Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium . In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1 , the Voyager team completed a successful test of the spacecraft 's trajectory correction maneuver ( TCM ) thrusters in late 2017 ( the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980 ) , a project enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years . Voyager 1 's extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025 when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments .",
  "/wiki/Voyager_2": "Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA on August 20 , 1977 , to study the outer planets . Part of the Voyager program , it was launched 16 days before its twin , Voyager 1 , on a trajectory that took longer to reach Jupiter and Saturn but enabled further encounters with Uranus and Neptune . It is the only spacecraft to have visited either of these two ice giant planets . Voyager 2 is the fourth of five spacecraft to achieve the Solar escape velocity , which will allow it to leave the Solar System . Its primary mission ended with the exploration of the Neptunian system on October 2 , 1989 , after having visited the Uranian system in 1986 , the Saturnian system in 1981 , and the Jovian system in 1979 . Voyager 2 is now in its extended mission to study the outer reaches of the Solar System and has been operating for 42 years , 5 months and 28 days as of February 17 , 2020 . It remains in contact through the NASA Deep Space Network . At a distance of 122 AU ( 1.83\u00d71010 km ) ( about 16:58 light-hours ) from the Sun as of November 5 , 2018 , moving at a velocity of 15.341 km/s ( 55,230 km/h ) relative to the Sun , Voyager 2 left the heliosphere , and entered the interstellar medium ( ISM ) , a region of outer space beyond the influence of the Solar System , joining Voyager 1 which had reached the interstellar medium in 2012 . Voyager 2 has begun to provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma .",
  "/wiki/Ulysses_probe": "Ulysses ( , ) is a decommissioned robotic space probe whose primary mission was to orbit the Sun and study it at all latitudes . It was launched in 1990 and made three fast latitude scans of the Sun in 1994/1995 , 2000/2001 , and 2007/2008 . In addition , the probe studied several comets . Ulysses was a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) with participation from Canada 's National Research Council . The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30 , 2009 . To study the Sun at all latitudes , the probe needed to change its orbital inclination and leave the plane of the Solar System . To change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft to about 80\u00b0 requires a large change in heliocentric velocity , the energy to achieve which far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle . To reach the desired orbit around the Sun , the mission 's planners chose a gravity assist maneuver around Jupiter , but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells . The probe was powered instead by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) . The spacecraft was originally named Odysseus , because of its lengthy and indirect trajectory to study the solar poles . It was renamed Ulysses , the Latin translation of Odysseus , at ESA 's request in honor not only of Homer 's mythological hero but also of Dante 's character in the Inferno . Ulysses was originally scheduled for launch in May 1986 aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on STS-61-F. Due to the loss of Challenger , the launch of Ulysses was delayed until October 6 , 1990 aboard Discovery ( mission STS-41 ) .",
  "/wiki/Cassini\u2013Huygens": "The Cassini-Huygens space-research mission ( ) , commonly called Cassini , involved a collaboration between NASA , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , and the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) to send a probe to study the planet Saturn and its system , including its rings and natural satellites . The Flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA 's Cassini probe and ESA 's Huygens lander , which landed on Saturn 's largest moon , Titan . Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit . The two craft took their names from the astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens . Launched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15 , 1997 , Cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years , with 13 years spent orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1 , 2004 . The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus ( April 1998 and July 1999 ) , Earth ( August 1999 ) , the asteroid 2685 Masursky , and Jupiter ( December 2000 ) . The mission ended on September 15 , 2017 , when Cassini 's trajectory took it into Saturn 's upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn 's moons , which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft . The mission is widely perceived to have been successful beyond expectations . NASA 's Planetary Science Division Director , Jim Green , described Cassini-Huygens as a mission of firsts , that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system , including its moons and rings , and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System . Cassinis planners originally scheduled a mission of four years , from June 2004 to May 2008 . The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010 , branded the Cassini Equinox Mission . The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission , lasting another seven years until September 15 , 2017 , on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn 's upper atmosphere .",
  "/wiki/New_Horizons": "New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was launched as a part of NASA 's New Frontiers program . Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) and the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI ) , with a team led by S. Alan Stern , the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015 , and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects ( KBOs ) in the decade to follow , which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth . It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System . On January 19 , 2006 , New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s ( 10.10 mi/s ; 58,500 km/h ; 36,400 mph ) . It was the fastest man-made object ever launched from Earth . After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL , New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter , making its closest approach on February 28 , 2007 , at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers ( 1.4 million miles ) . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons ' speed ; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons ' scientific capabilities , returning data about the planet 's atmosphere , moons , and magnetosphere . Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems , except for brief annual checkouts . On December 6 , 2014 , New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter , and instrument check-out began . On January 15 , 2015 , the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto . On July 14 , 2015 , at 11:49 UTC , it flew 12,500 km ( 7,800 mi ) above the surface of Pluto , making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet . In August 2016 , New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h ( 52,000 mph ) ."
