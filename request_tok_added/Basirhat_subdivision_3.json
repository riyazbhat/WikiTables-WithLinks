  "/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes": "The Scheduled Caste ( SCs ) and Scheduled Tribes ( STs ) are officially designated groups of people in India . The terms are recognised in the Constitution of India and the groups are designated in one or other of the categories . For much of the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent , they were known as the Depressed Classes . In modern literature , the Scheduled Castes are sometimes referred to as Dalit , meaning broken/scattered in Sanskrit , having been popularised by B. R. Ambedkar ( 1891-1956 ) , the economist , reformer , father of the Indian Constitution , and Dalit leader during the independence struggle , himself a Dalit . Ambedkar preferred the term Dalit to Gandhi 's term , Harijan , meaning person of Hari/Vishnu ( or Man of God ) . In September 2018 , the government issued an advisory to all private satellite channels asking them to 'refrain ' from using the nomenclature 'Dalit ' , though rights groups and intellectuals have come out against any shift from 'Dalit ' in popular usage . The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes comprise about 16.6% and 8.6% , respectively , of India 's population ( according to the 2011 census ) . The Constitution ( Scheduled Castes ) Order , 1950 lists 1,108 castes across 29 states in its First Schedule , and the Constitution ( Scheduled Tribes ) Order , 1950 lists 744 tribes across 22 states in its First Schedule . Since the independence of India , the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were given Reservation status , guaranteeing political representation . The Constitution lays down the general principles of positive discrimination for SCs and STs .",
  "/wiki/Hindus": "Hindus ( Hindustani : [ \u02c8\u0266\u026andu ] ( listen ) ) are persons who regard themselves as culturally , ethnically , or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism . Historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent . The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",
  "/wiki/Muslims": "Muslims are people who follow or practice Islam , a monotheistic Abrahamic religion . Muslims consider the Quran , their holy book , to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad . The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad ( sunnah ) as recorded in traditional accounts ( hadith ) . Muslim is an Arabic word meaning submitter ( to God ) . The beliefs of Muslims include : that God ( ) is eternal , transcendent and absolutely one ( tawhid ) ; that God is incomparable , self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten ; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Moses , and Jesus ; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time ( tahrif ) and that the Quran is the final unaltered revelation from God ( Final Testament ) .",
