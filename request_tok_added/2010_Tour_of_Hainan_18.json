The team was then managed by Johan Bruyneel , former team manager of U.S. Postal/Discovery Channel team . Under Bruyneel the ethical nature of the team did not improve , although Astana in this period was very successful . With a lineup including Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador , as well as runner-up Andreas Kl\u00f6den the results were there , however the team was on the verge of financial collapse in May 2009 . A battle for control of the team led to the return of Vinokourov for the 2009 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a caused Bruyneel and at least fourteen of its riders to leave at the end of the 2009 season , most for Team RadioShack .
