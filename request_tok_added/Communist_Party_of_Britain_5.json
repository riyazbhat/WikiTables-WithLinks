  "/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales": "The National Assembly for Wales ( ; commonly known as the Welsh Assembly or Senedd ) is the devolved parliament of Wales , with power to make legislation , vary taxes and scrutinise the Welsh Government . The Assembly comprises 60 members , who are known as Assembly Members , or AMs ( ) . Since 2011 , Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system , in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system , and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the D'Hondt method of proportional representation . Typically the largest party in the Assembly forms the Welsh Government . The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998 , which followed a referendum in 1997 . The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006 . Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011 , making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved . Devolved areas include health , education , economic development , transport , the environment , agriculture , local government and some taxes . Legislation has been passed by the assembly which will change the name of the institution from National Assembly for Wales to the Welsh Parliament in English and Senedd Cymru ( ) in Welsh . The name change is expected to come into effect on 6 May 2020 .",

  "/wiki/Scottish_Parliament": "The Scottish Parliament ( Scottish Gaelic : P\u00e0rlamaid na h-Alba ; Scots : Scots Pairlament ) is the unicameral legislature of Scotland . Located in the Holyrood area of the capital city , Edinburgh , it is frequently referred to by the metonym Holyrood . The Parliament is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament ( MSPs ) , elected for four-year terms under the additional member system : 73 MSPs represent individual geographical constituencies elected by the plurality ( first-past-the-post ) system , while a further 56 are returned from eight additional member regions , each electing seven MSPs . The most recent general election to the Parliament was held on 5 May 2016 , with the Scottish National Party winning a plurality . The original Parliament of Scotland was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland , and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . As a consequence , both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England ceased to exist , and the Parliament of Great Britain , which sat at Westminster in London was formed . Following a referendum in 1997 , in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution , the powers of the devolved legislature were specified by the Scotland Act 1998 . The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament - the areas in which it can make laws - by explicitly specifying powers that are reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster . The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws . The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999 . The competence of the Scottish Parliament has been amended numerous times since then , most notably by the Scotland Act 2012 and Scotland Act 2016 , with some of the most significant changes being the expansion of the Parliament 's powers , especially over taxation and welfare .",
  "/wiki/2011_Scottish_Parliament_election": "The 2011 Scottish Parliament election was held on Thursday , 5 May 2011 to elect 129 members to the Scottish Parliament . The election delivered the first majority government since the opening of Holyrood , a remarkable feat as the Additional Member System used to elect MSPs was originally implemented to prevent any party achieving an overall parliamentary majority . The Scottish National Party ( SNP ) won 69 seats , the most the party has ever held at either a Holyrood or Westminster election , allowing leader Alex Salmond to remain First Minister of Scotland . The SNP gained 32 constituencies , twenty two from the Scottish Labour Party , nine from the Scottish Liberal Democrats and one from the Scottish Conservatives . Such was the scale of their gains that , of the 73 constituencies in Scotland , only 20 came to be represented by MSPs of other political parties . The Scottish Labour Party lost seven seats and suffered their worst election defeat in Scotland since 1931 , with huge losses in their traditional Central Belt constituencies and for the first time having to rely on the regional lists to elect members within these areas . They did , however , remain the largest opposition party . Party leader Iain Gray announced his resignation following his party 's disappointing result . The Scottish Liberal Democrats were soundly defeated ; their popular vote share was cut in half and their seat total reduced from 17 to 5 . Tavish Scott announced his resignation as party leader shortly after the election . For Scottish Conservatives , the election proved disappointing as their popular vote dropped slightly and their number of seats fell by 2 , with party leader Annabel Goldie also announcing her resignation . During the campaign , the four main party leaders engaged in a series of televised debates , as they had in every previous general election .",
