  "/wiki/Chromosome_22_(human)": "Chromosome 22 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells . Humans normally have two copies of chromosome 22 in each cell . Chromosome 22 is the second smallest human chromosome , spanning about 49 million DNA base pairs and representing between 1.5 and 2% of the total DNA in cells . In 1999 , researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome . Chromosome 22 was the first human chromosome to be fully sequenced . Human chromosomes are numbered by their apparent size in the karyotype , with Chromosome 1 being the largest and Chromosome 22 having originally been identified as the smallest . However , genome sequencing has revealed that Chromosome 21 is actually smaller than Chromosome 22 .",

  "/wiki/Asymmetric_crying_facies": "Asymmetric crying facies ( ACF ) , also called partial unilateral facial paresis and hypoplasia of depressor angula oris muscle , is a minor congenital anomaly caused by agenesis or hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle , one of the muscles that control the movements of the lower lip . This unilateral facial weakness is first noticed when the infant cries or smiles , affecting only one corner of the mouth and occurs on the left side in nearly 80% of cases . It is only rarely associated with other birth defects . When the hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle is associated with congenital cardiac defects , the term 'Cayler cardiofacial syndrome ' is used . Cayler syndrome is part of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome . It was characterized by Cayler in 1969 .",
  "/wiki/TBX1": "T-box transcription factor TBX1 also known as T-box protein 1 and testis-specific T-box protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TBX1 gene . Genes in the T-box family are transcription factors that play important roles in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development . To carry out these roles , proteins made by this gene family bind to specific areas of DNA called T-box binding element ( TBE ) to control the expression of target genes .",
  "/wiki/RTN4R": "Reticulon 4 receptor ( RTN4R ) also known as Nogo-66 Receptor ( NgR ) or Nogo receptor 1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the RTN4R gene . This gene encodes the receptor for reticulon 4 , oligodendrocytemyelin glycoprotein and myelin-associated glycoprotein . This receptor mediates axonal growth inhibition and may play a role in regulating axonal regeneration and plasticity in the adult central nervous system .",

  "/wiki/COMT": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ; ) is one of several enzymes that degrade catecholamines ( such as dopamine , epinephrine , and norepinephrine ) , catecholestrogens , and various drugs and substances having a catechol structure . In humans , catechol-O-methyltransferase protein is encoded by the COMT gene . Two isoforms of COMT are produced : the soluble short form ( S-COMT ) and the membrane bound long form ( MB-COMT ) . As the regulation of catecholamines is impaired in a number of medical conditions , several pharmaceutical drugs target COMT to alter its activity and therefore the availability of catecholamines . COMT was first discovered by the biochemist Julius Axelrod in 1957 .",

  "/wiki/EP300": "Histone acetyltransferase p300 also known as p300 HAT or E1A-associated protein p300 ( where E1A = adenovirus early region 1A ) also known as EP300 or p300 is an enzyme that , in humans , is encoded by the EP300 gene . It functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling by allowing histone proteins to wrap DNA less tightly . This enzyme plays an essential role in regulating cell growth and division , prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions ( differentiate ) , and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors . The p300 protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth . The EP300 gene is located on the long ( q ) arm of the human chromosome 22 at position 13.2 . This gene encodes the adenovirus E1A-associated cellular p300 transcriptional co-activator protein . EP300 is closely related to another gene , CREB binding protein , which is found on human chromosome 16 .",
