  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor": "The Holy Roman Emperor , officially the Emperor of the Romans ( ) , and also the German-Roman Emperor ( ) , was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire ( considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the legal successor of the Roman Empire ) during the Middle Ages and the early modern period . The title was , almost without interruption , held in conjunction with title of King of Germany ( rex teutonicorum ) throughout the 12th to 18th centuries . In theory , the emperor was primus inter pares ( first among equals ) among other European Catholic monarchs . In practice , an emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances , including marriage alliances , made him . From an autocracy in Carolingian times ( AD 800-924 ) the title by the 13th century evolved into an elective monarchy , with the emperor chosen by the prince-electors . Various royal houses of Europe , at different times , became de facto hereditary holders of the title , notably the Ottonians ( 962-1024 ) and the Salians ( 1027-1125 ) . Following the late medieval crisis of government , the Habsburgs kept possession of the title without interruption from 1440-1740 . The final emperors were from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine , from 1765-1806 . The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II , after a devastating defeat to Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz . The emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right , though he often contradicted or rivaled the pope , most notably during the Investiture controversy . The Holy Roman Empire never had an empress regnant , though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa exerted strong influence . Throughout its history , the position was viewed as a defender of the Roman Catholic faith .",
