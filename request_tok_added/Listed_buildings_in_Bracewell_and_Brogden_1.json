  "/wiki/St_Michael's_Church,_Bracewell": "St Michael 's Church is in Bracewell Lane , Bracewell , Lancashire , England . It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Skipton , the archdeaconry of Craven , and the Diocese of Leeds . Its benefice is united with those of Holy Trinity , Barnoldswick , and St Mary le Ghyll , Barnoldswick . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Aisle": "An aisle ( British English : gangway ) is , in general ( common ) , a space for walking with rows of seats on both sides or with rows of seats on one side and a wall on the other . Aisles can be seen in airplanes , certain types of buildings , such as churches , cathedrals , synagogues , meeting halls , parliaments and legislatures , courtrooms , theatres , and in certain types of passenger vehicles . Their floors may be flat or , as in theatres , stepped upwards from a stage . Aisles can also be seen in shops , warehouses , and factories , where rather than seats , they have shelving to either side . In warehouses and factories , aisles may consist of storage pallets , and in factories , aisles may separate work areas . In health clubs , exercise equipment is normally arranged in aisles . Aisles are distinguished [ how ? ] from corridors , hallways , walkways , footpaths/pavements ( American English sidewalks ) , trails , paths and ( enclosed ) open areas .",
  "/wiki/Corbel": "In architecture , a corbel is a structural piece of stone , wood or metal jutting from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight , a type of bracket . A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall , whereas a console is a piece applied to the structure . A piece of timber projecting in the same way was called a tassel or a bragger in England .",
  "/wiki/Embattled": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",
  "/wiki/Baptismal_font": "A baptismal font is an article of church furniture used for baptism .",
  "/wiki/Jacobean_architecture": "The Jacobean style is the second phase of Renaissance architecture in England , following the Elizabethan style . It is named after King James I of England , with whose reign ( 1603-1625 in England ) it is associated . At the start of James ' reign there was little stylistic break in architecture , as Elizabethan trends continued their development . However his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture , with Italian influence , was in progress , led by Inigo Jones ; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture , or English Baroque ( though the latter term may be regarded as starting later ) . Courtiers continued to build large prodigy houses , even though James spent less time on summer progresses round his realm than Elizabeth had . The influence of Flemish and German Northern Mannerism increased , now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists , rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign . There continued to be very little building of new churches , though a considerable amount of modifications to old ones , but a great deal of secular building .",
  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques .",
  "/wiki/Ogee": "An ogee ( ) is a curve shaped somewhat like the letter S , consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite senses , so that the ends are parallel , or roughly so . It is a kind of sigmoid curve . The shape has many uses in architecture , where two such curves make up an ogee arch , and where single ogees are very common in mouldings . It is also used in mathematics and fluid mechanics , as well as in marine construction and in plastic surgery . Ogee is also written O.G . This long-standing variant may have originated from a mis-hearing of the spoken word ogee as an abbreviation . Nevertheless , the quasi-abbreviation is often seen in print within the millwork trade .",
  "/wiki/Jamb": "A jamb ( from French jambe , leg ) , in architecture , is the side-post or lining of a doorway or other aperture . The jambs of a window outside the frame are called reveals . Small shafts to doors and windows with caps and bases are known as jamb-shafts ; when in the inside arris of the jamb of a window they are sometimes called scoinsons . A doorjamb , door jamb ( also sometimes doorpost ) is the vertical portion of the door frame onto which a door is secured . The jamb bears the weight of the door through its hinges , and most types of door latches and deadbolts extend into a recess in the doorjamb when engaged , making the accuracy of the plumb ( i.e . true vertical ) and strength of the doorjambs vitally important to the overall operational durability and security of the door . The word jamb is also used to describe a wing of a building , perhaps just in Scottish architecture . John Adam added a 'jamb ' to the old Leith Customs house in the Citadel of Leith in 1754-1755 .",
  "/wiki/Chamfer": "A chamfer /\u02c8\u0283\u00e6m.f\u0259r/ or /\u02c8t\u0283\u00e6m.f\u0259r/ is a transitional edge between two faces of an object . Sometimes defined as a form of bevel , it is often created at a 45\u00b0 angle between two adjoining right-angled faces . Chamfers are frequently used in machining , carpentry , furniture , concrete formwork , mirrors , printed circuit boards , and to facilitate assembly of many mechanical engineering designs .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",
  "/wiki/Molding_(decorative)": "Moulding ( also spelled molding in the United States though usually not within the industry ) , also known as coving ( United Kingdom , Australia ) , is a strip of material with various profiles used to cover transitions between surfaces or for decoration . It is traditionally made from solid milled wood or plaster , but may be of plastic or reformed wood . In classical architecture and sculpture , the molding is often carved in marble or other stones . A plain molding has right-angled upper and lower edges . A sprung molding has upper and lower edges that bevel towards its rear , allowing mounting between two non-parallel planes ( such as a wall and a ceiling ) , with an open space behind . Moldings may be decorated with paterae as long , uninterrupted elements may be boring for eyes .",
  "/wiki/Hood_mould": "In architecture , a hood mould , label mould ( from Latin labia , lip ) , drip mould or dripstone , is an external moulded projection from a wall over an opening to throw off rainwater . This moulding can be terminated at the side by ornamentation called a label stop . The hood mould was introduced into architecture in the Romanesque period , though they became much more common in the Gothic period . Later , with the increase in rectangular windows they became more prevalent in domestic architecture .",
  "/wiki/Sash_window": "A sash window or hung sash window is made of one or more movable panels , or sashes , [ A ] that form a frame to hold panes of glass , which are often separated from other panes ( or lights ) by glazing bars , also known as muntins in the US ( moulded strips of wood ) . Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash , the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically , or horizontally in a style known as a Yorkshire light , sliding sash , or sash and case ( so called because the weights are concealed in a box case ) .",
  "/wiki/Catslide_roof": "A salt cellar ( also called a salt , salt-box and a salt pig ) is an article of tableware for holding and dispensing salt . In British English , the term is normally used for what in North American English are called salt shakers . Salt cellars can be either lidded or open , and are found in a wide range of sizes , from large shared vessels to small individual dishes . Styles range from simple to ornate or whimsical , using materials including glass and ceramic , metals , ivory and wood , and plastic . Use of salt cellars is documented as early as classical Rome . They continued to be used through the first half of the 20th century ; however , usage began to decline with the introduction of free-flowing salt in 1911 , and at last they have been almost entirely replaced by salt shakers . Salt cellars were early collectible as pieces of silver , pewter , glass , etc . Soon after their role at table was replaced by the shaker , salt cellars became a popular collectible in their own right .",
  "/wiki/Casement_window": "A casement is a window that is attached to its frame by one or more hinges at the side . They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame , in which case they are hinged on the outside . Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay . Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows , and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Pediment": "A pediment is an architectural element found particularly in Classical , Neoclassical and Baroque architecture , and its derivatives , consisting of a gable , usually of a triangular shape , placed above the horizontal structure of the lintel , or entablature , if supported by columns . The tympanum , the triangular area within the pediment , is often decorated with relief sculpture . A pediment is sometimes the top element of a portico . For symmetric designs , it provides a centre point and often used to add grandness to entrances .",
  "/wiki/Transom_(architecture)": "In architecture , a transom is a transverse horizontal structural beam or bar , or a crosspiece separating a door from a window above it . This contrasts with a mullion , a vertical structural member . Transom or transom window is also the customary U.S. word used for a transom light , the window over this crosspiece . In Britain , the transom light is usually referred to as a fanlight , often with a semi-circular shape , especially when the window is segmented like the slats of a folding hand fan . A well-known example of this is at the main entrance of 10 Downing Street , London .",
  "/wiki/Architrave": "In classical architecture , an architrave ( /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rk\u026atre\u026av/ ; from Italian : architrave chief beam , also called an epistyle ; from Greek \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd epistylon door frame ) is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of columns . The term can also apply to all sides , including the vertical members , of a frame with mouldings around a door or window . The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings ( or other elements ) framing the top of a door , window or other rectangular opening , where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join ( forming a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint ) .",
  "/wiki/Pier_(architecture)": "A pier , in architecture , is an upright support for a structure or superstructure such as an arch or bridge . Sections of structural walls between openings ( bays ) can function as piers .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Fanlight": "A fanlight is a window , often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape , with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan . It is placed over another window or a doorway , and is sometimes hinged to a transom . The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst . It is also called a sunburst light .",
  "/wiki/Tudor_arch": "A four-centred arch is a low , wide type of arch with a pointed apex . Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius , and then turning into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point . It is a pointed sub-type of the general flattened depressed arch . Two of the most notable types are known as the Persian arch , which is moderately depressed , and the Tudor arch , which is much flatter . This type of arch uses space efficiently and decoratively when used for doorways . It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface . It is a mainstay of Islamic architecture , especially Persian and Mughal architecture ; in the latter the lowest arches often have scalloped edges . In Asia it typically has a less depressed form than in Tudor-style examples . In English architecture , it is often known as a Tudor arch , as it was a common architectural element during the reigns of the Tudor dynasty ( 1485-1603 ) , though its use predates 1485 by several decades , and from about 1550 it was out of fashion for grand buildings . It is a blunted version of the pointed arch of Gothic architecture , of which Tudor architecture is the last phase in England .",
  "/wiki/Cant_(architecture)": "Cant or canted in architecture is an angled ( oblique ) line or surface particularly which cuts off a corner . Canted facades are a typical of , but not exclusive to , Baroque architecture . The angle breaking the facade is less than a right angle , thus enabling a canted facade to be viewed as , and remain , one composition . Bay windows frequently have canted sides .",
  "/wiki/Bay_window": "A bay window is a window space projecting outward from the main walls of a building and forming a bay in a room .",
