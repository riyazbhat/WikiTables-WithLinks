  "/wiki/Joseph_Haydn": "Franz Joseph Haydn [ a ] ( /\u02c8ha\u026ad\u0259n/ ; German : [ \u02c8f\u0281ants \u02c8jo\u02d0z\u025bf \u02c8ha\u026adn\u0329 ] ( listen ) ; 31 March [ b ] 1732 - 31 May 1809 ) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period . He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio . His contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets Father of the Symphony and Father of the String Quartet . Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Esterh\u00e1zy family at their remote estate . Until the later part of his life , this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was , as he put it , forced to become original . [ c ] Yet his music circulated widely , and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe . He was a friend and mentor of Mozart , a tutor of Beethoven , and the older brother of composer Michael Haydn .",
  "/wiki/Franz_Schubert": "Franz Peter Schubert ( German : [ \u02c8f\u0281ant\u0361s \u02c8pe\u02d0t\u0250 \u02c8\u0283u\u02d0b\u0250t ] ; 31 January 1797 - 19 November 1828 ) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras . Despite his short lifetime , Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre , including more than 600 secular vocal works ( mainly lieder ) , seven complete symphonies , sacred music , operas , incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music . His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major , D. 667 ( Trout Quintet ) , the Symphony No . 8 in B minor , D. 759 ( Unfinished Symphony ) , the Great Symphony No . 9 in C major , D. 944 , the three last piano sonatas ( D. 958-960 ) , the opera Fierrabras ( D. 796 ) , the incidental music to the play Rosamunde ( D. 797 ) , and the song cycles Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin ( D. 795 ) and Winterreise ( D. 911 ) . Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna , Schubert 's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age . His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons , but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities . In 1808 , at the age of eleven , he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school , where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn , Mozart , and Beethoven . He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813 , and returned home to live with his father , where he began studying to become a schoolteacher ; despite this , he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically . In 1821 , Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member , which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry . He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828 , the only time he did so in his career . He died eight months later at the age of 31 , the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever , but believed by some historians to be syphilis .",
  "/wiki/Impromptus_(Schubert)": "Franz Schubert 's Impromptus are a series of eight pieces for solo piano composed in 1827 . They were published in two sets of four impromptus each : the first two pieces in the first set were published in the composer 's lifetime as Op . 90 ; the second set was published posthumously as Op . 142 in 1839 ( with a dedication added by the publisher to Franz Liszt ) . The third and fourth pieces in the first set were published in 1857 ( although the third piece was printed by the publisher in G major , instead of G\u266d as Schubert had written it , and remained available only in this key for many years ) . The two sets are now catalogued as D. 899 and D. 935 respectively . They are considered to be among the most important examples of this popular early 19th-century genre . Three other unnamed piano compositions ( D. 946 ) , written in May 1828 , a few months before the composer 's death , are known as both Impromptus and Klavierst\u00fccke ( piano pieces ) . The Impromptus are often considered companion pieces to the Six moments musicaux , and they are often recorded and published together . It has been said that Schubert was deeply influenced in writing these pieces by the Impromptus , Op . 7 ( 1822 ) of Jan V\u00e1clav Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek and by the music of Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek 's teacher V\u00e1clav Tom\u00e1\u0161ek .",
  "/wiki/Robert_Schumann": "Robert Schumann ( German : [ \u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man ] ; 8 June 1810 - 29 July 1856 ) was a German composer , pianist , and influential music critic . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era . Schumann left the study of law , intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist . His teacher , Friedrich Wieck , a German pianist , had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe , but a hand injury ended this dream . Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing . In 1840 , after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck , who opposed the marriage , Schumann married Wieck 's daughter Clara . A lifelong partnership in music began , as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy . Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer Johannes Brahms . Until 1840 , Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano . Later , he composed piano and orchestral works , and many Lieder ( songs for voice and piano ) . He composed four symphonies , one opera , and other orchestral , choral , and chamber works . His best-known works include Carnaval , Symphonic Studies , Kinderszenen , Kreisleriana , and the Fantasie in C. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs , as well as references to works of literature .",
  "/wiki/Philips_Classics_Records": "Philips Classics was started in the 1980s as the new classics record label for Philips Records . It was successful with artists including Alfred Brendel , Sir John Eliot Gardiner , Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields , Mitsuko Uchida , Julian Lloyd Webber , Sir Colin Davis and Andr\u00e9 Rieu .

It was re-released as the Complete Compact Mozart Edition . Parent Universal Music Group , which was formed in 1999 from the merger of the PolyGram and MCA families of labels , merged the label into Decca Records , because the new parent did not have the rights to the Philips name , while PolyGram was a subsidiary of the Philips company .

He was a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time . Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus . During this period , his hearing began to deteriorate , but he continued to conduct , premiering his third and fifth symphonies in 1804 and 1808 , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._29_(Beethoven)": "Ludwig van Beethoven 's Piano Sonata No . 29 in B major , Op . 106 ( known as the Gro\u00dfe Sonate f\u00fcr das Hammerklavier , or more simply as the Hammerklavier ) is a piano sonata that is widely viewed as one of the most important works of the composer 's third period and among the greatest piano sonatas of all time . Completed in 1818 , it is often considered to be Beethoven 's most technically challenging piano composition and one of the most demanding solo works in the classical piano repertoire . The first documented public performance was in 1836 by Franz Liszt in the Salle Erard in Paris .",
  "/wiki/Bagatelles,_Opus_126_(Beethoven)": "Ludwig van Beethoven 's Bagatelles , Op . 126 for solo piano were published late in his career , in the year 1825 . Beethoven dedicated them to his brother Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven ( 1776-1848 ) , and wrote to his publisher , Schott Music , that the Opus 126 Bagatelles are probably the best I 've written . A bagatelle , in Beethoven 's usage , is a kind of brief character piece . The set comprises six short works , as follows : In prefatory remarks to his edition of the works , Otto von Irmer notes that Beethoven intended the six bagatelles be played in order as a single work , at least insofar as this can be inferred from a marginal annotation Beethoven made in the manuscript : Ciclus von Kleinigkeiten ( cycle of little pieces ) . Lewis Lockwood suggests another reason to regard the work as a unity rather than a collection : starting with the second Bagatelle , the keys of the pieces fall in a regular succession of descending major thirds , a pattern Lockwood also notices in Beethoven 's Eroica Symphony and the String Quartet , Op . 127 . Maurice J. E. Brown , writing in the Grove Dictionary , says of the Bagatelles that they are thoroughly typical of their composer and show affinities with the greater instrumental works written at the same time . Some possible such affinities are as follows : # 1 shares the terse , elliptical expression of the first movement of the Piano Sonata Opus 101 ; # 3 shares the style of elaborate , high-register elaboration of a slow melody in triple time , seen in the slow movement of the Hammerklavier Sonata ; and the final Bagatelle opens with a chaotic passage reminiscent of the opening of the finale of the Ninth Symphony .",
  "/wiki/Diabelli_Variations": "The 33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli , Op . 120 , commonly known as the Diabelli Variations , is a set of variations for the piano written between 1819 and 1823 by Ludwig van Beethoven on a waltz composed by Anton Diabelli . It is often considered to be one of the greatest sets of variations for keyboard along with J. S. Bach 's Goldberg Variations . The music writer Donald Tovey called it the greatest set of variations ever written and pianist Alfred Brendel has described it as the greatest of all piano works . It also comprises , in the words of Hans von B\u00fclow , a microcosm of Beethoven 's art . In Beethoven : The Last Decade 1817-1827 , Martin Cooper writes , The variety of treatment is almost without parallel , so that the work represents a book of advanced studies in Beethoven 's manner of expression and his use of the keyboard , as well as a monumental work in its own right . In his Structural Functions of Harmony , Arnold Schoenberg writes that the Diabelli Variations in respect of its harmony , deserves to be called the most adventurous work by Beethoven . Beethoven 's approach to the theme is to take some of its smallest elements - the opening turn , the descending fourth and fifth , the repeated notes - and build upon them pieces of great imagination , power and subtlety . Alfred Brendel wrote , The theme has ceased to reign over its unruly offspring . Rather , the variations decide what the theme may have to offer them . Instead of being confirmed , adorned and glorified , it is improved , parodied , ridiculed , disclaimed , transfigured , mourned , stamped out and finally uplifted . Beethoven does not seek variety by using key-changes , staying with Diabelli 's C major for most of the set : among the first twenty-eight variations , he uses the tonic minor only once .",
  "/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._32_(Beethoven)": "The Piano Sonata No . 32 in C minor , Op . 111 , is the last of Ludwig van Beethoven 's piano sonatas . Along with Beethoven 's 33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli , Op . 120 ( 1823 ) and his two collections of bagatelles - Op . 119 ( 1822 ) and Op . 126 ( 1823 ) - this was one of Beethoven 's last compositions for piano . The work was written between 1821 and 1822 . Like other late period sonatas , it contains fugal elements . It was dedicated to his friend , pupil , and patron , Archduke Rudolf .",

This sonata marks the beginning of what is generally regarded as Beethoven 's final period , where the forms are more complex , ideas more wide-ranging , textures more polyphonic , and the treatment of the themes and motifs even more sophisticated than before .

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising . At 21 , he settled in Paris . Thereafter - in the last 18 years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries ( including Robert Schumann ) . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837 , he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin ( known by her pen name , George Sand ) . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition . In his final years , he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . For most of his life , Chopin was in poor health .",

  "/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn": "Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy [ n 1 ] ( 3 February 1809 - 4 November 1847 ) , born and widely known as Felix Mendelssohn , [ n 2 ] was a German composer , pianist , organist and conductor of the early Romantic period . Mendelssohn 's compositions include symphonies , concertos , piano music and chamber music . His best-known works include his overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the Italian Symphony , the Scottish Symphony , the oratorio Elijah , the overture The Hebrides , his mature Violin Concerto , and his String Octet . The melody for the Christmas carol Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing is also his . Mendelssohn 's Songs Without Words are his most famous solo piano compositions . A grandson of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn , Felix Mendelssohn was born into a prominent Jewish family . He was brought up without religion until the age of seven , when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian . Felix was recognised early as a musical prodigy , but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent . Mendelssohn enjoyed early success in Germany , and revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach , notably with his performance of the St Matthew Passion in 1829 . He became well received in his travels throughout Europe as a composer , conductor and soloist ; his ten visits to Britain - during which many of his major works were premiered - form an important part of his adult career . His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt , Richard Wagner , Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz .",

His international career and reputation led him to work closely with many of the leading musicians , artists and literary figures of his time , and he was a sought-after keyboard instructor and a teacher of composition . From an early age , Busoni was an outstanding if sometimes controversial pianist . He studied at the Vienna Conservatory and then with Wilhelm Mayer and Carl Reinecke . After brief periods teaching in Helsinki , Boston , and Moscow , he devoted himself to composing , teaching , and touring as a virtuoso pianist in Europe and the United States . His writings on music were influential , and covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics . He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland . He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style , but after 1907 , when he published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , he developed a more individual style , often with elements of atonality . His visits to America led to interest in North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected in some of his works . His compositions include works for piano , among them a monumental Piano Concerto , and transcriptions of the works of others , notably Johann Sebastian Bach ( published as the Bach-Busoni Editions ) . He also wrote chamber music , vocal and orchestral works , and operas - one of which , Doktor Faust , he left unfinished when he died , in Berlin , at the age of 58 .",
