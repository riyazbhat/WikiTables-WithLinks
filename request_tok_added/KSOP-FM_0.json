  "/wiki/Call_signs_in_North_America": "Call signs are frequently still used by North American broadcast stations , in addition to amateur radio and other international radio stations that continue to identify by call signs around the world . Each country has a different set of patterns for its own call signs . Call signs are allocated to ham radio stations in Barbados , Canada , Mexico and across the United States . Many countries have specific conventions for classifying call signs by transmitter characteristics and location . The call sign format for radio and television call signs follows a number of conventions . All call signs begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union . For example , the United States has been assigned the following prefixes : AAA-ALZ , K , N , W. For a complete list , see international call sign allocations .",
  "/wiki/Center_frequency": "In electrical engineering and telecommunications , the center frequency of a filter or channel is a measure of a central frequency between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies . It is usually defined as either the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean of the lower cutoff frequency and the upper cutoff frequency of a band-pass system or a band-stop system . Typically , the geometric mean is used in systems based on certain transformations of lowpass filter designs , where the frequency response is constructed to be symmetric on a logarithmic frequency scale . The geometric center frequency corresponds to a mapping of the DC response of the prototype lowpass filter , which is a resonant frequency sometimes equal to the peak frequency of such systems , for example as in a Butterworth filter . The arithmetic definition is used in more general situations , such as in describing passband telecommunication systems , where filters are not necessarily symmetric but are treated on a linear frequency scale for applications such as frequency-division multiplexing .",
  "/wiki/Hertz": "The hertz ( symbol : Hz ) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is defined as one cycle per second . It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz , the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves . Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples : kilohertz ( 103 Hz , kHz ) , megahertz ( 106 Hz , MHz ) , gigahertz ( 109 Hz , GHz ) , terahertz ( 1012 Hz , THz ) , petahertz ( 1015 Hz , PHz ) , exahertz ( 1018 Hz , EHz ) , and zettahertz ( 1021 Hz , ZHz ) . Some of the unit 's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones , particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications . It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven . The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy , via the photon energy equation ( E=h\u03bd ) , with one hertz equivalent to h joules .",
  "/wiki/City_of_license": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",
  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power ( ERP ) , synonymous with equivalent radiated power , is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency ( RF ) power , such as that emitted by a radio transmitter . It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity ( signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter ) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam ( main lobe ) . ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction . It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna . It is used in electronics and telecommunications , particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area . An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is equivalent ( sometimes effective ) isotropically radiated power ( EIRP ) . Equivalent isotropically radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same ( equivalent ) signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam . The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna , while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna . Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 ( or 2.15 dB ) compared to an isotropic radiator , if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes": "This is a list of broadcast station classes applicable in much of North America under international agreements between the United States , Canada and Mexico . Effective radiated power ( ERP ) and height above average terrain ( HAAT ) are listed unless otherwise noted . All radio and television stations within 320 kilometers ( about 200 miles ) of the US-Canada or US-Mexico border must get approval by both the domestic and foreign agency . These agencies are Industry Canada/Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) in Canada , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) in the US , and the Federal Telecommunications Institute ( IFT ) in Mexico .",

The city is southeast of downtown Salt Lake City and from Salt Lake City 's east edge of Sugar House along Interstate 80 . The population was 7,558 at the 2010 census . On average , the tourist population greatly exceeds the number of permanent residents . After a population decline following the shutdown of the area 's mining industry , the city rebounded during the 1980s and 1990s through an expansion of its tourism business . The city currently brings in a yearly average of $ 529.8 million to the Utah Economy as a tourist hot spot , $ 80 million of which is attributed to the Sundance Film Festival . The city has two major ski resorts : Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain Resort . Both ski resorts were the major locations for ski and snowboarding events at the 2002 Winter Olympics . Although they receive less snow and have a shorter ski season than do their counterparts in Salt Lake County , such as Snowbird resort , they are much easier to access . In 2015 , Park City Ski Resort and Canyons resorts merged creating the largest ski area in the U.S . In all , the resort boasts 17 slopes , 14 bowls , 300 trails and 22 miles of lifts .",
