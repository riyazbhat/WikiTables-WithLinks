In the early 1970s , the brothers began releasing solo recordings , and in 1973 they officially broke up .

  "/wiki/Wings_(band)": "Paul McCartney and Wings ( also known by their original name Wings ) were a British-American rock band formed in 1971 by former Beatle Paul McCartney , his wife Linda on keyboards , session drummer Denny Seiwell , and former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine . Wings were noted for frequent personnel changes along with their commercial successes , going through three lead guitarists and four drummers . However , the core trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained intact throughout the group 's existence . Created following the McCartneys ' 1971 album Ram , the band 's first two albums , Wild Life ( 1971 ) and Red Rose Speedway ( 1973 ) ( the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough ) , were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul 's work with the Beatles . After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die , McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band . The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973 's Band on the Run , a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in Jet and the title track . Following that album , the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton , only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English . With the new line-up , Wings released 1975 's Venus and Mars , which included the US number one single Listen to What the Man Said , and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975-76 .

  "/wiki/Give_Ireland_Back_to_the_Irish": "Give Ireland Back to the Irish is a song by the British-American rock band Wings that was released as their debut single in February 1972 . It was written by Paul McCartney and his wife Linda in response to the events of Bloody Sunday , on 30 January that year , when British troops in Northern Ireland shot dead thirteen civil rights protestors . Keen to voice their outrage at the killings , Wings recorded the track two days later at Abbey Road Studios in London . It was the band 's first song to include Northern Irish guitarist Henry McCullough . Give Ireland Back to the Irish was banned from broadcast in the UK by the BBC and other organisations , and was overlooked by the majority of radio programmers in the United States . The single peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and number 21 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , but topped the national chart in Ireland . Having never released an overtly political song before , McCartney was condemned by the British media for his seemingly pro-IRA stance on Northern Ireland . As with Wings ' recent album , Wild Life , the song was also maligned by many music critics . These writers found McCartney 's lyrics overly simplistic and viewed the single as an attempt by him to gain credibility for his new band on the back of a pressing political issue . Wings performed Give Ireland Back to the Irish throughout their tour of English and Welsh universities in February 1972 . The track first appeared on an album in 1993 , when it was included as a bonus track on the CD reissue of Wild Life . Following a terrorist incident in London in 2001 , McCartney agreed to omit the song from the box set , recognising that its inclusion might be viewed as a gesture of support for the IRA 's use of violence .",
