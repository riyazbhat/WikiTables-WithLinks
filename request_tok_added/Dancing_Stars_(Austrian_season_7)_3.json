  "/wiki/Association_football": "Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , [ a ] is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players . It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies , making it the world 's most popular sport . The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end . The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal . Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The ball is 68-70 cm ( 27-28 in ) in circumference and known as the football . The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other team 's goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks . Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play , except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area . Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball , but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms . The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins .",

  "/wiki/Schlager_music": "Schlager music ( , hit ( s ) ) is a style of popular music that is generally a catchy instrumental accompaniment to vocal pieces of pop music with simple , happy-go-lucky , and often sentimental lyrics . It is prevalent in Central and Northern Europe , and Southeast Europe ( in particular Germany , Austria , Albania , Bulgaria , Finland , Slovenia , Serbia , Croatia , Poland , Hungary , Romania , Switzerland , Scandinavia , and the Baltic States ) , and also ( to a lesser extent ) in France , Belgium , Netherlands , and the UK . In the United States it is also known as 'entertainer music ' or 'German hit mix ' . Typical schlager tracks are either sweet , sentimental ballads with a simple , catchy melody or light pop tunes . Lyrics typically center on love , relationships , and feelings . The northern variant of schlager ( notably in Finland ) has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic folk songs , with lyrics tending towards melancholic and elegiac themes . Musically , schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening . The German word Schlager ( itself a calque of the English word hit ) is also a loanword in some other languages ( Hungarian , Lithuanian , Russian , Hebrew , Romanian , for example ) , where it retained its meaning of a ( musical ) hit . The style has been frequently represented at the Eurovision Song Contest and has been popular since the contest began in 1956 , although it is gradually being replaced by other pop music styles . Over time , schlager music has gradually shifted on to electronic music rather than generic pop music , due to its widespread use of synthesizers throughout its various implementations in recent decades .",
