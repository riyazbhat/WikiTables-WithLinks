  "/wiki/Sama-Bajau": "The Sama-Bajau refers to several Austronesian ethnic groups of Maritime Southeast Asia with their origins from the southern Philippines . The name collectively refers to related people who usually call themselves the Sama or Samah ( formally A ' a Sama , Sama people ) ; or are known by the exonym Bajau ( , also spelled Badjao , Bajaw , Badjau , Badjaw , Bajo or Bayao ) . They usually live a seaborne lifestyle , and use small wooden sailing vessels such as the perahu ( layag in Meranau ) , djenging ( balutu ) , lepa , and vinta ( pilang ) . Some Sama-Bajau groups native to Sabah are also known for their traditional horse culture . The Sama-Bajau are the dominant ethnic group of the islands of Tawi-Tawi in the Philippines . They are also found in other islands of the Sulu Archipelago , coastal areas of Mindanao , northern and eastern Borneo , Sulawesi , and throughout eastern Indonesian islands . In the Philippines , they are grouped together with the religiously-similar Moro people . Within the last fifty years , many of the Filipino Sama-Bajau have migrated to neighbouring Malaysia and the northern islands of the Philippines , due to the conflict in Mindanao . As of 2010 , they were the second-largest ethnic group in the Malaysian state of Sabah . Sama-Bajau have sometimes been called the Sea Gypsies or Sea Nomads , terms that have also been used for non-related ethnic groups with similar traditional lifestyles , such as the Moken of the Burmese-Thai Mergui Archipelago and the Orang laut of southeastern Sumatra and the Riau Islands of Indonesia . The modern outward spread of the Sama-Bajau from older inhabited areas seems to have been associated with the development of sea trade in sea cucumber ( trepang ) .",
  "/wiki/San_people": "The San or Saan peoples , also known as the Bushmen ( also S\u0101khoen , Sonqua , and in Afrikaans : Boesmans , after Dutch Boschjesmens ; and Saake in the N\u01c1ng language ) , are members of various Khoisan-speaking indigenous hunter-gatherer groups that are the first nations of Southern Africa , and whose territories span Botswana , Namibia , Angola , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Lesotho and South Africa . There is a significant linguistic difference between the northern peoples living between the Okavango River in Botswana and Etosha National Park in northwestern Namibia , extending up into southern Angola ; the central peoples of most of Namibia and Botswana , extending into Zambia and Zimbabwe ; and the southern people in the central Kalahari towards the Molopo River , who are the last remnant of the previously extensive indigenous S\u0101n of South Africa . The ancestors of the hunter-gatherer S\u0101n are thought to have been the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa . The historical presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana 's Tsodilo Hills region . In this area , stone tools and rock art paintings date back over 70,000 years and are by far the oldest known art . S\u0101n were traditionally semi-nomadic , moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water , game animals , and edible plants . As of 2010 , the S\u0101n populations in Botswana number about 50,000 to 60,000.:5 From the 1950s through to the 1990s , S\u0101n communities switched to farming because of government-mandated modernisation programs . Despite the lifestyle changes , they have provided a wealth of information in anthropology and genetics . One broad study of African genetic diversity completed in 2009 found that S\u0101n people were among the five populations with the highest measured levels of genetic diversity among the 121 distinct African populations sampled . Certain S\u0101n groups are one of 14 known extant ancestral population clusters . That is , groups of populations with common genetic ancestry , who share ethnicity and similarities in both their culture and the properties of their languages . Despite some positive aspects of government development programs reported by members of S\u0101n and Bakgalagadi communities in Botswana , many have spoken of a consistent sense of exclusion from government decision-making processes , and many S\u0101n and Bakgalagadi have alleged experiencing ethnic discrimination on the part of the government .",
  "/wiki/Kalahari": "The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for , covering much of Botswana , parts of Namibia and regions of South Africa . It is not to be confused with the Angolan , Namibian and South African Namib coastal desert , whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means vast place .",
  "/wiki/Inuit": "Inuit ( /\u02c8\u026anju\u026at/ ; syllabics : \u1403\u14c4\u1403\u1466 , the people , singular : Inuk \u1403\u14c4\u1483 , dual : Inuuk \u1403\u14c5\u1483 [ failed verification ] ) are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland , Canada and Alaska ( United States ) . The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family . Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut . Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut , Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec , Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador , and in various parts of the Northwest Territories , particularly around the Arctic Ocean , in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region . [ note 1 ] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat . In Canada , sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis . The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada , as these people migrated to the east through the continent . Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens , although not the citizens of the European Union . In the United States , the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat , live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island . In Canada and the United States , the term Eskimo was commonly used to describe Inuit , and Siberia and Alaska 's Yupik , I\u00f1upiat , and Chukchi people . However , Inuit is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi , and Eskimo is the only term that applies to Yupik , Chukchi , I\u00f1upiat and Inuit . Since the late 20th century , Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider Eskimo to be a pejorative term , and they more frequently identify as Inuit for an autonym .",
  "/wiki/Zulus": "The Zulu ( ; Zulu : amaZulu ) , or also known as Amazulu , are a Bantu ethnic group of Southern Africa . The Zulu are the largest ethnic group in South Africa with an estimated 10-12 million people living mainly in the province of KwaZulu-Natal . The Zulu originated from Ngini communities who took part in the Bantu migrations . As the clans integrated together , the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to his perfected military policies . The Zulu take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga , or Reed Dance , and their various forms of beadwork . The art and skill of beadwork takes part in the identification of Zulu people and acts as a form of communication . The men and women both serve different purposes in society in order to function as a whole . The Zulu predominately believe in Christianity , but have created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu 's prior belief systems .",
  "/wiki/Q'Ero": "Q'ero ( spelled Q'iru in the official three-vowel Quechua orthography ) is a Quechua-speaking community or ethnic group dwelling in the province of Paucartambo , in the Cusco Region of Peru . The Q'ero became more widely known due to the 1955 ethnological expedition of Dr. Oscar Nu\u00f1ez del Prado of the San Antonio Abad National University in Cusco , after which the myth of the Inkarr\u00ed was published for the first time . Nu\u00f1ez del Prado first met the Q'ero at a festival in the town of Paucartambo , about 120 km away .",

Mentawai also have very strong belief towards objects they think are holy . The people are characterized by their heavy spirituality , body art and their tendency to sharpen their teeth , a practice they feel makes one beautiful . Mentawai tend to live in unison and peace with the nature around them because they believe that all things in nature have some kind of spiritual essence ."
