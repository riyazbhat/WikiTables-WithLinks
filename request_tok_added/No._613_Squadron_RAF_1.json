  "/wiki/Squadron_Leader": "Squadron leader ( Sqn Ldr in the RAF ; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF ; formerly sometimes S/L in all services ) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence . It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure . An air force squadron leader ranks above flight lieutenant and immediately below wing commander and it is the most junior of the senior officer ranks . The air force rank of squadron leader has a NATO ranking code of OF-3 , equivalent to a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Navy or a major in the British Army or the Royal Marines . The equivalent rank in the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force , Women 's Royal Air Force ( until 1968 ) and Princess Mary 's Royal Air Force Nursing Service ( until 1980 ) was squadron officer . Squadron leader has also been used as a cavalry command appointment ( UK ) and rank ( France ) since at least the nineteenth century . In Argentina it is used as a command appointment by both the army 's cavalry and by the air force 's flying units . The cavalry rank of squadron leader in France is also an OF-4 equivalent to a major , and the cavalry appointment of squadron leader in the UK generally corresponds to this rank as well .",

  "/wiki/Medal_bar": "A medal bar or medal clasp is a thin metal bar attached to the ribbon of a military decoration , civil decoration , or other medal . It most commonly indicates the campaign or operation the recipient received the award for , and multiple bars on the same medal are used to indicate that the recipient has met the criteria for receiving the medal in multiple theatres . When used in conjunction with decorations for exceptional service , such as gallantry medals , the term and bar means that the award has been bestowed multiple times . In the example , Group Captain Leonard Cheshire , VC , OM , DSO and two bars , DFC , DSO and two bars means that the Distinguished Service Order was awarded on three separate occasions . A British convention is to indicate bars by the use of asterisks ; thus , DSO** would denote a DSO and two bars . Bars are also used on long-service medals to indicate the length of service rendered . The two terms are used because terms bar and clasp both refer to two parts of the medal ; the indicator discussed in this article , and the part of the medal connected to the ribbon ."
