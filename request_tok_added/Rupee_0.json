One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) .

  "/wiki/Partition_of_India": "The partition of India in 1947 was the division of British India into two independent dominion states , the Union of India and the Dominion of Pakistan . The Union of India is today the Republic of India ; the Dominion of Pakistan is today the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People 's Republic of Bangladesh . The partition involved the division of two provinces , Bengal and the Punjab , based on district-wise Non-Muslim or Muslim majorities . Also divided between the two new dominions were the British Indian Army , the Royal Indian Navy , the Indian Civil Service , the railways , and the central treasury . The partition was set forth in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj , or Crown rule in India . The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 14-15 August 1947 . The partition displaced between 10-12 million people along religious lines , creating overwhelming refugee crises in the newly constituted dominions ; there was large-scale violence , with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million . The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to the present . The term partition of India does not cover the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 , nor the earlier separations of Burma ( now Myanmar ) and Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) from the administration of British India . The term also does not cover the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions , nor the disputes of annexation or division arising in the princely states of Hyderabad , Junagadh , and Jammu and Kashmir , though violence along religious lines did break out in some princely states at the time of the partition . It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of French India into India during the period 1947-1954 , nor the annexation of Goa and other districts of Portuguese India by India in 1961 . Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947 , Sikkim , Bhutan , Nepal , and the Maldives were unaffected by the partition .",
