  "/wiki/Kit_(association_football)": "In association football , kit ( also referred to as a strip or uniform ) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players . The sport 's Laws of the Game specify the minimum kit which a player must use , and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant . Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions , such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that , in the event of a match between teams with identical or similar colours , the away team must change to different coloured attire . Footballers generally wear identifying numbers on the backs of their shirts . Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11 , corresponding roughly to their playing positions , but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering , whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season . Professional clubs also usually display players ' surnames or nicknames on their shirts , above ( or , infrequently , below ) their squad numbers . Football kit has evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts , knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots . In the twentieth century , boots became lighter and softer , shorts were worn at a shorter length , and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs . With the rise of advertising in the 20th century , sponsors ' logos began to appear on shirts , and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase , generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs .",
