  "/wiki/UGC_6945": "UGC 6945 ( also known as Arp 194 ) is a trio of interacting galaxies . The highly disrupted galaxy to the northwest is actually two galaxies in the advanced stages of merger , and has an angular size of . About 40\u2033 to the southeast is a third galaxy with an angular size of . Based upon a radial velocity of about 10,500 km s , the interacting pair of galaxies at the northwest are located at a distance of from us ( assuming a Hubble constant value of ) . If we further assume that the third galaxy lies at the same distance away from us , we find that the galaxies are separated by a projected linear distance of roughly , though later findings from Hubble may cast this assumption into doubt ( see below ) As the pair of galaxies in the north gravitationally interact with each other , tidally-stripped gas from both galaxies is draped over the southern galaxy as a series of blobs , which are fueling a burst of star formation . While it has long been believed to be interacting with the northern galaxy , images from the Hubble Space Telescope clearly show that this stream of material is actually superimposed on the southern galaxy . This suggests that this third galaxy may actually lie in the background . Due to this uncertainty , the third galaxy may not be involved in the interaction .",

  "/wiki/NGC_1134": "NGC 1134 is a spiral galaxy in the Aries constellation . It has a highly inclined disk , with respect to the line of sight from Earth . There is a weak outer extension of the spiral structure in this galaxy . It has been listed in the Arp Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies ( Arp number 200 ) , under the Galaxies with material ejected from nuclei section . NGC 1134 is classified as a galaxy with reduced surface brightness , and it possesses a distinct bulge in its centre , as judged by photometric analysis . It has a small and distant companion about 7 ' to the south .",
  "/wiki/Spiral_galaxy": "Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae and , as such , form part of the Hubble sequence . Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat , rotating disk containing stars , gas and dust , and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge . These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars , many of which reside in globular clusters . Spiral galaxies are named by their spiral structures that extend from the center into the galactic disc . The spiral arms are sites of ongoing star formation and are brighter than the surrounding disc because of the young , hot OB stars that inhabit them . Roughly two-thirds of all spirals are observed to have an additional component in the form of a bar-like structure , extending from the central bulge , at the ends of which the spiral arms begin . The proportion of barred spirals relative to their barless cousins has likely changed over the history of the Universe , with only about 10% containing bars about 8 billion years ago , to roughly a quarter 2.5 billion years ago , until present , where over two-thirds of the galaxies in the visible universe ( Hubble volume ) have bars . The Milky Way is a barred spiral , although the bar itself is difficult to observe from Earth 's current position within the galactic disc . The most convincing evidence for the stars forming a bar in the galactic center comes from several recent surveys , including the Spitzer Space Telescope . Together with irregular galaxies , spiral galaxies make up approximately 60% of galaxies in today 's universe . They are mostly found in low-density regions and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters .",
  "/wiki/NGC_3432": "NGC 3432 is a spiral galaxy that can be found in the constellation Leo Minor . It is currently interacting with UGC 5983 , a dwarf galaxy . Tidal filaments and intense star formation can also been seen from the interaction , which is why it was listed in Halton Arp 's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies .",
  "/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy": "A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of about 100 million up to several billion stars , a small number compared to the Milky Way 's 200-400 billion stars . The Large Magellanic Cloud , which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30 billion stars , is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy ; others consider it a full-fledged galaxy . Dwarf galaxies ' formation and activity are thought to be heavily influenced by interactions with larger galaxies . Astronomers identify numerous types of dwarf galaxies , based on their shape and composition ."
