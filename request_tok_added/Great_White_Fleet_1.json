The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with dozens of dormant volcanic cones . The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour on the Pacific Ocean .

  "/wiki/Insular_Government_of_the_Philippine_Islands": "The Insular Government of the Philippine Islands was a territorial government of the United States that was established in 1901 and was dissolved in 1935 . The Insular Government was preceded by the United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands and was followed by the Commonwealth of the Philippines . The Philippines were acquired by the United States in 1898 as a result of the Spanish-American War . In 1902 , the United States Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act , which organized the government and served as its basic law . This act provided for a governor-general appointed by the president of the United States , as well as a bicameral Philippine Legislature with the appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house and a fully elected , fully Filipino elected lower house , the Philippine Assembly . The term insular refers to the fact that the government operated under the authority of the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs . Puerto Rico and Guam also had insular governments at this time . From 1901 to 1922 , the U.S. Supreme Court wrestled with the constitutional status of these governments in the Insular Cases . In Dorr v. United States ( 1904 ) , the court ruled that Filipinos did not have a constitutional right to trial by jury . In the Philippines itself , the term insular had limited usage . On banknotes , postage stamps , and the coat of arms , the government referred to itself simply as the Philippine Islands . The 1902 Philippine Organic Act was replaced in 1916 by the Jones Law , which ended the Philippine Commission and provided for both houses of the Philippine Legislature to be elected .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

It is divided into six districts : Huli , Siming , Jimei , Tong'an , Haicang , and Xiang'an . Altogether , these cover an area of 1,699.39 square kilometers ( 656.14 sq mi ) with a population of 3,531,347 as of 2010 . The urbanized area of the city has spread from its original island to include parts of all six of its districts , with a total population of 1,861,289 . This area connects to Quanzhou in the north and Zhangzhou in the west , making up a metropolis of more than five million people . The Kinmen Islands ( Quemoy ) administered by the Republic of China lie less than 6 kilometers ( 4 mi ) away . Xiamen Island possessed a natural harbor in Yundang Bay , but Fujian 's international trade was long restricted to Quanzhou or to Guangzhou in Guangdong . Due to the siltification of Quanzhou 's harbor , the British insisted that Xiamen be opened to foreign trade in the treaty that ended the First Opium War in 1842 . Under the Qing , both before and after the war , there was a large-scale emigration of Chinese from southern Fujian who spread Hokkien-speaking communities to Singapore , Malaysia ( especially in Penang ) , Indonesia ( Medan and Riau Province ) and the Philippines . The overseas Chinese continue to support Xiamen 's educational and cultural institutions . As part of the Opening Up Policy under Deng Xiaoping , Xiamen became one of China 's original four special economic zones opened to foreign investment and trade in the early 1980s . Its former harbor was enclosed using land excavated during the city 's expansion , however , the city remains an island connected by bridges to the rest of mainland China .",
  "/wiki/Qing_dynasty": "The Qing dynasty , officially the Great Qing ( [ t\u0255\u02b0i\u0301\u014b ] ) , was the last imperial dynasty of China . It was established in 1636 , and ruled China proper from 1644 to 1911 . It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China . The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted for almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for modern China . It was the fifth largest empire in world history . The dynasty was founded by the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing Banners , military-social units that included Manchu , Han , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci united Manchu clans and officially proclaimed the Later Jin dynasty in 1616 . His son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of the Liaodong Peninsula and declared a new dynasty , the Qing , in 1636 . As Ming control disintegrated , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the capital , Beijing , in 1644 . Ming general Wu Sangui refused to serve them , but opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Dorgon served as Prince Regent under the Shunzhi Emperor and implemented policies of rule ."
