  "/wiki/Hip_hop": "Hip hop or hip-hop , is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans , Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx , New York City . The origin of the name is often disputed . It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx . While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music ( including rap ) , hip hop is characterized by nine elements , of which only four are considered essential to understanding hip hop musically . Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined these main pillars of hip hop culture , coining the terms : rapping ( also called MCing or emceeing ) , a rhythmic vocal rhyming style ( orality ) ; DJing ( and turntablism ) , which is making music with record players and DJ mixers ( aural/sound and music creation ) ; b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing ( movement/dance ) ; and graffiti . Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are : hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement ( intellectual/philosophical ) ; beatboxing , a percussive vocal style ; street entrepreneurship ; hip hop language ; and hip hop fashion and style , among others . The fifth element , although debated , is commonly considered either street knowledge , hip hop fashion , or beatboxing . The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Black Spades , an African-American group that has been described as being a gang , a club , and a music group . Brother-sister duo Clive Campbell , a.k.a . DJ Kool Herc , and Cindy Campbell additionally hosted DJ parties in the Bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre . Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world . These elements were adapted and developed considerably , particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades .",

  "/wiki/Ballad": "A ballad is a form of verse , often a narrative set to music . Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson ballad\u00e9e or ballade , which were originally dance songs . Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of Britain and Ireland from the later medieval period until the 19th century . They were widely used across Europe , and later in Australia , North Africa , North America and South America . Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form , consisting of couplets ( two lines ) of rhymed verse , each of 14 syllables . Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated , in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines . Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides . The form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads . In the later 19th century , the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and is often used for any love song , particularly the sentimental ballad of pop or rock music , although the term is also associated with the concept of a stylized storytelling song or poem , particularly when used as a title for other media such as a film .",

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",

  "/wiki/K-Pop": "K-pop ( abbreviation of Korean pop ; ) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea . While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s , the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s , replacing the term Gayo ( \uac00\uc694 ) , which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea . Although it generally indicates popular music within South Korea , the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world , such as experimental , rock , jazz , gospel , hip hop , R & B , reggae , electronic dance , folk , country , and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots . The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups , Seo Taiji and Boys , in 1992 . Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea 's contemporary music scene . Modern K-pop idol culture began with the boy band H.O.T . in 1996 , as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults . After a slump in early K-pop , from 2003 TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today . With the advent of online social networking services and Korean TV shows , the current spread of K-pop and Korean entertainment , known as the Korean Wave , is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia , but also in Pakistan , Bangladesh , India , Latin America , North Africa , Southern Africa , the Middle East and throughout the Western world , gaining a widespread global audience .",
  "/wiki/R&B": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",
