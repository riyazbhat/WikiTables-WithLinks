  "/wiki/John_Joe_Rice": "John Joe Rice ( 1893 - 1 July 1970 ) was a soldier during the Irish revolutionary period and Sinn F\u00e9in politician in the 1950s . Born in Kilmurry , Kenmare , County Kerry , Rice was a railway worker who joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 . At the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence , he became Officer Commanding of the 5th Battalion of the Kerry No . 2 Brigade , a unit he would also command during the Irish Civil War , where they fought as part of the Anti-Treaty IRA . He was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la ( TD ) for the Kerry South constituency at the 1957 general election . He did not take his seat in the D\u00e1il , for Sinn F\u00e9in ran on an abstentionist ticket . He was one of four Sinn F\u00e9in TDs elected at the 1957 general election , the others being Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh , John Joe McGirl and Eighneach\u00e1n \u00d3 hAnnluain . During his time as a TD he campaigned against the Special Powers Act , which granted the Irish state extra abilities to deal with and punish suspected members of the IRA . He was defeated at the 1961 general election . In 1966 , he and fellow Kerry Republican John Joe Sheehy were expelled from Sinn F\u00e9in , as were many others , by the new Marxist-Leninist party leadership that had recently come into power . This move both foreshadowed and fuelled the split in 1969/1970 of both the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in , which led to the creation of the Marxist-Leninist Official IRA and the more traditional but still left-wing Provisional IRA , and in parallel Sinn F\u00e9in - The Workers ' Party and Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in . Rice gave his support to the Provisionals ."
