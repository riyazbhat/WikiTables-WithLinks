  "/wiki/English_country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Quoin_(architecture)": "Quoins ( /k\u0254\u026an/ or /kw\u0254\u026an/ ) are masonry blocks at the corner of a wall . Some are structural , providing strength for a wall made with inferior stone or rubble , while others merely add aesthetic detail to a corner . These imply strength , permanence , and expense , all reinforcing the onlooker 's sense of a structure 's presence . Stone quoins are used on stone or brick buildings . Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings , extending from the facing brickwork in such a way as to give the appearance of generally uniformly cut ashlar blocks of stone larger than the bricks . Where quoins are decorative and non load-bearing a wider variety of materials is used , including timber , stucco , or other cement render .",
  "/wiki/String_course": "A belt course , also called a string course or sill course , is a continuous row or layer of stones or brick set in a wall . Set in line with window sills , it helps to make the horizontal line of the sills visually more prominent . Set between the floors of a house , it helps to make the separate floors distinguishable from the exterior of the building . The belt course often projects from the side of the building . Georgian architecture is notable for the use of belt courses . Although the belt course has its origins as a structural component of a building , by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose . In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories , however , a shelf angle is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden , interior steel wall . Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water . Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing , a belt course is often used .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Molding_(architecture)": "Moulding ( also spelled molding in the United States though usually not within the industry ) , also known as coving , is a strip of material with various profiles used to cover transitions between surfaces or for decoration . It is traditionally made from solid milled wood or plaster , but may be of plastic or reformed wood . In classical architecture and sculpture , the molding is often carved in marble or other stones . A plain molding has right-angled upper and lower edges . A sprung molding has upper and lower edges that bevel towards its rear , allowing mounting between two non-parallel planes ( such as a wall and a ceiling ) , with an open space behind . Moldings may be decorated with paterae as long , uninterrupted elements may be boring for eyes .",
  "/wiki/Architrave": "In classical architecture , an architrave ( /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rk\u026atre\u026av/ ; from Italian : architrave chief beam , also called an epistyle ; from Greek \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd epistylon door frame ) is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of columns . The term can also apply to all sides , including the vertical members , of a frame with mouldings around a door or window . The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings ( or other elements ) framing the top of a door , window or other rectangular opening , where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join ( forming a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint ) .",
  "/wiki/Pediment": "A pediment is an architectural element found particularly in Classical , Neoclassical and Baroque architecture , and its derivatives , consisting of a gable , usually of a triangular shape , placed above the horizontal structure of the lintel , or entablature , if supported by columns . The tympanum , the triangular area within the pediment , is often decorated with relief sculpture . A pediment is sometimes the top element of a portico . For symmetric designs , it provides a centre point and often used to add grandness to entrances .",
  "/wiki/Corbel": "In architecture , a corbel is a structural piece of stone , wood or metal jutting from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight , a type of bracket . A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall , whereas a console is a piece applied to the structure . A piece of timber projecting in the same way was called a tassel or a bragger in England .",
  "/wiki/Sash_window": "A sash window or hung sash window is made of one or more movable panels , or sashes , [ A ] that form a frame to hold panes of glass , which are often separated from other panes ( or lights ) by glazing bars , also known as muntins in the US ( moulded strips of wood ) . Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash , the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically , or horizontally in a style known as a Yorkshire light , sliding sash , or sash and case ( so called because the weights are concealed in a box case ) .",
  "/wiki/Keystone_(architecture)": "A keystone ( also known as capstone ) is the wedge-shaped stone at the apex of a masonry arch or typically round-shaped one at the apex of a vault . In both cases it is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position , allowing the arch or vault to bear weight . In arches and vaults ( such as quasi-domes ) keystones are often enlarged beyond the structural requirements and decorated . A variant in domes and crowning vaults is a lantern . Keystones , as a hallmark of strength or good architecture , or their suggested form are sometimes placed in the centre of the flat top of doors , recesses and windows for decorative effect , so as to form an upward projection of a lintel . Although a masonry arch or vault can not be self-supporting until the keystone is placed , the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs , due to its position at the apex . Old keystones can decay due to vibration , a condition known as bald arch . In a rib-vaulted ceiling , keystones commonly mark the intersections of any two or more arched ribs . For aesthetics , keystones are often larger than ribs in vaults and many of the voussoirs ( arch stones ) in arches , or embellished with a boss . Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones , as in the church house entrance portal at Colditz Castle ( see image ) . Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio , a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect .",
  "/wiki/Dormer": "A dormer is a roofed structure , often containing a window , that projects vertically beyond the plane of a pitched roof . A dormer window is a form of roof window . Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane . The term dormer is commonly used to refer to a dormer window although a dormer does not necessarily contain a window . A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion . As a prominent element of many buildings , different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture . When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals , it is usually referred to as a lucarne .",
  "/wiki/Dutch_gable": "A Dutch gable or Flemish gable is a gable whose sides have a shape made up of one or more curves and has a pediment at the top . The gable may be an entirely decorative projection above a flat section of roof line , or may be the termination of a roof , like a normal gable ( the picture of Montacute House , right , shows both types ) . The preceding is the strict definition , but the term is sometimes used more loosely , though the stepped gable should be distinguished from it . The term Dutch gable is also used in America and Australasia to refer to a gablet roof . The Dutch gable was a notable feature of the Renaissance architecture , which spread to northern Europe from the Low Countries , arriving in Britain during the latter part of the 16th century . Later Dutch gables with flowing curves became absorbed into Baroque architecture . Examples of Dutch-gabled buildings can be found in historic cities across Europe . In Potsdam , Germany , 150 red brick houses featuring steep Dutch gables form part of the city 's Dutch Quarter , while in Bruges , Belgium , a wide range of buildings featuring Dutch gables can be found . The Flemish culture also had a strong architectural impact in Arras , northern France . The style also spread beyond Europe , for example Barbados is well known for the Dutch gables on its historic buildings . Dutch settlers in South Africa also brought with them building styles from the Netherlands which included the use of prominent Dutch gables but adjusted to the Western Cape region where the style became known as Cape Dutch architecture . The formation of Dutch gables requires careful detailing , to weatherproof the junction of the roof with the inner face of the Dutch gable wall with a flashing ( weatherproofing ) .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Hipped_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid .

Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Rustication_(architecture)": "In classical architecture rustication is a range of masonry techniques giving visible surfaces a finish that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished , squared-block masonry surfaces called ashlar . The visible face of each individual block is cut back around the edges to make its size and placing very clear . In addition the central part of the face of each block may be given a deliberately rough or patterned surface . Rusticated masonry is usually dressed , or squared off neatly , on all sides of the stones except the face that will be visible when the stone is put in place . This is given wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block , by angling the edges ( channel-jointed ) , or dropping them back a little . The main part of the exposed face may be worked flat and smooth or left with , or worked , to give a more or less rough or patterned surface . Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above . Though intended to convey a rustic simplicity , the finish is highly artificial , and the faces of the stones often carefully worked to achieve an appearance of a coarse finish . Rustication was used in ancient times , but became especially popular in the revived classical styles of Italian Renaissance architecture and that of subsequent periods , above all in the lower floors of secular buildings . It remains in use in some modern architecture . Similar finishes are very common in medieval architecture , especially in castles , walls and similar buildings , but here it merely arises from an unwillingness to spend the extra money required for ashlar masonry in a particular building , and lacks the deliberate emphasis on the joints between blocks . Though it often achieves a decorative effect , this is something of a by-product , and the exploitation for architectural effect within a single building of contrasts between rusticated and ashlar surfaces is rarely seen .",
  "/wiki/Voussoir": "A voussoir is a wedge-shaped element , typically a stone , which is used in building an arch or vault . Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir , two units are of distinct functional importance : the keystone and the springer . The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch . The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side , located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier . The keystone is often decorated or enlarged . An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in Mannerist arches of the 16th century , beginning with the works of Giulio Romano , who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings , rather than a lintel ( Palazzo Stati Maccarani , Rome , circa 1522 ) . The word is a mason 's term borrowed in Middle English from French verbs connoting a 'turn ' ( OED ) . Each wedge-shaped voussoir turns aside the thrust of the mass above , transferring it from stone to stone to the springer 's bottom face ( 'impost ' ) , which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports . Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently , and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone , as in an arch bridge . In Visigothic and Moorish architectural traditions , the voussoirs are often in alternating colours , usually red and white . This is sometimes found in Romanesque architecture also . During the 18th and 19th centuries , British bricklayers became aware that , by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top , they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former ' , or over specially constructed timber falsework ( temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete ) .",
  "/wiki/Dovecote": "A dovecote or dovecot /\u02c8d\u028cvk\u0252t/ or doocot ( Scots : doocot ) is a structure intended to house pigeons or doves . Dovecotes may be free-standing structures in a variety of shapes , or built into the end of a house or barn . They generally contain pigeonholes for the birds to nest . Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically in the Middle East and Europe and were kept for their eggs and dung .",
  "/wiki/Weathervane": "A weather vane , wind vane , or weathercock is an instrument used for showing the direction of the wind . It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building . The word vane comes from the Old English word fana , meaning 'flag ' . Although partly functional , weather vanes are generally decorative , often featuring the traditional cockerel design with letters indicating the points of the compass . Other common motifs include ships , arrows and horses . Not all weather vanes have pointers . When the wind is sufficiently strong , the head of the arrow or cockerel ( or equivalent depending on the chosen design ) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing . The weather vane was independently invented in ancient China and Greece around the same time during the 2nd century BCE . The earliest written reference to a weather vane appears in the Huainanzi , and a weather vane was fitted on top of the Tower of the Winds in Athens .",
  "/wiki/Plinth": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Belt_course": "A belt course , also called a string course or sill course , is a continuous row or layer of stones or brick set in a wall .

Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water . Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing , a belt course is often used .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",
  "/wiki/Entablature": "An entablature ( /\u025bn\u02c8t\u00e6bl\u0259t\u0283\u0259r/ ; nativization of Italian intavolatura , from in in and tavola table ) is the superstructure of moldings and bands which lies horizontally above columns , resting on their capitals . Entablatures are major elements of classical architecture , and are commonly divided into the architrave ( the supporting member immediately above ; equivalent to the lintel in post and lintel construction ) , the frieze ( an unmolded strip that may or may not be ornamented ) , and the cornice ( the projecting member below the pediment ) . The Greek and Roman temples are believed to be based on wooden structures , the design transition from wooden to stone structures being called petrification .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Fanlight": "A fanlight is a window , often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape , with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan . It is placed over another window or a doorway , and is sometimes hinged to a transom . The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst . It is also called a sunburst light .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Buttress": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Embattled": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Casement_window": "A casement is a window that is attached to its frame by one or more hinges at the side . They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame , in which case they are hinged on the outside . Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay . Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows , and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers .",
  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",
  "/wiki/Hood_mould": "In architecture , a hood mould , label mould ( from Latin labia , lip ) , drip mould or dripstone , is an external moulded projection from a wall over an opening to throw off rainwater . This moulding can be terminated at the side by ornamentation called a label stop . The hood mould was introduced into architecture in the Romanesque period , though they became much more common in the Gothic period . Later , with the increase in rectangular windows they became more prevalent in domestic architecture .",

It lies between the towns of Telford and Newport , on the A518 , in the Telford and Wrekin borough and the Wrekin constituency . There is one school in the centre of the village . The village dates back to Anglo-Saxon times , the parish church being founded by St Chad . It is mentioned in the Domesday Book . The Norman parish church of St Michael and All Angels is a grade I listed building . A civil parish was formed in 1 April 2015 from Lilleshall , Donnington and Muxton , though a previous parish also called Lilleshall existed . There is a monument , a cricket club , a tennis club , a church and a primary school clustered around a bracken-covered hill named Lilleshall Hill . Lilleshall Abbey , some distance to the east of the village , was an Augustinian house , founded in the twelfth century , the ruins of which are protected by English Heritage . After the dissolution of the monasteries the estate was bought by the Wolverhampton wool merchant James Leveson . His family held the site for four generations and , after two owners died without issue , it passed into the hands of the related Leveson-Gower family in the late 17th century . Lilleshall is surrounded by farmland .",
  "/wiki/Limestone": "Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral , foraminifera , and molluscs . Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite , which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . A closely related rock is dolomite , which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite , CaMg ( CO3 ) 2 . In old USGS publications , dolomite was referred to as magnesian limestone , a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones .",
  "/wiki/Grinshill": "Grinshill is a small village , and civil parish in Shropshire , England , United Kingdom . The parish is one of the smallest in the district . The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 274 . Grinshill Hill rises above the village to above sea level . Grinshill is near ( east ) to the village of Clive . The A49 runs just further to the east of the village . Stone has been quarried at Grinshill since at least the twelfth century . Grinshill stone is a Triassic sandstone that was described by the Pevsner Architectural Guides as the pre-eminent building stone of Shropshire , and has been used in buildings as varied as Haughmond Abbey , Shrewsbury railway station and Welsh Bridge . Most notably , Grinshill stone has been used to make the lintels and door surround of Number 10 Downing Street and in the building of Chequers . The village church is All Saints .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Clerestory": "In architecture , a clerestory ( /\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259rst\u0254\u02d0ri/ KLEER-stor-ee ; lit . clear storey , also clearstory , clearstorey , or overstorey ) is a high section of wall that contains windows above eye level . The purpose is to admit light , fresh air , or both . Historically , clerestory denoted an upper level of a Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church , the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower aisles and are pierced with windows . Similar structures have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting , ventilation , or headroom .",
  "/wiki/Aisle": "An aisle ( British English : gangway ) is , in general ( common ) , a space for walking with rows of seats on both sides or with rows of seats on one side and a wall on the other . Aisles can be seen in airplanes , certain types of buildings , such as churches , cathedrals , synagogues , meeting halls , parliaments and legislatures , courtrooms , theatres , and in certain types of passenger vehicles . Their floors may be flat or , as in theatres , stepped upwards from a stage . Aisles can also be seen in shops , warehouses , and factories , where rather than seats , they have shelving to either side . In warehouses and factories , aisles may consist of storage pallets , and in factories , aisles may separate work areas . In health clubs , exercise equipment is normally arranged in aisles . Aisles are distinguished [ how ? ] from corridors , hallways , walkways , footpaths/pavements ( American English sidewalks ) , trails , paths and ( enclosed ) open areas .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Pinnacle": "A pinnacle is an architectural ornament originally forming the cap or crown of a buttress or small turret , but afterwards used on parapets at the corners of towers and in many other situations . The pinnacle looks like a small spire . It was mainly used in Gothic architecture . The pinnacle had two purposes :",
  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",
  "/wiki/Mansard_roof": "A mansard or mansard roof ( also called a French roof or curb roof ) is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope , punctured by dormer windows , at a steeper angle than the upper . The steep roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space ( a garret ) , and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable stories . The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building . The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550 . This roof design was popularized in the early 17th century by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart ( 1598-1666 ) , an accomplished architect of the French Baroque period . It became especially fashionable during the Second French Empire ( 1852-1870 ) of Napol\u00e9on III . Mansard in Europe ( France , Germany and elsewhere ) also means the attic or garret space itself , not just the roof shape and is often used in Europe to mean a gambrel roof .",
  "/wiki/Bellcote": "A bell-cot , bell-cote or bellcote is a small framework and shelter for one or more bells . Bellcotes are most common in church architecture but are also seen on institutions such as schools . The bellcote may be carried on brackets projecting from a wall or built on the roof of chapels or churches that have no towers . The bellcote often holds the Sanctus bell that is rung at the consecration of the Eucharist .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",
  "/wiki/Transom_(architecture)": "In architecture , a transom is a transverse horizontal structural beam or bar , or a crosspiece separating a door from a window above it . This contrasts with a mullion , a vertical structural member . Transom or transom window is also the customary U.S. word used for a transom light , the window over this crosspiece . In Britain , the transom light is usually referred to as a fanlight , often with a semi-circular shape , especially when the window is segmented like the slats of a folding hand fan . A well-known example of this is at the main entrance of 10 Downing Street , London ."
