Its counterparts were the Roman equites ( equestrians ) and medieval knights .",
  "/wiki/Astyanax": "In Greek mythology , Astyanax ( ; Asty\u00e1nax , protector of the city ) was the son of Hector , the crown prince of Troy , and his wife , Princess Andromache of Cilician Thebe . His birth name was Scamandrius ( in Greek : \u03a3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Skamandrios , after the river Scamander ) , but the people of Troy nicknamed him Astyanax ( i.e . high king , or overlord of the city ) , because he was the son of the city 's great defender ( Iliad VI , 403 ) and the heir apparent 's firstborn son . During the Trojan War , Andromache hid the child in Hector 's tomb , but the child was discovered . His fate was debated by the Greeks , for if he were allowed to live , it was feared he would avenge his father and rebuild Troy . In the version given by the Little Iliad and repeated by Pausanias ( x 25.4 ) , he was killed by Neoptolemus ( also called Pyrrhus ) , who threw the infant from the walls . Another version is given in Iliou persis , in which Odysseus kills Astyanax . It has also been depicted in some Greek vases that Neoptolemus kills Priam , who has taken refuge near a sacred altar , using Astyanax 's dead body to club the old king to death , in front of horrified onlookers . In Ovid 's Metamorphoses , the child is thrown from the walls by the Greek victors ( 13 , 413ff ) . In Euripides 's The Trojan Women ( 719 ff ) , the herald Talthybius reveals to Andromache that Odysseus has convinced the council to have the child thrown from the walls , and the child is in this way killed . In Seneca 's version of The Trojan Women , the prophet Calchas declares that Astyanax must be thrown from the walls if the Greek fleet is to be allowed favorable winds ( 365-70 ) , but once led to the tower , the child himself leaps off the walls ( 1100-3 ) . For Hector 's mother , Hecuba , Astyanax was the only hope and consolation , and his death 's announcement was a terrible climax of the catastrophe .",

The name would mean desired or lovely , if derived from the same root as Eros , as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica . Erato is the Muse of love poetry . In the Orphic hymn to the Muses , it is Erato who charms the sight . Since the Renaissance she has mostly been shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses , holding a lyre , or a small kithara , a musical instrument often associated with Apollo . In Simon Vouet 's representations , two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet . Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow , reminding one of the eros , the feeling that she inspires in everybody , and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros , holding a torch .",

  "/wiki/Marsyas": "In Greek mythology , the satyr Marsyas ( ; ) is a central figure in two stories involving music : in one , he picked up the double oboe ( aulos ) that had been abandoned by Athena and played it ; in the other , he challenged Apollo to a contest of music and lost his hide and life . In antiquity , literary sources often emphasise the hubris of Marsyas and the justice of his punishment . In one strand of modern comparative mythography , the domination of Marsyas by Apollo is regarded as an example of myth that recapitulates a supposed supplanting by the Olympian pantheon of an earlier Pelasgian religion of chthonic heroic ancestors and nature spirits . Marsyas was a devot\u00e9 of the ancient Mother Goddess Rhea/Cybele , and his episodes are situated by the mythographers in Celaenae ( or Kelainai ) , in Phrygia , at the main source of the Meander ( the river Menderes in Turkey ) .",

In other sources , he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus . Thespis was a singer of dithyrambs ( songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains ) . He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories , distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks . This new style was called tragedy , and Thespis was the most popular exponent of it . Eventually , in 534 BC competitions to find the best tragedy were instituted at the City Dionysia in Athens , and Thespis won the first documented competition . Capitalising on his success , Thespis also invented theatrical touring ; he would tour various cities while carrying his costumes , masks and other props in a horse-drawn wagon .",

Memmius had , while in Athens , procured permission from the Areopagus court to pull down an old wall belonging to the property left by Epicurus for the use of his school . This was regarded by Patro as a sort of desecration , and he accordingly addressed himself to Atticus and Cicero , to induce them to use their influence with the Areopagus to get the decree rescinded . Atticus also wrote to Cicero on the subject . Cicero arrived at Athens the day after Memmius had departed for Mytilene . Finding that Memmius had abandoned his design of erecting the edifice with which the wall in question would have interfered , he consented to help in the matter ; but thinking that the Areopagus would not retract their decree without the consent of Memmius , he wrote to the latter , urging his request in an elegant epistle , which is still in existence .",
