  "/wiki/Mogul_skiing": "Mogul skiing is a freestyle skiing competition consisting of one timed run of free skiing on a steep , heavily moguled course , stressing technical turns , aerial maneuvers and speed . Internationally , the sport is contested at the FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships , and at the Winter Olympic Games . Moguls are a series of bumps on a piste formed when skiers push snow into mounds as they do sharp turns . This tends to happen naturally as skiers use the slope but they can also be constructed artificially . Once formed , a naturally occurring mogul tends to grow as skiers follow similar paths around it , further deepening the surrounding grooves known as troughs . Since skiing tends to be a series of linked turns , moguls form together to create a bump field . The term mogul is from the Bavarian/Austrian German word Mugel , meaning mound , hillock .
