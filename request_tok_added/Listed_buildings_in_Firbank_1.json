  "/wiki/Drystone_wall": "Dry stone , sometimes called drystack or , in Scotland , drystane , is a building method by which structures are constructed from stones without any mortar to bind them together . Dry stone structures are stable because of their unique construction method , which is characterized by the presence of a load-bearing fa\u00e7ade of carefully selected interlocking stones . Dry stone construction is best known in the context of stone walls , traditionally used for the boundaries of fields and churchyards , or as retaining walls for terracing , but dry stone sculptures , buildings , bridges , and other structures also exist . The art of dry stone walling was inscribed in 2018 on the UNESCO representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity , for dry stone walls in countries such as France , Greece , Italy , Croatia , Switzerland and Spain .",
  "/wiki/George_Fox": "George Fox ( July 1624 - 13 January 1691 ) was an English Dissenter , who was a founder of the Religious Society of Friends , commonly known as the Quakers or Friends . The son of a Leicestershire weaver , he lived in times of social upheaval and war . He rebelled against the religious and political authorities by proposing an unusual , uncompromising approach to the Christian faith . He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher , often being persecuted by the disapproving authorities . In 1669 , he married Margaret Fell , widow of a wealthy supporter , Thomas Fell ; she was a leading Friend . His ministry expanded and he made tours of North America and the Low Countries . He was arrested and jailed numerous times for his beliefs . He spent his final decade working in London to organize the expanding Quaker movement . Despite disdain from some Anglicans and Puritans , he was viewed with respect by the Quaker convert William Penn and the Lord Protector , Oliver Cromwell .",
  "/wiki/A684_road": "The A684 is an A road that runs through Cumbria and North Yorkshire , starting at Kendal , Cumbria and ending at Ellerbeck and the A19 road in North Yorkshire . It crosses the full width of the Yorkshire Dales , passing through Garsdale and the full length of Wensleydale . Flooding can be a problem after heavy rain , especially at Appersett , near Hawes , and heavy snow can close the road temporarily at the Black Horse hill and in Garsdale .",

  "/wiki/Voussoir": "A voussoir is a wedge-shaped element , typically a stone , which is used in building an arch or vault . Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir , two units are of distinct functional importance : the keystone and the springer . The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch . The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side , located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier . The keystone is often decorated or enlarged . An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in Mannerist arches of the 16th century , beginning with the works of Giulio Romano , who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings , rather than a lintel ( Palazzo Stati Maccarani , Rome , circa 1522 ) . The word is a mason 's term borrowed in Middle English from French verbs connoting a 'turn ' ( OED ) . Each wedge-shaped voussoir turns aside the thrust of the mass above , transferring it from stone to stone to the springer 's bottom face ( 'impost ' ) , which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports . Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently , and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone , as in an arch bridge . In Visigothic and Moorish architectural traditions , the voussoirs are often in alternating colours , usually red and white . This is sometimes found in Romanesque architecture also . During the 18th and 19th centuries , British bricklayers became aware that , by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top , they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former ' , or over specially constructed timber falsework ( temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete ) .",
  "/wiki/Pier_(architecture)": "A pier , in architecture , is an upright support for a structure or superstructure such as an arch or bridge . Sections of structural walls between openings ( bays ) can function as piers .",
  "/wiki/Cutwater": "In architecture , a starling ( or sterling ) or , more commonly , cutwater is a defensive bulwark , usually built with pilings or bricks , surrounding the supports ( or piers ) of a bridge or similar construction . Starlings are shaped to ease the flow of the water around the bridge , reducing the damage caused by erosion or collisions with flood-borne debris , and may also form an important part of the structure of the bridge , spreading the weight of the piers . So the cutwaters make the current of water less forceful . Starlings may form part of a buttress for the vertical load of the bridge piers , and so are symmetrical . Examples such as at the Old Wye Bridge , Chepstow are on lower stretches of rivers which are tidal and that require a starling in both directions . Other starlings may be asymmetrical , so that the upstream aspect of a pier is larger as it a face sloping outwards , whilst downstream is vertical . One problem caused by starlings is the accumulation of river debris , mud and other objects against the starlings , potentially hindering the flow . The starling has a sharpened or curved extreme sometimes called the nose . The cutwater may be of concrete or masonry , but is often capped with a steel angle to resist abrasion and focus force at a single point to fracture floating pieces of ice striking the pier . In cold climates the starling is typically sloped at an angle of about 45\u00b0 so current pushing against part-submerged ice flow tends to lift the solid ice translating horizontal force of the current to a vertical force shearing the ice allowing the icy flows to pass on either side . A sloped , ice-cutting starling is known as a starkwater .",
  "/wiki/Buttress": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Packhorse_bridge": "A packhorse bridge is a bridge intended to carry packhorses ( horses loaded with sidebags or panniers ) across a river or stream . Typically a packhorse bridge consists of one or more narrow ( one horse wide ) masonry arches , and has low parapets so as not to interfere with the panniers borne by the horses . Multi-arched examples sometimes have triangular cutwaters that are extended upward to form pedestrian refuges . :24-25 Packhorse bridges were often built on the trade routes ( often called packhorse routes ) that formed major transport arteries across Europe and Great Britain until the coming of the turnpike roads and canals in the 18th century . Before the road-building efforts of Napoleon , all crossings of the Alps were on packhorse trails . Travellers ' carriages were dismantled and transported over the mountain passes by ponies and mule trains .",
  "/wiki/Abutment": "In engineering , abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam whereon the structure 's superstructure rests or contacts . Single-span bridges have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge , as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach . Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments . Dam abutments are generally either side of a valley or gorge but may be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan . The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch , or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault . The impost or abacus of a column in classical architecture may also serve as an abutment to an arch . The word derives from the verb , meaning to touch by means of a mutual border .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Sash_window": "A sash window or hung sash window is made of one or more movable panels , or sashes , [ A ] that form a frame to hold panes of glass , which are often separated from other panes ( or lights ) by glazing bars , also known as muntins in the US ( moulded strips of wood ) . Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash , the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically , or horizontally in a style known as a Yorkshire light , sliding sash , or sash and case ( so called because the weights are concealed in a box case ) .",
  "/wiki/Quoin_(architecture)": "Quoins ( /k\u0254\u026an/ or /kw\u0254\u026an/ ) are masonry blocks at the corner of a wall . Some are structural , providing strength for a wall made with inferior stone or rubble , while others merely add aesthetic detail to a corner . These imply strength , permanence , and expense , all reinforcing the onlooker 's sense of a structure 's presence . Stone quoins are used on stone or brick buildings . Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings , extending from the facing brickwork in such a way as to give the appearance of generally uniformly cut ashlar blocks of stone larger than the bricks . Where quoins are decorative and non load-bearing a wider variety of materials is used , including timber , stucco , or other cement render .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Casement_window": "A casement is a window that is attached to its frame by one or more hinges at the side . They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame , in which case they are hinged on the outside . Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay . Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows , and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",

  "/wiki/Turnpike_trusts": "Turnpike trusts were bodies set up by individual acts of Parliament , with powers to collect road tolls for maintaining the principal roads in Britain from the 17th but especially during the 18th and 19th centuries . At the peak , in the 1830s , over 1,000 trusts administered around of turnpike road in England and Wales , taking tolls at almost 8,000 toll-gates and side-bars . During the early 19th century the concept of the turnpike trust was adopted and adapted to manage roads within the British Empire ( Ireland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India , and South Africa ) and in the United States . Turnpikes declined with the coming of the railways and then the Local Government Act 1888 gave responsibility for maintaining main roads to county councils and county borough councils .",

  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Coping_(architecture)": "Coping ( from cope , Latin capa ) consists of the capping or covering of a wall . A splayed or wedge coping slopes in a single direction ; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point . A coping may consist of stone ( capstone ) , brick , clay or terracotta , concrete or cast stone , tile , slate , wood , thatch , or various metals , including aluminum , copper , stainless steel , steel , and zinc . In all cases it should be weathered ( have a slanted or curved top surface ) to throw off the water . Various types of copings exist . A diagrammatic explanation of copper copings is available . In Romanesque work copings appeared plain and flat , and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip . In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering ( mainly on the outer side ) , and began at the top with an astragal ; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off ; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section , and the coping mouldings continued round the sides , as well as at top and bottom , mitring at the angles , as in many of the colleges at Oxford .",
  "/wiki/Finial": "A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object , often formed to be a decorative feature . In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies . The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage ( including semi-formal ceremonies ) . The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Apse": "In architecture , an apse ( plural apses ; from Latin absis : arch , vault from Greek \u1f00\u03c8\u03af\u03c2 apsis arch ; sometimes written apsis , plural apsides ) is a semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome , also known as an exedra . In Byzantine , Romanesque , and Gothic Christian church ( including cathedral and abbey ) architecture , the term is applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building at the liturgical east end ( where the altar is ) , regardless of the shape of the roof , which may be flat , sloping , domed , or hemispherical . Smaller apses may also be in other locations , especially shrines .",
  "/wiki/String_course": "A belt course , also called a string course or sill course , is a continuous row or layer of stones or brick set in a wall . Set in line with window sills , it helps to make the horizontal line of the sills visually more prominent . Set between the floors of a house , it helps to make the separate floors distinguishable from the exterior of the building . The belt course often projects from the side of the building . Georgian architecture is notable for the use of belt courses . Although the belt course has its origins as a structural component of a building , by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose . In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories , however , a shelf angle is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden , interior steel wall . Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water . Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing , a belt course is often used .",
  "/wiki/Embattled": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
