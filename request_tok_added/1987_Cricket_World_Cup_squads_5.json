  "/wiki/First_class_cricket": "First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket . A first-class match is of three or more days ' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams . Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although , in practice , a team might play only one innings or none at all . First-class cricket ( which for this purpose includes all important matches played before 1895 ) , along with historical single-wicket and the modern limited-overs forms of List A and Twenty20 , is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket . The origin of the term first-class cricket is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status , effective in 1895 , following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894 . Subsequently , at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) in May 1947 , it was formally defined on a global basis . A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively . This has left historians , and especially statisticians , with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches , especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain . The solution put forward by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ( ACS ) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches . Test cricket , the highest standard of cricket , is statistically a form of first-class cricket , though the term first-class is mainly used to refer to domestic competition . A player 's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches .",

  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",

  "/wiki/Offbreak": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the fingers roll down the right side of the ball ( for a right-handed bowler ) , giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler 's perspective , this is to the left from the batsman 's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the off side . An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries . Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump . A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling , because the ball moves away from his body .",
