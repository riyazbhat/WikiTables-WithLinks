  "/wiki/British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga": "British nuclear tests at Maralinga were conducted between 1956 and 1963 at the Maralinga site , part of the Woomera Prohibited Area in South Australia about 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) north west of Adelaide . A total of seven nuclear tests were performed , with approximate yields ranging from 1 to 27 kilotonnes of TNT ( 4 to 100 TJ ) . Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site : Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year . Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests ; One Tree ( 12.9 kilotonnes of TNT ( 54 TJ ) ) and Breakaway ( 10.8 kilotonnes of TNT ( 45 TJ ) ) were detonated on towers , Marcoo ( 1.4 kilotonnes of TNT ( 5.9 TJ ) ) at ground level , and the Kite ( 2.9 kilotonnes of TNT ( 12 TJ ) ) was released by a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of 11,000 metres ( 35,000 ft ) . This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft . Operation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957 , which tested new , light-weight nuclear weapons . Three tests were conducted in this series : Tadje ( 0.93 kilotonnes of TNT ( 3.9 TJ ) , Biak 5.67 kilotonnes of TNT ( 23.7 TJ ) and Taranak 26.6 kilotonnes of TNT ( 111 TJ ) . The first two were conducted from towers , while the last was suspended from balloons . Tadje used cobalt pellets as a tracer for determining yield , resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a cobalt bomb . Between 1956 and 1963 , the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials , tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions . Kittens were trials of neutron initiators ; Rats and Tims measured how the fissile core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave ; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons . Ultimately , the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests ."
