  "/wiki/A_Doll's_House": "A Doll 's House ( Danish and Bokm\u00e5l : Et dukkehjem ; also translated as A Doll House ) is a three-act play written by Norway 's Henrik Ibsen . It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen , Denmark , on 21 December 1879 , having been published earlier that month . The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879 . The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman , who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world , despite the fact that Ibsen denies it was his intent to write a feminist play . It aroused a great sensation at the time , and caused a storm of outraged controversy that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society . In 2006 , the centennial of Ibsen 's death , A Doll 's House held the distinction of being the world 's most performed play that year . UNESCO has inscribed Ibsen 's autographed manuscripts of A Doll 's House on the Memory of the World Register in 2001 , in recognition of their historical value . The title of the play is most commonly translated as A Doll 's House , though some scholars use A Doll House . John Simon says that A Doll 's House is the British term for what [ Americans ] call a 'dollhouse ' . Egil T\u00f6rnqvist says of the alternative title : Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering , it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans .",

  "/wiki/An_Enemy_of_the_People": "An Enemy of the People ( original Norwegian title : En folkefiende ) is an 1882 play by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen . Ibsen wrote it in response to the public outcry against his previous play , Ghosts , which challenged the hypocrisy of 19th-century morality . According to Ellen Mortensen ( Ibsen Studies v.7 , 169 ) , the words scandalous , degenerate , and immoral were hurled at both Ghosts and its author because it openly discussed adultery and syphilis . Therefore , An Enemy of the People tells the story of a man who dares to speak an unpalatable truth , and is punished for it . However , Ibsen took a somewhat skeptical view of his protagonist , suggesting that he may have gone too far in his zeal to tell the truth . Ibsen wrote to his publisher : I am still uncertain as to whether I should call [ An Enemy of the People ] a comedy or a straight drama . It may [ have ] many traits of comedy , but it also is based on a serious idea .",

  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",
