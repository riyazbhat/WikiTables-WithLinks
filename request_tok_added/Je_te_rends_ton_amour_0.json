  "/wiki/Drum": "The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments . In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system , it is a membranophone . Drums consist of at least one membrane , called a drumhead or drum skin , that is stretched over a shell and struck , either directly with the player 's hands , or with a percussion mallet , to produce sound . There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum , typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead . Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound , such as the thumb roll . Drums are the world 's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments , and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years . Drums may be played individually , with the player using a single drum , and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way . Others are normally played in a set of two or more , all played by the one player , such as bongo drums and timpani . A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit .",
  "/wiki/Dance_music": "Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing . It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement . In terms of performance , the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music . While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times ( for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians ) , the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances . In the Baroque period , the major dance styles were noble court dances ( see Baroque dance ) . In the classical music era , the minuet was frequently used as a third movement , although in this context it would not accompany any dancing . The waltz also arose later in the classical era . Both remained part of the romantic music period , which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle , mazurka , ecossaise , ballade and polonaise . Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century 's Western ballroom and social dance music . During the early 20th century , ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls . Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s . In the 1930s , called the Swing era , Swing music was the popular dance music in America .",
  "/wiki/Percussion": "A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles struck , scraped or rubbed by hand or struck against another similar instrument . The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments , following the human voice . The percussion section of an orchestra most commonly contains instruments such as timpani , snare drum , bass drum , cymbals , triangle and tambourine . However , the section can also contain non-percussive instruments , such as whistles and sirens , or a blown conch shell . Percussive techniques can also be applied to the human body , as in body percussion . On the other hand , keyboard instruments , such as the celesta , are not normally part of the percussion section , but keyboard percussion instruments such as the glockenspiel and xylophone ( which do not have piano keyboards ) are included . Percussion instruments are most commonly divided into two classes : Pitched percussion instruments , which produce notes with an identifiable pitch , and unpitched percussion instruments , which produce notes or sounds without an identifiable pitch .",
  "/wiki/Nightclub": "A nightclub , music club or club , is an entertainment venue and bar that usually operates late into the night . A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars , pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music , one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth , where a DJ plays recorded music . The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs , for celebrities and their guests . Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry . Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with informal clothing or gang apparel as part of a dress code . The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night . Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres , such as house music or hip hop . Many clubs have recurring club nights on different days of the week . Most club nights focus on a particular genre or sound for branding effects .",
  "/wiki/Refrain": "A refrain ( from Vulgar Latin refringere , to repeat , and later from Old French refraindre ) is the line or lines that are repeated in music or in poetry ; the chorus of a song . Poetic fixed forms that feature refrains include the villanelle , the virelay , and the sestina . In popular music , the refrain or chorus may contrast with the verse melodically , rhythmically , and harmonically ; it may assume a higher level of dynamics and activity , often with added instrumentation . Chorus form , or strophic form , is a sectional and/or additive way of structuring a piece of music based on the repetition of one formal section or block played repeatedly .",
