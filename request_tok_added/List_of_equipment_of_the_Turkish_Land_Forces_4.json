It should not be confused with the similarly named Russian 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge , a slightly longer , rimmed cartridge . It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun in the late 1950s . The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO M16 rifle . However , the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round remain in service , especially in the case of various marksman/sniper rifles , medium machine guns/general-purpose machine guns such as the M240 , and various rifles in use by special operations forces . The cartridge is used both by infantry and on mounted and crew-served weapons mounted to vehicles , aircraft and ships . Although not identical , the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO and the commercial .308 Winchester cartridges are similar enough that they can be loaded into rifles chambered for the other round , but the Winchester .308 cartridges are typically loaded to higher pressures than 7.62\u00d751mm NATO service cartridges . Even though the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) does not consider it unsafe to fire the commercial round in weapons chambered for the NATO round , there is significant discussion about compatible chamber and muzzle pressures between the two cartridges based on powder loads and wall thicknesses on the military vs. commercial rounds .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey .

Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair .

  "/wiki/GDR": "East Germany , officially the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ; , ) , was a state that existed from 1949 to 1990 , when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War . Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front of Democratic Germany . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",
  "/wiki/German_unification": "The unification of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871 , in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in France . Princes of the German states , excluding Austria-Hungary , gathered there to proclaim William I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War . Unofficially , the de facto transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers , but in fits and starts . The self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation , beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars , which prompted the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , and the subsequent rise of German nationalism . Unification exposed tensions due to religious , linguistic , social , and cultural differences among the inhabitants of the new nation , suggesting that 1871 only represented one moment in a continuum of the larger unification processes . The Holy Roman Emperor had been often called Emperor of all the Germanies ; contemporary news accounts frequently referred to The Germanies . In the empire , higher nobility were referred to as Princes of Germany or Princes of the Germanies - for the lands once called East Francia had been organized and governed as pocket kingdoms since before the rise of Charlemagne ( 800 AD ) . In the mountainous terrain of much of the territory , isolated peoples developed cultural , educational , linguistic , and religious differences over such a lengthy time period . By the nineteenth century , transportation and communications improvements brought these regions closer together . The Holy Roman Empire , which had included more than 500 independent states , was effectively dissolved when Emperor Francis II abdicated ( 6 August 1806 ) during the War of the Third Coalition . Despite the legal , administrative , and political disruption associated with the end of the Empire , the people of the German-speaking areas of the old Empire had a common linguistic , cultural , and legal tradition further enhanced by their shared experience in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars . European liberalism offered an intellectual basis for unification by challenging dynastic and absolutist models of social and political organization ; its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition , education , and linguistic unity of peoples in a geographic region .",
