It has a 32 percent larger landmass than the North Island , and as a result is nicknamed the mainland of New Zealand , especially by South Island residents , but only 23 percent of New Zealand 's 4.8 million inhabitants live there . In the early stages of European ( P\u0101keh\u0101 ) settlement of the country , the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth due to the 1860s gold rushes . The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century , with 56 percent of the population living in the North in 1911 , and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century .",
  "/wiki/Dog_Island_Lighthouse": "The Dog Island Lighthouse on Dog Island in Foveaux Strait is New Zealand 's tallest lighthouse , and one of its oldest .

The lighthouse employed the first revolving beam in New Zealand , and the unique original light apparatus was in use for 60 years . Dog Island Lighthouse is one of the most distinct lighthouses in New Zealand , with only two others having stripes painted on them for better visibility at daytime . The lighthouse is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure , and the adjacent lighthouse keepers cottage has a Category II registration .

  "/wiki/Foveaux_Strait": "Foveaux Strait ( Te Ara a Kiwa ( the path of Kiwa ) or Te Ara a Kewa ( the path of the whale ) ( M\u0101ori ) separates Stewart Island , New Zealand 's third largest island , from the South Island . According to a Maori legend , the strait was created by Kewa the obedient whale when traditional Maori ancestor Kiwa summoned the whale to create a waterway . Three large bays , Te Waewae Bay , Oreti Beach and Toetoes Bay , sweep along the strait 's northern coast , which also hosts Bluff township and harbour . Across the strait lie the Solander Islands , Stewart Island , Dog Island and Ruapuke Island . The strait is about 130 km long ( from Ruapuke Island to Little Solander Island ) , and it widens ( from 14 km at Ruapuke Island to 50 km at Te Waewae Bay ) and deepens ( from 20 to 120 m ) from east to west . The strait lies within the continental shelf area of New Zealand , and was probably dry land during the Pleistocene epoch . Captain Cook sighted Foveaux Strait during his circumnavigation of the South Island in March 1770 , but decided to depict it as a bay instead of a strait . Cook was operating during the period of intense Anglo-French rivalry that filled the twelve years between Britain 's success in the Seven Years ' War and France 's revanche in the American Revolutionary War . The Admiralty had issued its usual instructions to hide strategically important discoveries that could become security risks , such as off-shore islands from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power . Consequently , Cook amended both his journal and chart to depict Stewart Island as a peninsula . Cook 's fake map worked and Stewart Island 's insularity was suppressed for another four decades . The strait was first charted by Owen Folger Smith , a New Yorker who had been in Sydney Harbour with Eber Bunker from whom he probably learned of the eastern seal fishery .",

  "/wiki/The_Catlins": "The Catlins ( sometimes referred to as The Catlins Coast ) comprises an area in the southeastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand . The area lies between Balclutha and Invercargill , straddling the boundary between the Otago and Southland regions . It includes the South Island 's southernmost point , Slope Point . A rugged , sparsely populated area , the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest , both of which harbour many endangered species of birds , most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin . The coast attracts numerous marine mammals , among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker 's sea lions . In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate . Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells , which are an attraction to big-wave surfers , and have also caused numerous shipwrecks . People have lived in the area since around 1350 AD . Prior to European settlement , the region was sparsely inhabited by nomadic groups of M\u0101ori , most of whom lived close to river mouths . In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers , and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s . Tourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy , which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing . The region 's population has fallen to less than half its peak in the early 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Port_Molyneux": "Port Molyneux is a tiny settlement on the coast of South Otago , New Zealand , close to the northeasternmost point of The Catlins . Now home only to farmland , it was a thriving port in the early years of New Zealand 's European settlement . The settlement , located equidistant between Kaka Point and the mouths of the Clutha River was originally located at the Clutha 's mouth . Taking its name from Molyneux Harbour , as the area was named by Captain James Cook in 1774 , In 1838 or 1839 , it became the site of a whaling station , and the first permanent European settlers , George Willsher and Thomas Russell , arrived in 1840 . The growth of settlement in the area largely started after the 1844 purchase of the Otago Block from local M\u0101ori . The mining of coal at nearby Kaitangata from the 1850s and the discovery of gold inland at Gabriel 's Gully ( leading to the Otago Gold Rush of 1861-63 ) led to an increase of the necessity for shipping . Port Molyneux was an obvious destination ( even though it was not a particularly good harbour ) as it was located close to the regional hub of Balclutha , about 15 kilometres upriver . The town continued to thrive until events in the late 1870s which between them stripped the town of its livelihood . First , a major flood in late 1878 carried silt down the Clutha and changed the river 's course . New outlets to the Pacific Ocean were created further up the coast ( at its current mouth ) , and the outlet at Port Molyneux silted up , depriving the town of downriver traffic . Less than six months later , a second disaster for the town occurred , with an explosion at Kaitangata coal mine which killed 34 miners . Compounding these events , 1879 also saw the opening of a railway link from Balclutha to the provincial capital of Dunedin , making for easier transportation of goods and passengers to the city and its port .",
