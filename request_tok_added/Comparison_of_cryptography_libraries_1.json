  "/wiki/Botan_(programming_library)": "Botan is a BSD-licensed cryptographic library written in C++ . It provides a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms , formats , and protocols , e.g . SSL and TLS . It is used in the Monotone distributed revision control program , the OpenDNSSEC system , and ISC 's Kea DHCP server among other projects . The project was originally called OpenCL , a name now used by Apple Inc. and Khronos Group for a heterogeneous system programming framework . It was renamed Botan in 2002 . In 2007 , the German Federal Office for Information Security contracted FlexSecure GmbH to add an implementation of Card Verifiable Certificates for ePassports to Botan ; the modified version of Botan was released under the name InSiTo . Starting in 2015 , the German Federal Office for Information Security funded a project , which included improving the documentation , test suite and feature set of Botan , culminating in 2017 , when it was evaluated and recommended as a library suitable for applications with increased security requirements .",
