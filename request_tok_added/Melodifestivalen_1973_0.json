  "/wiki/You're_Summer": "You 're Summer was the Swedish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 , performed in English by Claes af Geijerstam and G\u00f6ran Fristorp as Nova . The song was originally performed in Swedish as Sommaren som aldrig s\u00e4ger nej , when it won the Swedish national selection , Melodifestivalen 1973 , but was subsequently translated to English for the Eurovision as the rules requiring participant countries to sing in their own language was scrapped that year . This was first time Sweden had its entry performed in English since Absent Friend in 1965 In the song a comparison is made between a lover and the summer . The summer is when life grows in his lover and his lover never tells him no . The most intriguing line of this song is Oh your breasts are like swallows in nesting , written by the well-known poet Lars Forssell , member of the Swedish Academy . The song was performed twelfth on the night ( following Luxembourg 's Anne-Marie David with Tu te reconna\u00eetras and preceding Netherlands 's Ben Cramer with De oude muzikant ) . At the close of voting , it had received 94 points , placing 5th in a field of 17 . You 're Summer is noted as being the first song in the Eurovision Song Contest that was conducted by a woman , composer Monica Dominique ( the second song conducted by a woman was Israel 's Ey Sham in the same contest , conducted by Nurit Hirsh ) . The performing duo , called Nova in the international competition , was forced to change its name from the original Malta , since that name coincided with the name of one of the competing countries . It was succeeded as Swedish representative at the 1974 Contest by ABBA with Waterloo . The Swedish Version of the song was heard in the 2016 Eurovision Series , The Nerd Nation .",
