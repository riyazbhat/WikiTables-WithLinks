  "/wiki/400_m": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde Van Niekirk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion . Steven Gardiner is the reigning World Champion .",

  "/wiki/200_m": "The 200 metres ( also spelled 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",

Following the Games , the stadium was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium and now serves primarily as the home of West Ham United of the Premier League . Land preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007 , with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008 . The stadium held its first public event in March 2012 , serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery . Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics , the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with 66,000 seats , but with capacity for football limited to 60,000 under the terms of the lease . The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial , with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun . The stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches , two England rugby league Test matches , and the 2017 IAAF World Championships and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships ( the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year ) .

The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics .

Christian Coleman and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world champions ; Usain Bolt and Elaine Thompson are the men 's and women 's Olympic champions . On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race : ready , set , and the firing of the starter 's pistol . The runners move to the starting blocks when they hear the 'ready ' instruction . The following instruction , to adopt the 'set ' position , allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles : this will help them to start faster . A race-official then fires the starter 's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line .",

The track features an eight-lane Mondo Track , the same surface used for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games .

  "/wiki/4\u00d7400_m_relay": "The 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay or long relay is an athletics track event in which teams consist of four runners who each complete 400 metres or one lap . It is traditionally the final event of a track meet . At top class events , the first 500 metres is run in lanes . Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual 400 metres race ; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track . The slightly longer 4 \u00d7 440 yards relay was a formerly run British and American event , until metrication was completed in the 1970s . Relay race runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates . Runners have a 20 m box ( usually marked with blue lines ) in which to transfer the baton . The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines ; for the second and third transfers , runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track . This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer . Unlike the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay , runners in the 4 \u00d7 400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner , due to the fatigue of the incoming runner , and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race . Consequently , disqualification is rare . As runners have a running start , split times can not be compared to individual 400 m performances .",

While most legacy tracks will still have the older markings , the rule change still uses existing marks . Not all governing body jurisdictions have adopted the rule change .
