  "/wiki/1976_New_England_Patriots_season": "The 1976 New England Patriots season was the franchise 's 7th season in the National Football League and 17th overall . After a nine-year stretch in which they posted just one non-losing season amid eight losing years , the Patriots turned around their fortunes , going 11-3 . It marked their first winning season as an NFL team ( their last winning season came in 1966 , when the team was still in the AFL ) . The team had gone just 3-11 the previous season , and was considered a Cinderella team in 1976 . Coach Chuck Fairbanks was named NFL Coach of the Year , and cornerback Mike Haynes was named NFL Rookie of the Year . The 1976 Patriots rushed for a total of 2,957 yards ( averaging five yards per carry ) and scored 376 points , both second-best in the league . The 2,957 yards rushing were the fifth-highest total in NFL history at the time . The team 's 5.0 yards per carry was the best in the NFL and remains higher than all Super Bowl champions except the 1973 Miami Dolphins whose own run game was 5.0 yards per carry . The Patriots also led the league in takeaways at 50 ; the Patriots finished third in the league in turnover differential at plus-14 . The Patriots made only their second playoff appearance in their history and first since 1963 , but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in the first round of the playoffs . Earlier in the season , the Patriots handed the Raiders their only loss of the season with a final score of 48-17 , but a controversial roughing the passer penalty on Ray Hamilton on a Raiders drive late in the playoff game dimmed the Patriots ' hopes of defeating the Raiders again . Despite the playoff loss , the team has been considered one of the most talented in Patriots history ; in 2004 , Patriots head coach Bill Belichick , who was an assistant coach for the Detroit Lions in 1976 , called this Patriots team loaded , a who 's who team .",
