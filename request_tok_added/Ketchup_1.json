  "/wiki/Sodium": "Sodium is a chemical element with the symbol Na ( from Latin natrium ) and atomic number 11 . It is a soft , silvery-white , highly reactive metal . Sodium is an alkali metal , being in group 1 of the periodic table , because it has a single electron in its outer shell , which it readily donates , creating a positively charged ion - the Na+ cation . Its only stable isotope is 23Na . The free metal does not occur in nature , and must be prepared from compounds . Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars , sodalite , and rock salt ( NaCl ) . Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble : sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth 's minerals over eons , and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans . Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide . Among many other useful sodium compounds , sodium hydroxide ( lye ) is used in soap manufacture , and sodium chloride ( edible salt ) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans . Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants . Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume . Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration , a condition called hypernatremia .",
  "/wiki/Food_energy": "Food energy is chemical energy that animals ( including humans ) derive from food through the process of cellular respiration . Cellular respiration may either involve the chemical reaction of food molecules with molecular oxygen ( aerobic respiration ) or the process of reorganizing the food molecules without additional oxygen ( anaerobic respiration ) .",
  "/wiki/Calorie": "The calorie is a unit of energy widely used in nutrition . For historical reasons , two main definitions of calorie are in wide use . The small calorie or gram calorie ( usually denoted cal ) is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius ( or one kelvin ) . The large calorie , food calorie , or kilocalorie ( Cal or kcal ) is the amount of heat needed to cause the same increase in one kilogram of water . Thus , 1 kilocalorie ( kcal ) = 1000 calorie ( cal ) . By convention the large calorie is often written Calorie ( with a capital C ) to distinguish from the smaller unit , and this is familiar usage in technical publications . ( The convention is not followed in this article . ) In most countries , labels of industrialized food products are required to indicate the nutritional energy value in ( kilo or large ) calories per serving or per weight . Calorie relates directly to the metric system , and therefore to the SI system . It is regarded as obsolete , or deprecated , within the scientific community , since the adoption of the SI system , but still in some use . The SI unit of energy is the joule , with symbol J : one small calorie is defined as exactly 4.184 J ; one large calorie is 4184 J .",
  "/wiki/Water_(molecule)": "Water ( ) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid , which is nearly colorless apart from an inherent hint of blue . It is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent and the solvent of life . It is the most abundant substance on Earth and the only common substance to exist as a solid , liquid , and gas on Earth 's surface . It is also the third most abundant molecule in the universe . Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other and are strongly polar . This polarity allows it to dissociate ions in salts and bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids , thus dissolving them . Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties , such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form , a relatively high boiling point of 100 \u00b0C for its molar mass , and a high heat capacity . Water is amphoteric , meaning that it can exhibit properties of an acid or a base , depending on the pH of the solution that it is in ; it readily produces both and ions . Related to its amphoteric character , it undergoes self-ionization . The product of the activities , or approximately , the concentrations of and is a constant , so their respective concentrations are inversely proportional to each other .",
  "/wiki/Gram": "The gram ( alternative spelling : gramme ; SI unit symbol : g ; , from Greek ) is a metric system unit of mass . Originally defined as the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of a metre [ 1 cm ] , and at the temperature of melting ice ( later at 4 \u00b0C , the temperature of maximum density of water ) . However , in a reversal of reference and defined units , a gram is now defined as one thousandth of the SI base unit , the kilogram , or 1\u00d710 kg , which itself is now defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures , not in terms of grams , but by the amount of electricity needed to counteract its force",
  "/wiki/Protein": "Proteins are large biomolecules , or macromolecules , consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues . Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms , including catalysing metabolic reactions , DNA replication , responding to stimuli , providing structure to cells , and organisms , and transporting molecules from one location to another . Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids , which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes , and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity . A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide . A protein contains at least one long polypeptide . Short polypeptides , containing less than 20-30 residues , are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides , or sometimes oligopeptides . The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues . The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene , which is encoded in the genetic code . In general , the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids ; however , in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and - in certain archaea - pyrrolysine . Shortly after or even during synthesis , the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification , which alters the physical and chemical properties , folding , stability , activity , and ultimately , the function of the proteins . Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached , which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors . Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function , and they often associate to form stable protein complexes .",
  "/wiki/Fat": "Fats are one of the three main macronutrients , along with carbohydrates and proteins . Fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water . Examples include cholesterol , phospholipids , and triglycerides . The terms lipid , oil , and fat are often confused . Lipid is the general term , though a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride . Oil normally refers to a lipid with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature , while fat ( in the strict sense ) specifically refers to lipids that are solids at room temperature - however , fat ( in the broad sense ) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid . Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life , and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions . They are a necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs ( including humans ) and are the most energy dense , thus the most efficient form of energy storage . Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they can not be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents . There are two essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) in human nutrition : alpha-linolenic acid ( an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid ( an omega-6 fatty acid ) . Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats . Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas .",
  "/wiki/Carbohydrates": "A carbohydrate ( /k\u0251\u02d0rbo\u028a\u02c8ha\u026adre\u026at/ ) is a biomolecule consisting of carbon ( C ) , hydrogen ( H ) and oxygen ( O ) atoms , usually with a hydrogen-oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 ( as in water ) and thus with the empirical formula Cm ( H2O ) n ( where m may be different from n ) . This formula holds true for monosaccharides . Some exceptions exist ; for example , deoxyribose , a sugar component of DNA , has the empirical formula C5H10O4 . The carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon ; structurally it is more accurate to view them as aldoses and ketoses . The term is most common in biochemistry , where it is a synonym of saccharide , a group that includes sugars , starch , and cellulose . The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups : monosaccharides , disaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides . Monosaccharides and disaccharides , the smallest ( lower molecular weight ) carbohydrates , are commonly referred to as sugars . The word saccharide comes from the Greek word \u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( s\u00e1kkharon ) , meaning sugar . While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex , the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose , as in the monosaccharides fructose ( fruit sugar ) and glucose ( starch sugar ) and the disaccharides sucrose ( cane or beet sugar ) and lactose ( milk sugar ) . Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms . Polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy ( e.g . starch and glycogen ) and as structural components ( e.g .",
  "/wiki/Milligram": "The kilogram ( also kilogramme ) is the base unit of mass in the metric system , formally the International System of Units ( SI ) , having the unit symbol kg . It is a widely used measure in science , engineering , and commerce worldwide , and is often simply called a kilo in everyday speech . The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water . This was a simple definition , but difficult to use in practice . By the latest definitions of the unit , however , this relationship still has an accuracy of 30 ppm . In 1799 , the platinum Kilogramme des Archives replaced it as the standard of mass . In 1879 , a cylinder of platinum-iridium , the International Prototype of the Kilogram ( IPK ) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system , and remained so until 20 May 2019 . The kilogram was the last of the SI units to be defined by a physical artefact . The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second and the metre , based on fixed fundamental constants of nature , as approved by the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) on 16 November 2018 . The replacement of the International Prototype Kilogram as primary standard was motivated by evidence accumulated over a long period of time that the mass of the IPK and its replicas had been changing ; the IPK had diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century . This led to several competing efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to warrant replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants . Physical standard masses such as the IPK and its replicas still serve as secondary standards .",
  "/wiki/Vitamin_C": "Vitamin C , also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate , is a vitamin found in various foods and sold as a dietary supplement . It is used to prevent and treat scurvy . Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters . It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function . It also functions as an antioxidant . Current [ when ? ] evidence does not support its use for the prevention of the common cold . There is , however , some evidence that regular use may shorten the length of colds . It is unclear whether supplementation affects the risk of cancer , cardiovascular disease , or dementia . It may be taken by mouth or by injection . Vitamin C is generally well tolerated . Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort , headache , trouble sleeping , and flushing of the skin .",
  "/wiki/Lycopene": "Lycopene ( from the neo-Latin Lycopersicum , the tomato species ) is a bright red carotenoid hydrocarbon found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables , such as red carrots , watermelons , gac melons , and papayas , but it is not present in strawberries or cherries . Although lycopene is chemically a carotene , it has no vitamin A activity . Foods that are not red may also contain lycopene , such as asparagus and parsley . In plants , algae , and other photosynthetic organisms , lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids , including beta-carotene , which is responsible for yellow , orange , or red pigmentation , photosynthesis , and photoprotection . Like all carotenoids , lycopene is a tetraterpene . It is insoluble in water . Eleven conjugated double bonds give lycopene its deep red color . Owing to the strong color , lycopene is useful as a food coloring ( registered as E160d ) and is approved for use in the USA , Australia and New Zealand ( registered as 160d ) and the European Union ."
