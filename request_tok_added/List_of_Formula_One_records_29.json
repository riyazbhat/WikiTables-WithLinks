In doing so , Vettel became the youngest World Drivers ' Champion in the sport 's sixty-year history . Vettel 's victory in the championship came after a dramatic season finale at Abu Dhabi where three other drivers could also have won the championship - Vettel 's Red Bull Racing teammate Mark Webber , Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso and McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton . This was Bridgestone 's final season as the sole tyre supplier in Formula One as the company announced that it would not renew its contract at the end of the season . After several months of deliberation , Pirelli was chosen as the tyre supplier for the 2011 season at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Geneva , in June 2010 . The points system was changed , with 25 points being awarded for first place , 18 for second , 15 for third , then 12 , 10 , 8 , 6 , 4 , 2 and 1 for fourth to tenth . The technical and sporting regulations applicable for the season were the subject of much debate . Before the start of the season , 2009 Drivers ' Champion Jenson Button joined McLaren , while the 2009 Constructors ' Champion , Brawn GP , was bought by German motor vehicle manufacturer Mercedes-Benz and was renamed as Mercedes GP .

The early season was tumultuous , with seven different drivers winning the first seven races of the championship ; a record for the series . It was not until the European Grand Prix in June that a driver , Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso , won his second race of the year , and with it , emerged as a championship contender . Alonso maintained his hold on the championship lead for the next seven races , taking his third win in Germany and finishing on the podium in the United Kingdom , Italy and Singapore . However , costly first-lap retirements in Belgium and Japan allowed his rivals to catch up , and defending World Champion Sebastian Vettel - like Alonso , a two-time title winner - took the lead in the sixteenth race of the season . Vettel , too , encountered difficulties throughout the season ; contact with a backmarker left him to finish outside the points in Malaysia , while alternator failures at the European and Italian Grands Prix cost him valuable points and exclusion from qualifying in Abu Dhabi led him to start from the pit lane . Vettel entered the final race of the season with a thirteen-point lead over Alonso . Alonso needed a podium finish to stand any chance of becoming World Drivers ' Champion , but in a race of attrition that finished under the safety car , Vettel finished in sixth place , scoring enough points to win his third consecutive championship , becoming just the third driver in the sport 's sixty-three-year history to do so .",
