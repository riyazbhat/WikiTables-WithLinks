Lim 's 9-darter remained the only 9-dart game to have been achieved in either version of the world championships , until Raymond van Barneveld hit one against Jelle Klaasen in the quarter-final of the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship . To date , it remains the only 9-dart finish ever achieved at the BDO World Darts Championship . Lim represented three countries at darts . Singapore was not affiliated with the sport 's governing body , the World Darts Federation ( WDF ) , so Lim played briefly for Papua New Guinea , but settled in California and represented the United States in international competition , before also playing for his native country when they became a WDF playing nation . Lim has also represented Singapore at the PDC World Cup of Darts , and in the 2017 PDC World Cup of Darts , he and his teammate Harith Lim , reached the quarter-finals , defeating the top seeds Scotland ( Gary Anderson and Peter Wright ) in the first round .",
