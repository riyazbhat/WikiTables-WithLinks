  "/wiki/International_Football_Cup": "The UEFA Intertoto Cup ( abbreviated as UI Cup ) , originally called the International Football Cup , was a summer football competition for European clubs that had not qualified for one of the major UEFA competitions , the Champions League , the UEFA Cup and until 1999 , the Cup Winners ' Cup . The competition was discontinued after the 2008 tournament . Teams who originally would have entered the Intertoto Cup now directly enter the qualifying stages of the UEFA Europa League from this point . The tournament was founded in 1961-62 , but was only taken over by UEFA in 1995 . Initially , the tournament ended with a single champion , who received the Intertoto Cup . Starting in 1967 , the tournament ended with a number of group winners ( 7 to 14 winners , see below ) , who received cash prizes . When UEFA took on the tournament , it became a qualifier for the UEFA Cup , with 2 to 11 Intertoto winners ( see below ) advancing to the Second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup . Any club who wished to participate had to apply for entry , with the highest placed clubs ( by league position in their domestic league ) at the end of the season entering the competition . The club did not have to be ranked directly below the clubs which had qualified for another UEFA competition ; if the club which was in that position did not apply , they would not be eligible to compete , with the place instead going to the club which did apply . The cup billed itself as providing both an opportunity for clubs who otherwise would not get the chance to enter the UEFA Cup and as an opportunity for sports lotteries ( or pools ) to continue during the summer . This reflects its background , which was as a tournament solely for football pools . In 1995 , the tournament came under official UEFA sanctioning and UEFA Cup qualification places were granted .",

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line .

They collected most of their honours in the 1940s and in the 1980s . KV Mechelen was founded in 1904 and , in 1921-22 , promoted to the first division . After two successive relegation and promotion , they were back for good between 1928-29 and 1955-56 . In the 1960s and 1970s , the club had several promotions and relegations between the first and second division . From 1983-84 to 1996-97 , they had a successful first division spell , with a title and several second- and third-place finishes . During that period , they also won a European Cup Winners ' Cup and they reached the same competition semi-finals as well as the European Cup quarter-finals . KV Mechelen declined in the late 1990s though they had two more spells at the highest level from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 and in 2002-03 . At the end of that season , the club did not receive their Belgian professional football license . They were therefore relegated to the third division with a nine-point penalty .",

The defending champion was Internazionale , which was eliminated in the first round by Boavista .",

  "/wiki/Away_goals_rule": "The away goals rule is a method of breaking ties in association football and other sports when teams play each other twice , once at each team 's home ground . By the away goals rule , the team that has scored more goals away from home wins , if the total goals scored by each team are otherwise equal . This is sometimes expressed by saying that away goals count double in the event of a tie . The away goals rule is most often invoked in two-leg fixtures , where the initial result is determined by the aggregate score - i.e . the scores of both games are added together . In many competitions , the away goals rule is the first tie-breaker in such cases , with a penalty shootout as the second tie-breaker if each team has scored the same number of away goals . Rules vary as to whether the away goals rule applies only to the end of normal time of the second leg , or applies in extra time as well . It was first introduced by UEFA in the 1965-66 European Cup Winners ' Cup .",

Ajax won the competition without losing a game , either in the group or the knock-out stage in winning the title for the first time since 1973 . Compared to the previous edition of the European Cup , radical changes were made to the format of the tournament , due to a recently expired contract that bound UEFA to the EBU for the transmission of the final , and this gave occasion for a general review of the format , which attracted the interest of new and financially well-off private television companies . This year included four groups of four teams each in the group stage , up from two groups of four teams each in 1993-94 . It was also the first year in which eight teams advanced to the knock-out stage and the first of three years in which smaller clubs entered the UEFA Cup instead of the Champions League . It was also the first time that this competition was known as UEFA Champions League from the first to the last match of the competition , the two previous seasons , the UEFA Champions League involved the round ( s ) between the round of 16 and the final of the European Champions Cup .
