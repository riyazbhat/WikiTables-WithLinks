  "/wiki/Led_Zeppelin": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 . The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant , guitarist Jimmy Page , bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . With their heavy , guitar-driven sound , they are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , although their style drew from a variety of influences , including blues and folk music . After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group were initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums released over ten years , from Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) to In Through the Out Door ( 1979 ) . Their untitled fourth studio album , commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) , and featuring the song Stairway to Heaven , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and helped to secure the group 's popularity . Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones 's keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the former members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions .

The album is notable for featuring Stairway to Heaven , which has been described as the band 's signature song . The informal setting at Headley Grange inspired the band , and allowed them to try different arrangements of material and create songs in a variety of styles .

  "/wiki/21_(Adele_album)": "21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele . It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records . The album was named after the age of the singer during its production . 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19 , but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008-09 North American tour An Evening with Adele . Composed in the aftermath of the singer 's separation from her then partner , the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak , self-examination , and forgiveness . Adele began writing 21 in April 2009 , when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record . Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut , she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up . However , studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration . She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship , channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs . Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers , including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin , Paul Epworth , Ryan Tedder , Jim Abbiss , and Dan Wilson . Praised by critics for its understated production , vintage aesthetic , and Adele 's vocal performance , 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings . The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world 's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012 ."
