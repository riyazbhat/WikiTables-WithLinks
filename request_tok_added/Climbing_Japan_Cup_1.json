It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honsh\u016b , on the north shore of Osaka Bay and about 30 km ( 19 mi ) west of Osaka . With a population around 1.5 million , the city is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto . The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki , which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201 . For most of its history , the area was never a single political entity , even during the Tokugawa period , when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate . Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889 . Its name comes from Kanbe ( \u795e\u6238 , an archaic title for supporters of the city 's Ikuta Shrine ) . Kobe became one of Japan 's designated cities in 1956 . Kobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city . While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe 's prominence as a port city , it remains Japan 's fourth-busiest container port . Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , and Kobe Steel , as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city , such as Eli Lilly and Company , Procter & Gamble , Boehringer Ingelheim , and Nestl\u00e9 . The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef , as well as the site of one of Japan 's most famous hot spring resorts , Arima Onsen .",
