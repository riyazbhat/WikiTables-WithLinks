  "/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army_Navy": "The People 's Liberation Army Navy ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u89e3\u653e\u519b\u6d77\u519b ) , also known as the PLA Navy or PLAN , is the naval warfare branch of the People 's Liberation Army , which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of China and , by default , the national armed forces of the People 's Republic of China . The PLAN can trace its lineage to naval units fighting during the Chinese Civil War and was established in September 1950 . Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , the Soviet Union provided assistance to the PLAN in the form of naval advisers and export of equipment and technology . Until the late 1980s , the PLAN was largely a riverine and littoral force ( brown-water navy ) . However , by the 1990s , following the fall of the Soviet Union and a shift towards a more forward-oriented foreign and security policy , the leaders of the Chinese military were freed from worrying over land border disputes , and instead turned their attention towards the seas . This led to the development of the People 's Liberation Army Navy into a green-water navy by 2009 . Before the 1990s the PLAN had traditionally played a subordinate role to the People 's Liberation Army Ground Force . In 2008 , General Qian Lihua confirmed that China plans to operate a small fleet of aircraft carriers in the near future , but for the purpose of regional defence as opposed to global reach . As of 2013 PLA officials have also outlined plans to operate in the first and second island chains . Chinese strategists term the development of the PLAN from a green-water navy into a regional blue-water defensive and offensive navy . The People 's Liberation Army Navy is composed of five branches ; the Submarine Force , the Surface Force , the Coastal Defense Force , the Marine Corps and the Naval Air Force . With a personnel strength of 255,000 servicemen and women , including 10,000 marines and 26,000 naval air force personnel , it is the second largest navy in the world in terms of tonnage , only behind the United States Navy , and has the largest number of major combatants of any navy .",
