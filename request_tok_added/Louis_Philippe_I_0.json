  "/wiki/Leopold_I_of_Belgium": "Leopold I ( French : L\u00e9opold ; [ a ] 16 December 1790 - 10 December 1865 ) was a German prince who became the first King of the Belgians following the country 's independence in 1830 . He reigned between July 1831 and December 1865 . Born into the ruling family of the small German duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars . After Napoleon 's defeat , Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales , who was second in line to the British throne and the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent ( the future King George IV ) . Charlotte died after only a year of marriage , but Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain . After the Greek War of Independence ( 1821-32 ) , Leopold was offered the crown of Greece but turned it down , believing it to be too precarious . Instead , Leopold accepted the kingship of the newly established Kingdom of Belgium in 1831 . The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe , and because as the British-backed candidate , he was not affiliated with other powers , such as France , which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna . Leopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831 , an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day . His reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and , later , by internal political division between liberals and Catholics . As a Protestant , Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation , playing an important role in encouraging the creation of Belgium 's first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation . As a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution , Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch 's powers during his reign .",

  "/wiki/Francis_I_of_Austria": "Francis II ( ; 12 February 1768 - 2 March 1835 ) was the last Holy Roman Emperor , ruling from 1792 until 6 August 1806 , when he dissolved the Holy Roman Empire after the decisive defeat at the hands of the First French Empire led by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz . In 1804 , he had founded the Austrian Empire and became Francis I , the first Emperor of Austria , ruling from 1804 to 1835 , so later he was named the first Doppelkaiser ( double emperor ) in history . For the two years between 1804 and 1806 , Francis used the title and style by the Grace of God elected Roman Emperor , ever Augustus , hereditary Emperor of Austria and he was called the Emperor of both the Holy Roman Empire and Austria . He was also Apostolic King of Hungary , Croatia and Bohemia as Francis I . He also served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815 . Francis II continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the Napoleonic Wars , and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz . The proxy marriage of the state of his daughter Marie Louise of Austria to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his severest personal defeat . After the abdication of Napoleon following the War of the Sixth Coalition , Austria participated as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna , which was largely dominated by Francis 's chancellor Klemens Wenzel , Prince von Metternich culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis 's ancient dominions ( except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved ) . Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe , which largely resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies , Francis became viewed as a reactionary later in his reign .
