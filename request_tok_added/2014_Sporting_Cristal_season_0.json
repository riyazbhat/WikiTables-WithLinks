  "/wiki/Midfielder_(association_football)": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

  "/wiki/Tigre_Club": "The Tigre Club stands on the banks of the Luj\u00e1n River , in Paseo Victorica , Tigre , near Buenos Aires , Argentina . The club , built next to the Tigre Hotel ( demolished in 1940 ) , was financed by Ernesto Tornquist and was designed by the architects Pablo Pater , Luis Dubois and the engineer Emilio Mitre ( son of the former President of Argentina , Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre ) ; it was opened on 13 January 1912 . Like the hotel nearby opened in 1890 , the Tigre Club soon became an important meeting place for the rich and famous . The elegant and luxurious building has two floors with mezzanines with large windows on almost all sides . The main saloon on the first floor has frescoes by the Spanish artist Julio Vila y Prades ( 1875-1930 ) , the staircases are of marble and there are Venetian mirrors and French chandeliers . A casino operated there until 1933 , when it was transferred to Mar del Plata after a law was passed prohibiting the existence of a casino so close to Buenos Aires . The closing of the casino and the international crisis brought about a considerable loss of public . After the demolition of the Tigre Hotel in 1940 , the club continued to function as a restaurant with live shows but it never recovered its former glory . In 1979 the Tigre Club was declared a National Historic Monument . After extensive restoration it now houses the Tigre Municipal Museum of Fine Art ( Museo de Arte Tigre ) , opened in 2006 . Confusion still sometimes arises between the Tigre Club and the demolished Tigre Hotel .",

Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4-2-3-1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none .",
