  "/wiki/New_York_Yanks": "The New York Yanks were an American football team that played in the National Football League under that name in the 1950 and 1951 seasons . The team began as the Boston Yanks , owned by Kate Smith 's manager , Ted Collins . He wanted a team in New York City , but had to be content with one in Boston after the New York Giants refused to let his new team share the New York area . In 1949 , however , Collins , suspecting that the All-America Football Conference was on its last legs , got permission to move to New York . Rather than a formal relocation , however , Collins asked the NFL to fold his Boston franchise and grant him a new one for New York - most likely as a tax write-off . This new team played as the New York Bulldogs and shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants during the 1949 season . In 1950 , Collins changed his franchise 's name to the New York Yanks and moved to Yankee Stadium . For all intents and purposes , however , this was an almost entirely new team . Only four players from the 1949 Bulldogs ( Joe Domnanovich , Joe Golding , John Nolan and John Rauch ) played for the Yanks in 1950 . In contrast , there were 18 players from the New York Yankees of the AAFC ( Bruce Alford , George Brown , Brad Ecklund , Don Garza , Sherman Howard , Duke Iverson , Harvey Johnson , Bob Kennedy , Lou Kusseow , Pete Layden , Paul Mitchell , Barney Poole , Martin Ruby , Jack Russell , Ed Sharkey , Joe Signaigo , John Wozniak and Buddy Young ) .

In September 2018 , Mack was traded to the Bears for two first-round draft picks and signed a six-year , $ 141 million extension , becoming the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history .

  "/wiki/2014_NFL_Draft": "The 2014 NFL draft was the 79th annual meeting of National Football League ( NFL ) franchises to select newly eligible football players to the league . The draft , officially the Player Selection Meeting , was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City , New York , on May 8th through May 10th , 2014 . One of the most anticipated drafts in recent years kicked off on May 8 , 2014 at 8 pm EDT . The draft was moved from its traditional time frame in late April due to a scheduling conflict at Radio City Music Hall . There was early discussion and rumors leading up to the draft on the future of staying at the current location in New York City , where it had been held since 1965 . Given the increased interest the draft had garnered over the past decade , there was belief that the event may have outgrown Radio City Music Hall , which had been the venue for the past nine drafts . The possibility of extending the draft to four days was also being discussed throughout the months leading up to the draft . The NFL decided in that summer that the 2015 NFL Draft will take place at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago , Illinois . The Houston Texans opened the draft by selecting defensive end Jadeveon Clowney from the University of South Carolina . The last time a defensive player was taken with the first overall selection was in 2006 , when the Texans selected Mario Williams . The Texans also closed the draft with the selection of safety Lonnie Ballentine of the University of Memphis as Mr . Irrelevant , which is the title given to the final player selected .",

  "/wiki/2015_NFL_Draft": "The 2015 NFL Draft was the 80th annual meeting of National Football League ( NFL ) franchises to select newly eligible football players . It took place in Chicago at the Auditorium Theatre and in Grant Park , from April 30 to May 2 . The previous fifty NFL drafts ( since 1965 ) had been held in New York City . The 2015 NFL draft was the first to feature an outdoor component , where fans would be able to see the Commissioner on the Auditorium Theatre stage from across the street in the park ; this area was called Draft Town . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers held the right to select first because they had the league 's worst record in the previous season . The Arizona Cardinals made the final pick in the draft , commonly called Mr . Irrelevant . One of the major storylines approaching the NFL draft was the competition between the previous two Heisman Trophy winners , Jameis Winston winning the award in 2013 and Marcus Mariota in 2014 . Both were considered excellent prospects and had the potential to become the first overall draft selection . Winston was considered to be a more polished pocket passer and pro-style quarterback , but had several off-the-field issues while playing at Florida State , ranging from a sexual assault allegation to shoplifting incidents . Mariota was considered a better athlete , the fastest quarterback in the draft , and had a better off-the-field reputation . However , Mariota ran a spread offense at Oregon which typically had not transitioned well from college to the NFL .",

The Seahawks are the only NFL franchise based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America , and thus attract support from a wide geographical area , including some parts of Oregon , Montana , Idaho , and Alaska , as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia , Alberta and Saskatchewan . Steve Largent , Cortez Kennedy , Walter Jones , and Kenny Easley have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks .

  "/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals": "The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football franchise based in Cincinnati , Ohio . The Bengals compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Their home stadium is Paul Brown Stadium , located in downtown Cincinnati . Their divisional opponents are the Baltimore Ravens , Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season . The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981 and 1988 , but lost Super Bowls XVI and XXIII to the San Francisco 49ers ."
