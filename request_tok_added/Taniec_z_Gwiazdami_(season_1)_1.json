  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

  "/wiki/Freestyle_dance": "Dance improvisation is the process of spontaneously creating movement . Development of movement material is facilitated through a variety of creative explorations including body mapping through levels , shape and dynamics schema . Improvisation is a free , seemingly unstructured , less technically strict and impulsive form that draws inspiration from everyday dance practices and influences . It is a movement technique that is capable of evoking dramatic and thought-provoking content just as well as more codified western dance techniques such as ballet and non-western movement forms . Dance improvisation is not only about creating new movement but is also defined as freeing the body from habitual movement patterns ( see Postmodern dance and Judson Dance Theater ) . Dancer and singer Michael Jackson combined improvisation in both of those definitions , insisting that he had interest in performing a dance to Billie Jean only if he could do it a new way each time . A lot of improvisation is focused on finding a deeper way of comprehending otherwise concealed thoughts or feelings of an individual . Through the emphasis of instinctual , unpredictable , free movement that improvisation is centered upon the mover is able to explore authentic feelings and inspirations ."
