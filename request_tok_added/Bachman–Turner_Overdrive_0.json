  "/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100": "The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs , published weekly by Billboard magazine . Chart rankings are based on sales ( physical and digital ) , radio play , and online streaming in the United States . The weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991 , but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015 . This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data . Radio airplay , which , unlike sales figures and streaming , is readily available on a real-time basis , is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle ( previously Wednesday to Tuesday ) . A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesdays . The first number one song of the Billboard Hot 100 was Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson , on August 4 , 1958 . As of the issue for the week ending on January 4 , 2020 , the Billboard Hot 100 has had 1,095 different number one entries . The chart 's current number-one song is All I Want for Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey .",
  "/wiki/RPM_(magazine)": "RPM ( and later ) was a Canadian music industry publication that featured song and album charts for Canada . The publication was founded by Walt Grealis in February 1964 , supported through its existence by record label owner Stan Klees . RPM ceased publication in November 2000 . RPM stood for Records , Promotion , Music . The magazine was reported to have variations in its title over the years such as RPM Weekly and RPM Magazine . RPM maintained several format charts , including Top Singles ( all genres ) , Adult Contemporary , Dance , Urban , Rock/Alternative and Country Tracks ( a.k.a . Top Country Tracks ) for country music . On 21 March 1966 , RPM expanded its Top Singles chart from 40 positions to 100 . On December 6 , 1980 the main chart became a Top 50 chart and remained this way until August 4 , 1984 whereupon it returned to being a Top 100 Singles chart . For the first several weeks of its existence , the magazine did not compile a national chart , but simply printed the current airplay lists of several major market Top 40 stations . A national chart was introduced beginning with the June 22 , 1964 issue , with its first-ever national # 1 single being Chapel of Love by The Dixie Cups . Prior to the introduction of RPM 's national chart , the CHUM Chart from Toronto radio station CHUM was considered the de facto national chart .",

Although this album did not produce a true hit single ( Blue Collar only managed to reach # 68 on the U.S . Billboard charts ) , it was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1974 , largely pulled up by strong sales of BTO 's two subsequent albums ( Bachman-Turner Overdrive II and Not Fragile ) . In later years , this first album was often referred to as BTO 1 to distinguish it from the band 's follow-up second album .",

The album features the well-known single Takin ' Care of Business . Though it never cracked the Top 10 on the U.S. singles charts ( reaching # 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1974 ) , it became one of the band 's most enduring hits and stayed on the Billboard chart for 20 weeks .

Some reviews stated the song was directed at Bachman 's former Guess Who bandmate , Burton Cummings . According to liner notes supplied with the BTO compilation CD The Anthology , Mercury Records had wanted a quick follow-up to the highly successful Not Fragile album . Thus , Four-Wheel Drive was recorded in six days , much of it containing material that was left over from the Not Fragile sessions .",
  "/wiki/Head_On_(Bachman\u2013Turner_Overdrive_album)": "Head On is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive , released in December 1975 . On the original vinyl release , the album came with a 24x24 inch poster featuring all the members in the band at that time . It was re-released in 2003 on Repertoire Records in conjunction with Mercury Records .

Away from Home was also released as a single in the UK only , with Down To The Line on the B-side .",
  "/wiki/Freeways_(album)": "Freeways is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive , released in 1977 . It was the last album that Randy Bachman would be a part of with BTO until seven years later when a reunion Bachman-Turner Overdrive studio album was made and released in 1984 . This is also the last studio album to be made with the band 's classic and most successful Not Fragile line up . It was the first BTO studio album to become a commercial failure , featuring the first BTO single that did not chart ( My Wheels Wo n't Turn ) . Randy Bachman wrote every song besides Life Still Goes On , while only two of the album 's eight songs featured Fred Turner as the lead vocalist . Many of BTO 's core fans did not like the album , as it was not the heavy , guitar driven rock n ' roll that BTO was known for . Turner was reportedly so unhappy with this album that he would n't allow a straight-on picture of himself to be used on the cover , saying he felt like a side man . He went so far as to state that Freeways should have been a Randy Bachman solo album . Years later , Randy would agree that the Freeways album was rushed to the studio , and that the band should have taken some down time , allowing them to develop more song ideas . He did however , mention Down Down , Shotgun Rider , and My Wheels Wo n't Turn as songs that were worthy of inclusion on any BTO album , singling out the Duane Allman-esque guitar solo on My Wheels Wo n't Turn as one of Blair Thornton 's finest moments on record . This album was one of the last albums to reach the charts by any formation of BTO . The 8-track tape version of this album has the distinction of being one of the few 8-tracks that is arranged exactly like the album , with no song breaks .",
  "/wiki/Street_Action": "Street Action is the seventh studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive ( BTO ) , released in 1978 . It was the first BTO album released after the 1977 departure of co-founder Randy Bachman , the band having replaced him with bassist/vocalist Jim Clench . Fred Turner , who played bass on all previous BTO releases , moved to rhythm guitar , and he shared lead vocal duties with Clench . Street Action had a distinctively heavier sound than the previous two BTO studio albums ( Head On and Freeways ) . This was pointed out in a Mark After Dark interview with BTO drummer Robbie Bachman : This album was reissued in 2016 as part of the Bachman-Turner Overdrive Classic Albums Box Set .",
  "/wiki/Rock_n'_Roll_Nights": "Rock n ' Roll Nights is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band BTO , released in 1979 . This record was one of three BTO albums that did not feature co-founder Randy Bachman . Rock n ' Roll Nights is also one of the two albums from this band to feature Jim Clench , formerly of April Wine . This LP generated worldwide sales of only about 350,000 copies , though a single from the album called Heartaches managed to reach # 60 on the U.S. charts and cracked the Top 40 in Canada . Rock n ' Roll Nights is a rare find on CD , as it was released only for a short time on that format in 1990 . The band used multiple outside songwriters on Rock n ' Roll Nights , including Jim Vallance of Prism and Bryan Adams ( who penned the song , Wastin ' Time ) . C.F . Turner and Jim Clench would later appear as session musicians for Adams ' debut album in 1980 , where Adams recorded his own version of Wastin ' Time . The band played two songs - Heartaches , the last BTO single to chart , and Jamaica - live on American Bandstand in February 1979 to support the Rock n ' Roll Nights album release . Producer Vallance played the piano for the TV taping of Heartaches . During an interview segment on the show , Dick Clark mentions to the band that he is concerned about the increasing and dominating popularity of disco music at the time . Many consider disco and the decline of guitar-based hard rock in the late 1970s to be among the reasons that both Street Action and Rock n ' Roll Nights sold so poorly .",

This is the only BTO studio album done without Robbie Bachman on drums . He disputed some of the agreements for the album and reunion , including the choice of Tim Bachman instead of Blair Thornton , and refused to join . Garry Peterson , who was Randy Bachman 's bandmate in The Guess Who , plays drums on the album . This album is also the last studio album Randy Bachman has done to date with BTO . The album was originally released on Compleat Records , but it is currently in print under the Sun Record label . The leadoff song , For the Weekend , was released as a single and also included an accompanying music video ."
