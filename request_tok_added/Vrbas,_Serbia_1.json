  "/wiki/Rusyns": "Rusyns ( Rusyn : \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u044b / Rusyn\u0177 ) , sometimes referred to as Rusnaks ( Rusyn : \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043d\u0430\u043a\u044b / Rusnak\u0177 ) , also known as Carpatho-Ruthenians or Carpatho-Russians ( Rusyn : \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e-\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438 / Karpato-Rusyny ) , are an East Slavic people who speak the Rusyn language . They descend from an East Slavic population which inhabited the northern regions of the Eastern Carpathians from the Early Middle Ages . Together with other East Slavs from neighboring regions , they were often labeled [ by whom ? ] by the common exonym Ruthenians , or by the regionally more specific designation Carpathian Ruthenians , with sub-group designations such as Dolinyans , Boykos , Hutsuls and Lemkos . Unlike their neighbors to the east , who adopted the use of the ethnonym Ukrainians in the early 20th century , Rusyns kept and preserved their original name . As residents of northeastern regions of the Carpathian Mountains , Rusyns are closely connected to , and also sometimes associated with , other Slavic communities in the region , like the Slovak highlander community of Gorals ( literally , Highlanders ) . The main regional designations for Rusyns are : Carpatho-Rusyns , Carpatho-Ruthenians and Carpatho-Russians , with the Carpatho- prefix referring to Carpathian Ruthenia ( Rusynia ) , a historical cross-border region encompassing south-western parts of modern Ukraine , north-eastern regions of Slovakia , and south-eastern parts of Poland . Of the estimated 1.2-1.6 million people of Rusyn origins , only around 90,000 individuals have been officially identified as such in recent national censuses . That is because many census-taking authorities regard them as a sub-group of Ukrainian people , but some countries officially recognize them as an ethnic minority .",

  "/wiki/Germans": "Germans ( German : Deutsche ) are a Germanic ethnic group native to Central Europe , who share a common German ancestry , culture and history . German is the shared mother tongue of a substantial majority of ethnic Germans . The English term Germans has historically referred to the German-speaking population of the Holy Roman Empire since the Late Middle Ages . [ note 3 ] Ever since the outbreak of the Protestant Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire , German society has been characterized by a Catholic-Protestant divide . Of approximately 100 million native speakers of German in the world , roughly 80 million consider themselves Germans . [ citation needed ] There are an additional 80 million people of German ancestry mainly in the United States , Brazil ( mainly in the South Region of the country ) , Argentina , Canada , South Africa , the post-Soviet states ( mainly in Russia and Kazakhstan ) , and France , each accounting for at least 1 million .
