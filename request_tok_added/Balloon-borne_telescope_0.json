  "/wiki/Stratoscope": "The Stratoscopes were two balloon-borne astronomical telescopes which flew from the 1950s to the 1970s and observed in the optical and infrared regions of the spectrum . Both were controlled remotely from the ground . Stratoscope I possessed a 12-inch ( 30.48 cm ) mirror and was first flown in 1957 . It was conceived by Martin Schwarzschild and built by the Perkin Elmer Corporation . A small secondary mirror focussed the image from the primary into a 35 mm movie camera , which captured the images on film . Schwarzschild used the telescope to study the turbulence and granulation in the Sun 's photosphere . Stratoscope II , a 36-inch ( 91.4 cm ) reflecting telescope , flew from 1963 to 1971 . The gondola it was mounted on weighed 3.5 tons . It studied planetary atmospheres , the atmospheres of red giant stars , and galaxies . On early flights of Stratoscope II , photographic film was used , but this was soon replaced by television detectors .

  "/wiki/Polyethylene": "Polyethylene or polythene ( abbreviated PE ; IUPAC name polyethene or poly ( methylene ) ) is the most common plastic . As of 2017 [ update ] , over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene resins are produced annually , accounting for 34% of the total plastics market . Its primary use is in packaging ( plastic bags , plastic films , geomembranes , containers including bottles , etc. ) . Many kinds of polyethylene are known , with most having the chemical formula ( C2H4 ) n. PE is usually a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene with various values of n. Polyethylene is a thermoplastic ; however , it can become a thermoset plastic when modified ( such as cross-linked polyethylene ) .",
  "/wiki/Zodiacal_light": "Zodiacal light ( also called false dawn when seen before sunrise ) is a faint , diffuse , and roughly triangular white glow that is visible in the night sky and appears to extend from the Sun 's direction and along the zodiac , straddling the ecliptic . Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust causes this phenomenon . Zodiacal light is best seen during twilight after sunset in spring and before sunrise in autumn , when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon . However , the glow is so faint that moonlight and/or light pollution outshine it , rendering it invisible . The brightness of zodiacal light decreases with distance from the Sun . In naturally dark night skies , the glow is visible as a band along the entire zodiac , completely straddling the ecliptic . In fact , zodiacal light spans the entire sky and largely contributes to the total natural light in a clear and moonless night sky . Another phenomenon - a faint but slightly brighter oval glow - directly opposite of the Sun is the gegenschein , which is caused by backscattered sunlight . The interplanetary dust in the Solar System collectively forms a thick , pancake-shaped cloud called the zodiacal cloud , which straddles the ecliptic plane . The particle sizes range between 10 and 300 micrometres , most with a mass around 150 micrograms . The Pioneer 10 spacecraft observations in the 1970s linked zodiacal light with the interplanetary dust cloud in the Solar System .",
  "/wiki/Balloons_for_X-ray_astronomy": "High-altitude balloons are manned or unmanned balloons , usually filled with helium or hydrogen , or in some cases methane , that are released into the stratosphere , generally attaining between above sea level . In 2002 , a balloon named BU60-1 reached a record altitude of . The most common type of high-altitude balloons are weather balloons . Other purposes include use as a platform for experiments in the upper atmosphere . Modern balloons generally contain electronic equipment such as radio transmitters , cameras , or satellite navigation systems , such as GPS receivers . These balloons are launched into what is termed near space , defined as the area of Earth 's atmosphere between the Armstrong limit ( above sea level ) , where pressure falls to the point that a human being could not survive without a pressurised suit , and the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line ( above sea level ) , where astrodynamics must take over from aerodynamics in order to maintain flight . Due to the low cost of GPS and communications equipment , high-altitude ballooning is a popular hobby , with organizations such as UKHAS assisting the development of payloads .",
  "/wiki/BOOMERanG_experiment": "In astronomy and observational cosmology , The BOOMERanG experiment ( Balloon Observations Of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation ANd Geophysics ) was an experiment which measured the cosmic microwave background radiation of a part of the sky during three sub-orbital ( high-altitude ) balloon flights . It was the first experiment to make large , high-fidelity images of the CMB temperature anisotropies , and is best known for the discovery in 2000 that the geometry of the universe is close to flat , with similar results from the competing MAXIMA experiment . By using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high , it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum . This allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe , though only a tiny part of the sky could be scanned . The first was a test flight over North America in 1997 . In the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic . It was carried by the Polar vortex winds in a circle around the South Pole , returning after two weeks . From this phenomenon the telescope took its name . The BOOMERanG team was led by Andrew E. Lange of Caltech and Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome La Sapienza .",

The Antarctic comprises the continent of Antarctica , the Kerguelen Plateau and other island territories located on the Antarctic Plate or south of the Antarctic Convergence . The Antarctic region includes the ice shelves , waters , and all the island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence , a zone approximately 32 to 48 km ( 20 to 30 mi ) wide varying in latitude seasonally . The region covers some 20 percent of the Southern Hemisphere , of which 5.5 percent ( 14 million km2 ) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself . All of the land and ice shelves south of 60\u00b0S latitude are administered under the Antarctic Treaty System . Biogeographically , the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth 's land surface .",
  "/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation": "The cosmic microwave background ( CMB , CMBR ) , in Big Bang cosmology , is electromagnetic radiation as a remnant from an early stage of the universe , also known as relic radiation . The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space . It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe , dating to the epoch of recombination . With a traditional optical telescope , the space between stars and galaxies ( the background ) is completely dark . However , a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise , or glow , almost isotropic , that is not associated with any star , galaxy , or other object . This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum . The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s , and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics . CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang origin of the universe . When the universe was young , before the formation of stars and planets , it was denser , much hotter , and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma . As the universe expanded , both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler . When the universe cooled enough , protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms . Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons , these newly conceived atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation by Thomson scattering , and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog .",
  "/wiki/Millimeter_Anisotropy_eXperiment_IMaging_Array": "The Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array ( MAXIMA ) experiment was a balloon-borne experiment funded by the U.S. NSF , NASA and Department of Energy , and operated by an international collaboration headed by the University of California , to measure the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background . It consisted of two flights , one in August 1998 and one in June 1999 . For each flight the balloon was started at the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Palestine , Texas and flew to an altitude of 40,000 metres for over 8 hours . For the first flight it took data from about 0.3 percent of the sky of the northern region near the Draco constellation . For the second flight , known as MAXIMA-II , twice the area was observed , this time in the direction of Ursa Major . Initially planned together with the BOOMERanG experiment , it split off during the planning phase to take a less risky approach by reducing flying time as well as launching and landing on U.S. territory .",
  "/wiki/BLAST_(telescope)": "The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope ( BLAST ) is a submillimeter telescope that hangs from a high-altitude balloon . It has a 2-meter primary mirror that directs light into bolometer arrays operating at 250 , 350 , and 500 \u00b5m . These arrays were developed for the SPIRE instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory . The project is carried out by a multi-university consortium headed by the University of Pennsylvania and which also includes University of Toronto , Brown University , the University of Miami , the University of British Columbia , JPL , INAOE , and Cardiff University . The third flight of BLAST in Antarctica was a scientific success , but much of telescope was destroyed after landing . It has been rebuilt for a flight from Antarctica in the 2010-11 austral summer . This most recent flight of BLAST ( aka BLAST-Pol ) has a polarimeter to observe the polarized light from star forming cores . The light is polarized due to magnetic fields . It is thought that the magnetic fields inhibit the collapse of the cores . The Herschel Space Observatory does not have a polarimeter . BLAST 's primary science goals are : Filmmaker Paul Devlin made a documentary film titled BLAST ! about the project .",
  "/wiki/Sunrise_(telescope)": "The Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory consists of a 1m aperture Gregory telescope , a UV filter imager , an imaging vector polarimeter , an image stabilization system and further infrastructure . The first science flight of Sunrise yielded high-quality data that reveal the structure , dynamics and evolution of solar convection , oscillations and magnetic fields at a resolution of around 100 km in the quiet Sun . The strong absorption of UV radiation by the Earth 's atmosphere makes it challenging to carry out ground-based observations at these wavelengths . A balloon mission reaching altitudes of above 30 km benefits from a reduction of UV absorption by 99% , making engineering solutions for the telescope easier . The launch site was in the arctic region to make uninterrupted observation of the Sun over several days possible . The telescope has a 1 metre primary mirror that directs the 1 kW of solar radiation to the first focal point where 99% of the radiation is reflected out of the telescope , the remaining light is transferred into several instruments . The one metre diameter primary mirror is made from a glass ceramic zerodur , it is the central part of the gondola of nearly 2 tons . Solar panels of 1.5 kW output power are used to power the onboard equipment and a hard disk array of 2 x 2.4 Terabyte is used to store the data during flight .",
  "/wiki/Adaptive_optics": "Adaptive optics ( AO ) is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of incoming wavefront distortions by deforming a mirror in order to compensate for the distortion . It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion , in microscopy , optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations . Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array . Adaptive optics should not be confused with active optics , which works on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry . Other methods can achieve resolving power exceeding the limit imposed by atmospheric distortion , such as speckle imaging , aperture synthesis , and lucky imaging , or by moving outside the atmosphere with space telescopes , such as the Hubble Space Telescope .",
