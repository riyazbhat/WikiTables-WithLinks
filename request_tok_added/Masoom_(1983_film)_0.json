They were initially referred to as the Clare Awards or The Clares after Clare Mendonca , the editor of The Times of India . A dual voting system was developed in 1956 . Under this system , in contrast to the National Film Awards , which are decided by a panel appointed by Indian Government , the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts . The ceremony had been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions . During several years in the 1990s , a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons .
