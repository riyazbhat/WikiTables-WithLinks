  "/wiki/Pole_position": "In motorsport the pole position is the position at the inside of the front row at the start of a racing event . This position is typically given to the vehicle and driver with the best qualifying time in the trials before the race ( the leader in the starting grid ) . This number-one qualifying driver is referred to as the pole sitter . Grid position is typically determined by a qualifying session prior to the race , where race participants compete to ascend to the number 1 grid slot , the driver , pilot , or rider having recorded fastest qualification time awarded the advantage of the number 1 grid slot ( i.e . pole-position ) ahead of all other vehicles for the start of the race . Historically , the fastest qualifier was not necessarily the designated pole-sitter . Different sanctioning bodies in motor sport employ different qualifying formats in designating who starts from pole position . Often , a starting grid is derived either by current rank in the championship , or based on finishing position of a previous race . In particularly important events where multiple qualification attempts spanned several days , the qualification result was segmented or staggered , by which session a driver qualified , or by which particular day a driver set his qualification time , only drivers having qualified on the initial day eligible for pole position . In a phenomenon known as race rigging , where race promoters or sanctioning bodies invert their starting grid for the purpose of entertainment value ( e.g. , pack racing ; to artificially stimulate passing ) , the slowest qualifier would be designated as pole-sitter . In contrast to contemporary motorsport , where only a race participant is designated pole-sitter , prior to World War II , the pace car was designated as official pole-sitter for the Indianapolis 500 .",
