  "/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)": "The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique . Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency . An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation ( except reprintings ) of a publication . For example , an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN . The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 , and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 . The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries , often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country . The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 , based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966 . The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 ( the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit ' 0 ' ) . Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN . The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative . Another identifier , the International Standard Serial Number ( ISSN ) , identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers . The International Standard Music Number ( ISMN ) covers musical scores .",

  "/wiki/Herding_Cats:_A_Life_in_Politics": "Herding Cats : A Life in Politics is a book written by U.S . Senator Trent Lott , a Republican from Mississippi . Published by HarperCollins Publishers , Inc. on August 23 , 2005 , the book spans 320 pages . The major points of the book are Lott 's childhood in Grenada and Pascagoula , Mississippi , including his struggles with his alcoholic father ; his election to Congress ; his years in the House of Representatives during the Nixon , Carter , and Reagan administrations ( including his service as Minority Whip in that body ) ; and his service in the Senate , especially his service as Majority Leader during the Clinton and Bush Administrations . He recounts the formative events of his youth and the stories from his political life . From his decision to support Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan in the 1976 Republican primary to his working partnership with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle during the Clinton impeachment and the September 11 attacks in 2001 , Lott traces the inner workings of congressional life . One major focus of the book is the comments Lott made at the birthday party of Sen. Strom Thurmond in 2002 and the subsequent intense media coverage , which eventually led to his resignation as the Senate Majority Leader in December 2002 . Lott names several figures who he believes orchestrated his downfall , including members of President George W. Bush 's administration , such as then-Secretary of State , Colin Powell , and former Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) head Joe Allbaugh ( who Lott claims has admitted that he intended to bring Lott down as Majority Leader ) ; as well as the successor to Lott as Majority Leader , Sen. Bill Frist . Lott suggests that his forced resignation was a strategic plan devised by Bush and others who wanted Frist to take his place , since Frist supported key White House policies like the Medicare expansion , which Lott opposed . Lott notes , however , that his response to the Thurmond controversy played poorly in the media . Lott wrote in the book that Frist betrayed him by not telling him about Frist 's decision to run for majority leader beforehand . Lott says he took Frist as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , as Frist had no political/public experience when he was first elected to the Senate .",
