  "/wiki/Hezb-e_Islami_Gulbuddin": "The Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin ( ; abbreviated HIG ) , also referred to as Hezb-e-Islami or Hezb-i-Islami Afghanistan ( HIA ) , is an Afghan political party and former militia , founded and led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . Since 1979 , when Mulavi Younas Khalis made a split with Hekmatyar and established his own group , the remaining part of Hezb-e Islami , still headed by Hekmatyar , was known as 'Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin ' or HIG . During the Soviet-Afghan War ( 1979-1989 ) , Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin was well-financed by anti-Soviet forces through the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) . In the mid-1990s , the HIG was sidelined from Afghan politics by the rise of the Taliban . In the post-2001 war in Afghanistan , HIG reemerged as an aggressive militant group , claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces and the administration of President Hamid Karzai . Its fighting strength was sometimes estimated to number in the thousands . The group signed a peace deal with the Ghani administration in 2016 .",
  "/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar": "Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ( ; ; born 1 August 1949 ) is an Afghan politician and former warlord . He is the founder and current leader of the Hezb-e Islami political party and twice served as Prime Minister of Afghanistan during the 1990s . Hekmaytar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s , where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization . He spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet occupation began in 1979 . The United States ' CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami mujahideen organization through the Pakistani ISI . He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War . Following the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992 , Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and he then with other warlords engaged in a civil war , leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone . Hekmatyar was accused of being the most responsible for rocket attacks on the city . In the meantime , as part of peace and power-sharing efforts by Ahmad Shah Massoud , Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996 , before the Taliban takeover of Kabul forced him to flee to Iran 's capital Tehran . Sometime after the Taliban 's fall in 2001 he went to Pakistan , leading his paramilitary to a new armed campaign against Hamid Karzai 's government and the international coalition in Afghanistan but was largely unsuccessful . In 2016 , he signed a peace deal with the Afghan government , allowing his return to Afghanistan after almost 20 years in exile . Hekmatyar remains a controversial figure - the New York Times once described him as perhaps the most brutal of a generally brutal group .",

The two parties were distinguished as Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and Hezb-e Islami Khalis , after the names of their respective leaders . The Khalis party was part of the Peshawar Seven , who fought against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan . Among its most famous commanders were Abdul Haq , Amin Wardak and Jalaluddin Haqqani . Following Khalis ' death in 2006 , a power struggle ensued between his son Anwar ul Haq Mujahid and Haji Din Mohammad , the former governor of Kabul Province . Mohammad appears to have been successful in consolidating his control over much of the party .",

His party was called Hezb-i-Islami ( Party of Islam ) , the same as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar 's party . The two are commonly differentiated as Hezb-e Islami Khalis and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin . He was a staunch conservative fundamentalist and virulently anti-Shia , though not - unlike Gulbadin Hekmatyar , his original commander with whom he severed his ties for being too extreme - a hardliner , and wrote the 1991 treatise An Appeal to Support the Holy War in the Sudan . After the fall of the communist government in 1992 , his forces controlled Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan . Maulvi Mohammad Yunus Khalis was born in 1919 in Khogyani District , Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan and became a powerful figure in his countrys turbulent modern history . Educated in Islamic law and theology , Khalis exercised influence through his conservative vision of Islamic society . Sometimes referred to as the don of Nangarhar , he was also a shrewd politician who wielded considerable power behind the scenes during one of the most turbulent and violent periods in his countrys history . After the overthrow of Mohammad Zahir Shah by Mohammad Daoud in 1973 , Khalis fled to Pakistan and joined Hekmatyar 's Islamic Party ( Hezb-e Islami ) . After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Khalis broke with Hekmatyar and established his own party ( Hezb-e Islami Khalis ) . Khalis reportedly entered Afghanistan many times to join his forces in waging war against the Soviets and their local proxies .

  "/wiki/Shura-e_Nazar": "The Shura-e Nazar ( ) ( known as the Supervisory Council of the North ) was created by Ahmad Shah Massoud in 1984 at the northern provinces of Takhar , Badakhshan , Balkh and Kunduz , during the Soviet-Afghan War . It comprised and united about 130 resistance commanders from 12 northern , eastern and central regions of Afghanistan . Though operating autonomously , Shura-e Nazar was technically an offshoot of Rabbani 's Jamiat-e Islami and hence operated within the framework of the Peshawar Seven against the Soviet-supported Democratic Republic of Afghanistan . Although many of the SCN leaders were affiliates of Rabbani 's Jamiat-e-Islami , the SCN established deep ties with local communities and ran its affairs independently from the Jamiat leadership , based in Pakistan .

Massoud came from an ethnic Tajik , Sunni Muslim background in the Panjshir valley of northern Afghanistan . He began studying engineering at Polytechnical University of Kabul in the 1970s , where he became involved with religious anti-communist movements around Burhanuddin Rabbani , a leading Islamist . He was part of a failed uprising against Mohammed Daoud Khan 's government . He later joined Rabbani 's Jamiat-e Islami party . During the Soviet-Afghan War , his role as a powerful mujahideen insurgent leader earned him the nickname of Lion of Panjshir ( ) among his followers as he successfully resisted the Soviets from taking Panjshir Valley . In 1992 he signed the Peshawar Accord , a peace and power-sharing agreement , in the post-communist Islamic State of Afghanistan , and was so appointed as the Minister of Defense as well as the government 's main military commander . His militia fought to defend the capital Kabul against militias led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and other warlords who were bombing the city - and eventually the Taliban , who started to lay siege to the capital in January 1995 after the city had seen fierce fighting with at least 60,000 civilians killed . Following the rise of the Taliban in 1996 , Massoud , who rejected the Taliban 's fundamentalist interpretation of Islam , returned to armed opposition until he eventually fled to Kulob , Tajikistan , strategically destroying the Salang Tunnel on his way north . He became the military and political leader of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan or Northern Alliance , which by 2000 controlled only between 5 and 10 percent of the country .",
