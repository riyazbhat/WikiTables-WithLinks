  "/wiki/Fiat_CR.42bis_Falco": "The Fiat CR.42 Falco ( Falcon , plural : Falchi ) was a single-seat sesquiplane fighter developed and produced by Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione . It served primarily in Italy 's Regia Aeronautica both before and during the Second World War . The CR.42 was an evolutionary design of Fiats earlier CR.32 fighter , featuring a more powerful supercharged Fiat A.74R1C.38 air-cooled radial engine and aerodynamic improvements to its relatively clean exterior surfaces . The aircraft proved to be relatively agile in flight , a factor that had been attributed to its very low wing loading and a sometimes decisive tactical advantage . RAF Intelligence praised its exceptional maneuverability , further noting that the plane was immensely strong , though it was technically outclassed by faster , more heavily armed monoplanes . While primarily used as a fighter , various other roles were adopted for some variants of the type , such as the CR.42N dedicated night fighter model , the CR.42AS ground attack aircraft , and the CR.42B Biposto twin-seat trainer aircraft . During May 1939 , the CR.42 entered service with the Regia Aeronautica ; it was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service . By 10 June 1940 , the date when Italy entered the Second World War , roughly 300 of the type had been delivered , which were initially tasked with defending Italy 's cities and key military installations . By the end of 1940 , the Falco had been involved in combat on various fronts , including the Battle of France , the Battle of Britain , Malta , North Africa , and Greece . By the end of the war , Italian CR.42s had been used on further fronts , including Iraq , the Eastern Front and the Italian mainland . Following the signing of the Italian armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 , the type was primarily relegated to use as a trainer by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force , while some Italian CR.42s were seized by the Germans and used by the Luftwaffe to perform ground attack missions . In addition to its service in Italy , the CR.42 was produced and entered service in smaller numbers with the air forces of several nations , including Belgium , Sweden and Hungary .",

  "/wiki/Gloster_Gladiator": "The Gloster Gladiator ( or Gloster SS.37 ) was a British-built biplane fighter . It was used by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) ( as the Sea Gladiator variant ) and was exported to a number of other air forces during the late 1930s . It was the RAF 's last biplane fighter aircraft and was rendered obsolete by newer monoplane designs even as it was being introduced . Though often pitted against more formidable foes during the early days of the Second World War , it acquitted itself reasonably well in combat . The Gladiator saw action in almost all theatres during the Second World War , with a large number of air forces , some of them on the Axis side . The RAF used it in France , Norway , Greece , the defence of Malta , the Middle East , and the brief Anglo-Iraqi War ( during which the Royal Iraqi Air Force was similarly equipped ) . Other countries deploying the Gladiator included China against Japan , beginning in 1938 ; Finland ( along with Swedish volunteers ) against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War ; Sweden as a neutral non-combatant ( although Swedish volunteers fought for Finland against USSR as stated above ) ; and Norway , Belgium , and Greece resisting Axis invasion of their respective lands . The South African pilot Marmaduke Pat Pattle was the top Gladiator ace with 15 victories with the type .",

  "/wiki/Reggiane_Re.2000": "The Reggiane Re 2000 Falco I was an Italian all metal , low-wing monoplane developed and manufactured by aircraft company Reggiane . The type was used extensively by the Regia Aeronautica ( Italian Air Force ) and the Swedish Air Force during the first part of the Second World War . The Re 2000 was developed by a team headed by aircraft designers Roberto Longhi and Antonio Alessio to be a lightly-built and highly maneuverable interceptor/fighter aircraft . The emergent design , which had been designated as the Re 2000 Falco I , was equipped with a Curtiss-Wright-style retractable undercarriage , bore substantial similarities to the American-built Seversky P-35 . On 24 May 1939 , the prototype performed its maiden flight . Flight testing of the prototype revealed it to be able to outfight several significant combat aircraft of the time , including even the more modern Macchi C 200 and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters . During the run up to and following the outbreak of the Second World War , the aircraft was ordered by several nations , including the Hungarian , Swedish , British and Italian governments . Upon entering squadron service , the Re 2000 soon proved to be a technically advanced aircraft , being well balanced and extremely aerodynamic during flight , but was not without its faults . Although the aircraft was potentially superior to Italian contemporary fighters ( Fiat G 50 and Macchi C 200 ) , the Re 2000 was not considered to be satisfactory by Italian military authorities . Consequently , the manufacturer built the type for export and almost all of the first production served with the Swedish Air Force and Hungarian Air Force , rather than in the Regia Aeronautica . The Re.2000 served as the starting point for several derivatives , including the M\u00c1VAG H\u00e9ja , Reggiane Re.2001 , Re.2002 , Re.2003 , Re.2004 , Re.2005 , Re.2006 and Re.2007 combat aircraft .",
