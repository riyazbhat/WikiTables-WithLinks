Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school , the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism , which was formally headed by the Ganden Tripas . From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959 , the central government of Tibet , the Ganden Phodrang , invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties . The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser , Amdo , Tibet . He was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama in a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939 . On 26 January 1940 , the Regent Reting Rinpoche requested the Central Government to exempt Tenzin Gyatso from the lot-drawing process of the Golden Urn to become the 14th Dalai Lama . The request was approved by the Central Government . His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 and he eventually assumed full temporal ( political ) duties on 17 November 1950 , at the age of 15 , after the People 's Republic of China 's occupation of Tibet . The Gelug school 's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region , just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it . During the 1959 Tibetan uprising , the Dalai Lama fled to India , where he currently lives as a refugee . He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans , environment , economics , women 's rights , nonviolence , interfaith dialogue , physics , astronomy , Buddhism and science , cognitive neuroscience , reproductive health , and sexuality , along with various topics of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist teachings .
