Born and raised in La Goulette , a neighbourhood of Tunis , Cardinale won the Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia competition in 1957 , the prize being a trip to Italy , which quickly led to film contracts , due above all to the involvement of Franco Cristaldi , who acted as her mentor for a number of years and later married her . After making her debut in a minor role with Omar Sharif in Goha ( 1958 ) , Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy after roles in films such as Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) , Girl with a Suitcase ( 1961 ) , Cartouche ( 1962 ) , The Leopard ( 1963 ) , and Fellini 's 8\u00bd ( 1963 ) .

Based on Kenneth Cook 's 1961 novel of the same name , the film follows a young English schoolteacher who descends into personal moral degradation after finding himself stranded in a brutal , menacing town in outback Australia . Filmed on location in Broken Hill and Sydney , Wake in Fright was an Australian-American co-production between NLT Productions and Westinghouse Broadcasting . Alongside Walkabout , it was one of two Australian films to be nominated for the Grand Prix du Festival at the 24th Cannes Film Festival . Despite attracting positive reviews , the film was a commercial failure in Australia , in part due to minimal promotion by United Artists , as well as audiences being uncomfortable with its portrayal of outback life , including a controversial hunting scene involving real kangaroos being shot . By the 1990s , Wake in Fright had developed a cult reputation as Australia 's great lost film because its master negative had gone missing , resulting in censored prints of degraded quality being used for its few television broadcasts and VHS releases . After the original film and sound elements were rescued by editor Anthony Buckley in 2004 , the film was digitally remastered and given a 2009 re-release at Cannes and in Australian theatres to widespread acclaim ; it was issued commercially on DVD and Blu-ray later that year .
