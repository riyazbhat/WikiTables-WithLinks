Their primary participation in this age group comes at the International Ice Hockey Federation 's World Junior Championship , held annually every December and January . The team also participates in various exhibition matches and occasional exhibition series , such as the 2007 Super Series against their Russian counterparts , an eight-game exhibition series commemorating the 35th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series . The national junior team is extremely popular in Canada , even more so than the men 's senior team which plays at the World Championships . World Junior events in Canada are often sold out , television ratings are extremely high , and even events in Europe are well attended by a contingent of Canadian fans . The Canadian junior team is one of the most successful in the world , having medalled in 32 of 44 events held since 1977 , winning a record 18 gold medals . Its success can be traced back to the formation of the Program of Excellence in 1982 by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association , which created the first true national junior team .
