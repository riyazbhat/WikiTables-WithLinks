The British branch of the label was founded on 8 August 1923 as The Parlophone Company Limited ( The Parlophone Co. Ltd. ) , which developed a reputation in the 1920s as a jazz record label . On 5 October 1926 , the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired Parlophone 's business , name , logo , and release library , and merged with the Gramophone Company on 31 March 1931 to become Electric & Musical Industries Limited ( EMI ) . George Martin joined Parlophone in 1950 as assistant label manager , taking over as manager in 1955 . Martin produced and released a mix of recordings , including by comedian Peter Sellers , pianist Mrs Mills , and teen idol Adam Faith . In 1962 , Martin signed the Beatles , at the time a struggling band from Liverpool . During the 1960s , when Cilla Black , Billy J. Kramer , the Fourmost , and the Hollies also signed , Parlophone became one of the world 's most famous labels . For several years , Parlophone claimed the best-selling UK single , She Loves You , and the best-selling UK album , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , both by the Beatles . The label placed seven singles at No . 1 during 1964 , when it claimed top spot on the UK Albums Chart for 40 weeks .

The American version of the album was released two weeks earlier , on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records , with a different track listing . In contrast to the Beatles ' first two albums , all 13 tracks on A Hard Day 's Night were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , showcasing the development of their songwriting partnership . The album includes the song A Hard Day 's Night , with its distinctive opening chord , and Ca n't Buy Me Love , both transatlantic number-one singles for the band . Several of the songs feature George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar , a sound that was influential on the Byrds and on other groups in the folk rock movement . The title of the album was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr . According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine : I was going home in the car and [ film director ] Dick Lester suggested the title , 'Hard Day 's Night ' from something Ringo had said . I had used it in In His Own Write , but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo . You know , one of those malapropisms . A Ringo-ism , where he said it not to be funny . just said it . So Dick Lester said , 'We are going to use that title . '",
  "/wiki/Beatles_for_Sale": "Beatles for Sale is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles . It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI 's Parlophone label . The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised the Beatles ' previous work , partly due to the band 's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964 . Beatles for Sale was not released in the US until 1987 , when the Beatles ' catalogue was standardised for release on CD . Instead , eight of the album 's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records ' concurrent release , Beatles '65 , issued in North America only . The Beatles recorded the album at EMI Studios in London in between their touring and radio engagements . The songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics , with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in compositions such as I 'm a Loser and No Reply . The album also reflected the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan , whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964 . Partly as a result of the group 's hectic schedule , only eight of the tracks are original compositions , with cover versions of songs by artists such as Carl Perkins , Chuck Berry , Buddy Holly and Little Richard being used to complete the album . The sessions also produced a non-album single , I Feel Fine backed by She 's a Woman . Beatles for Sale received favourable reviews in the UK musical press , where it held the number one spot for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20 . The album was similarly successful in Australia , where the band 's cover of Berry 's Rock and Roll Music also topped the singles chart .",

It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom , on EMI 's Parlophone label , accompanied by the non-album double A-side single Day Tripper / We Can Work It Out . The original North American version of the album , issued by Capitol Records , contained ten of the fourteen songs and two tracks withheld from the band 's Help ! album .

The recording sessions took place in London over a four-week period beginning in October 1965 . For the first time in their career , the band were able to record an album free of concert , radio or film commitments . Often referred to as a folk rock album , particularly in its Capitol configuration , Rubber Soul incorporates a mix of pop , soul and folk musical styles . The title derives from the colloquialism plastic soul and was the Beatles ' way of acknowledging their lack of authenticity compared to the African-American soul artists they admired . After A Hard Day 's Night in 1964 , it was the second Beatles LP to contain only original material . The songs demonstrate the Beatles ' increasing maturity as lyricists and , in their incorporation of brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as sitar , harmonium and fuzz bass , the group striving for more expressive sounds and arrangements for their music .

  "/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles . It was released on 5 August 1966 , accompanied by the double A-side single Eleanor Rigby / Yellow Submarine . The album was the Beatles ' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group 's most overt use of studio technology to date , building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul . It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in popular music , with recognition centred on its range of musical styles , diverse sounds , and lyrical content . The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966 , and during a period when London was feted as the era 's cultural capital . The songs reflect the group 's interest in the drug LSD , Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns . With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert , the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking , varispeed , reversed tapes , close audio miking , and instruments outside of their standard live set-up . Among its innovative tracks are the psychedelic Tomorrow Never Knows , recorded using tape loops controlled on several machines simultaneously ; Eleanor Rigby , a meditation on loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing ; and Love You To , a foray into Hindustani classical music . The sessions also produced a non-album single , Paperback Writer backed with Rain . In the United Kingdom , the album 's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release . In North America , Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records , with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today . The release there coincided with the Beatles ' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon 's remark that the band had become more popular than Jesus .",

It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production , songwriting and graphic design , for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art , and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture . It won four Grammy Awards in 1968 , including Album of the Year , the first rock LP to receive this honour . In August 1966 , the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday . During a return flight to London in November , Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt . Pepper concept . Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with two compositions inspired by the Beatles ' youth , Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane , but after pressure from EMI , the songs were released as a double A-side single and left off the album . In February 1967 , after recording the title track , McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt . Pepper band .

  "/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)": "The Beatles , also known as the White Album , is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles , released on 22 November 1968 . Its plain white sleeve has no graphics or text other than the band 's name embossed , [ a ] which was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band 's previous LP Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres , including folk , British blues , ska , music hall and the avant-garde . It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work , as well as among the greatest albums of all time . Most of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh , India . There , the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar ; some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo , or only by part of the group . The production aesthetic ensured that the album 's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation , relative to all their releases since 1966 's Revolver . The Beatles also broke with the band 's recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre . At the end of May 1968 , the Beatles returned to EMI Studios in London to commence recording sessions that lasted through to mid-October . During these sessions , arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and John Lennon 's new partner , Yoko Ono , whose constant presence subverted the Beatles ' policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio . After a series of problems , including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick suddenly quitting , Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August .",

Some songs were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack , while others were unreleased tracks from other projects . The album was recorded before - and issued two months after - the band 's self-titled double LP ( also known as the White Album ) and was not viewed by the band as a significant release . An EP containing only the new songs had been considered for release , and was mastered , but left unreleased . The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters . Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US . It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics , some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles ' work .

Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece . The sessions also produced a non-album single , The Ballad of John and Yoko backed with Old Brown Shoe . Producer George Martin returned on the condition that the Beatles adhere to the discipline of their earlier records .

Like most of the band 's previous releases , the album topped record charts in many countries , including both the US and the UK . However , the critical response was generally unfavourable , and Let It Be came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever . Rehearsals began at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles ' return to live performance . Paul McCartney conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler rock and roll configurations . The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling , leading to George Harrison 's temporary departure from the group . As a condition of his return , the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio with guest keyboardist Billy Preston . The project then yielded a single public concert , held impromptu on the studio 's rooftop on 30 January , from which three of the album 's tracks were drawn . In April 1969 , the Beatles issued the single Get Back , after which engineer Glyn Johns proposed rejected mixes of the album , then titled Get Back , that were widely bootlegged before release . From then , the project lay in limbo as they moved onto the recording of Abbey Road , released that September . By then , John Lennon had departed the group .",
