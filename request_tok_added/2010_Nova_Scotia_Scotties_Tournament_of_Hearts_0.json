Dartmouth is located on the eastern shore of Halifax Harbour . Dartmouth has been nicknamed the City of Lakes , after the large number of lakes located within its boundaries . On April 1 , 1996 , the provincial government amalgamated all the municipalities within the boundaries of Halifax County into a single-tier regional government named the Halifax Regional Municipality ( HRM ) . Dartmouth and its neighbouring city of Halifax , the town of Bedford and the Municipality of the County of Halifax were dissolved . The city of Dartmouth forms part of the urban core of the larger regional municipality and is officially designated as part of the capital district by the Halifax Regional Municipality . At the time that the City of Dartmouth was dissolved , the provincial government altered its status to a separate community to Halifax ; however , its status as part of the metropolitan Halifax urban core existed prior to municipal reorganization in 1996 . Dartmouth is still an official geographic name that is used by all levels of government for legal purposes , postal service , mapping , 9-1-1 emergency response , municipal planning , and is recognized by the Halifax Regional Municipality as a civic addressing community . The official place name did not change , due to the confusion with similar street names , land use planning set out by the former City of Dartmouth , and significant public pressure . Today the same development planning for Downtown Dartmouth and the rest of the region is still in force , as well as specific bylaws created prior to April 1 , 1996 .",
