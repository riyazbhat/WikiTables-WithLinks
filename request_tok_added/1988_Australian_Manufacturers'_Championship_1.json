Skylines are available in either coupe , or sedan body styles , plus station wagon , crossover , convertible and pickup/sedan delivery body styles . The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights ( as of 1972 ) .

The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive , with four-wheel drive being available since the eighth-generation 's debut . The eleventh-generation Skyline ( V35 ) was another major turning point for the nameplate , as it dropped some of the previous generation Skyline 's trademark characteristics such as the straight-six engine ( replaced with a V6 ) and turbocharging , and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line . Nissan decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market , while its platform-mate , the 350Z , revived the Z line of pure sports cars . The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America , being sold under Nissan 's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35 in 2002 . The Skyline ( V36/J50 ) is sold in Europe , North America , South Korea , Taiwan , and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 .
