Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786 , in order to remain within close reach of Iran 's territories in the Caucasus , before being separated from Iran as a result of the Russo-Iranian Wars , and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties . The capital has been moved several times throughout history , and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran . Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s , and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century . Tehran is home to many historical collections , including the royal complexes of Golestan , Sa'dabad , and Niavaran , where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated . Tehran 's most famous landmarks include the Azadi Tower , a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran , and the Milad Tower , the world 's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower which was completed in 2007 .

  "/wiki/Friendly_match": "An exhibition game ( also known as a friendly , a scrimmage , a demonstration , a preseason game , a warmup match , or a preparation match , depending at least in part on the sport ) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player 's or the team 's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced . In team sports , matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament . If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues , exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other . The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team . An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge , to provide professional entertainment , to promote the sport , to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player , or to raise money for charities .
