  "/wiki/Scream_2": "Scream 2 is a 1997 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson . It stars David Arquette , Neve Campbell , Courteney Cox , Sarah Michelle Gellar , Jamie Kennedy , Laurie Metcalf , Jerry O'Connell , Jada Pinkett and Liev Schreiber . The film was released on December 12 , 1997 , less than a year after the first , by Dimension Films as the second installment in the Scream film series . The film takes place two years after the first film and again follows the character of Sidney Prescott ( Campbell ) , now a student at the fictional Windsor College , who becomes the target of a copycat killer using the guise of Ghostface . Sidney is accompanied by film geek Randy Meeks ( Kennedy ) , retired deputy sheriff Dewey Riley ( Arquette ) and news reporter Gale Weathers ( Cox ) . Like its predecessor , Scream 2 combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of comedy and whodunit mystery while satirizing the clich\u00e9 of film sequels . The film was followed by two sequels , Scream 3 ( 2000 ) and Scream 4 ( 2011 ) . Williamson provided a five-page outline for a sequel to Scream when auctioning his original script , hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise . Following a successful test screening of Scream and the film 's financial and critical success , Dimension moved forward with the sequel while Scream was still in theaters , with the principal cast all returning to star , Craven to direct and Beltrami to provide music . The film suffered controversy following its significant issues with plot information leaking onto the Internet , revealing the identity of the killers . Combined with the film 's rushed schedule , the script was rewritten often ; pages were sometimes completed on the day of filming . Despite these issues , Scream 2 earned $ 172 million at the box office and received several awards and nominations .",
