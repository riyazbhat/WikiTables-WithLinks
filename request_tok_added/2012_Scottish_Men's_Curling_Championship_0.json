It is Scotland 's third most populous city , one of Scotland 's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom 's 39th most populous built-up area , with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen and 227,560 for the local council area . During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 . In 2015 , Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain .",

It is the administrative centre of Perth and Kinross council area and the historic county town of Perthshire . It had a population of about 47,180 in 2012 .

During the later medieval period the city was also called St John 's Toun or Saint Johnstoun by its inhabitants in reference to the main church dedicated to St John the Baptist . This name is preserved by the city 's football club , St Johnstone F.C . There has been a settlement at Perth since prehistoric times , on a natural mound raised slightly above the flood plain of the Tay , where the river could be crossed at low tide . The area surrounding the modern city is known to have been occupied since Mesolithic hunter-gatherers arrived more than 8,000 years ago . Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles also exist , dating from about 4000 BC , following the introduction of farming in the area . The presence of Scone Abbey , home of the Stone of Scone ( also known as the Stone of Destiny ) where the King of Scots was crowned , enhanced the early importance of the city . Perth became known as a 'capital ' of Scotland , due to the frequent residence of the royal court . Royal Burgh status was soon given to the city by King William the Lion in the early 12th century .",

The market town , surrounded by rich farmland , grew up connecting the royal citadel , the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen , the bridge and the port . Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",
