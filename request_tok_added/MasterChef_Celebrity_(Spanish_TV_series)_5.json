It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir , in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula . Seville has a municipal population of about 690,000 as of 2016 [ update ] , and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million , making it the largest city in Andalusia , the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union .

Seville experiences high temperatures in the Summer , with daily maximums routinely above 35 \u00b0C ( 95 \u00b0F ) in July and August . Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis . It became known as Ishbiliyya after the Muslim conquest in 712 . During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 . After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz .",
