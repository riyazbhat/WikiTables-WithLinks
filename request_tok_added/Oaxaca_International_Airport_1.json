The State of Mexico is often abbreviated to Edomex from Estado de M\u00e9xico in Spanish , to distinguish it from the name of the whole country . It is located in South-Central Mexico . It is bordered by the states of Quer\u00e9taro and Hidalgo to the north , Morelos and Guerrero to the south , Michoac\u00e1n to the west , Tlaxcala and Puebla to the east , and surrounds Mexico City ( the former Federal District ) on three sides . The state 's origins are in the territory of the Aztec Empire , which remained a political division of New Spain during the Spanish colonial period . After gaining independence , Mexico City was chosen as the capital of the new nation ; its territory was separated out of the state . Years later , parts of the state were broken off to form the states of Hidalgo , Guerrero and Morelos . These territorial separations have left the state with the size and shape it has today , with the Toluca Valley to the west of Mexico City and a panhandle that extends around the north and east of this entity . The state name is simply M\u00e9xico according to the 1917 Constitution of the United Mexican States , but to distinguish it from both the city and the country it is most often called Estado de M\u00e9xico . The demonym used to refer to people and things from the state is mexiquense , distinct from mexicano ( Mexican ) , which describes the people or things from the country as a whole .",
