  "/wiki/Irreligion": "Irreligion ( adjective form : non-religious or irreligious ) is the absence , indifference to , or rejection of religion . According to the Pew Research Center 's 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories , 16% of the world 's population is not affiliated with a religion , while 84% are affiliated . Irreligion may include some forms of theism , depending on the religious context it is defined against ; for example , in 18th-century Europe , the epitome of irreligion was deism , while in contemporary East Asia the shared term meaning irreligion or no religion ( \u7121\u5b97\u6559 , Chinese pron . w\u00fa z\u014dngji\u00e0o , Japanese pron . mu sh\u016bky\u014d Korean pron . mujonggyo ) , with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves , implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions ( such as Buddhism and Christianity ) and not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese Shendao and Japanese Shinto ( both meaning ways of gods ) . According to cross-cultural studies , since religion and fertility are positively related while secularism and fertility are negatively related , secularism is expected to decline throughout the 21st century . By 2060 , according to their projections , the number of unaffiliated will increase by over 35 million , but the percentage will decrease to 13% because the total population will grow faster .",
  "/wiki/Atheism": "Atheism is , in the broadest sense , an absence of belief in the existence of deities . Less broadly , atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist . In an even narrower sense , atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities . Atheism is contrasted with theism , which , in its most general form , is the belief that at least one deity exists . The etymological root for the word atheism originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek ( atheos ) , meaning without god ( s ) . In antiquity , it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society , those who were forsaken by the gods , or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods . The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed . The actual term atheism emerged first in the 16th century . With the spread of freethought , skeptical inquiry , and subsequent increase in criticism of religion , application of the term narrowed in scope . The first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment . The French Revolution , noted for its unprecedented atheism , witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason . Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches .",
