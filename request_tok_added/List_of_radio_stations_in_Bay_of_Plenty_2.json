  "/wiki/World_music": "World music ( also called global music or international music ) is a Western musical category encompassing many different styles of music from other parts of the globe . It includes many forms of music that Westerners consider ethnic , indigenous music , folk music , neotraditional music , and music where more than one cultural tradition , such as non-Western music and Western popular music , intermingle . World music 's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose some obstacles to a universal definition , but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine 's description of the genre as local music from out there . The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music . It has grown to include subgenres such as ethnic fusion ( Clannad , Ry Cooder , Enya , etc . ) and worldbeat .",

  "/wiki/Community_radio": "Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting . Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest . They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local , specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters . Community radio stations are operated , owned , and influenced by the communities they serve . They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals , groups , and communities to tell their own stories , to share experiences and , in a media-rich world , to become creators and contributors of media . In many parts of the world , community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector , civil society , agencies , NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims , in addition to broadcasting . There is legally defined community radio ( as a distinct broadcasting sector ) in many countries , such as France , Argentina , South Africa , Australia and Ireland . Much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit , social objectives and social gain as part of the definition . Community radio has developed differently in different countries , and the term has somewhat different meanings in the United Kingdom , Ireland , the United States , Canada and Australia , where freedom of speech laws and de facto realities differ .",

  "/wiki/Dance_music": "Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing . It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement . In terms of performance , the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music . While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times ( for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians ) , the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances . In the Baroque period , the major dance styles were noble court dances ( see Baroque dance ) . In the classical music era , the minuet was frequently used as a third movement , although in this context it would not accompany any dancing . The waltz also arose later in the classical era . Both remained part of the romantic music period , which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle , mazurka , ecossaise , ballade and polonaise . Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century 's Western ballroom and social dance music . During the early 20th century , ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls . Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s . In the 1930s , called the Swing era , Swing music was the popular dance music in America ."
