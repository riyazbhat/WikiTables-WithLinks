  "/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine": "The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism is a 2007 book by the Canadian author and social activist Naomi Klein . In the book , Klein argues that neoliberal free market policies ( as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman ) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy of shock therapy . This centers on the exploitation of national crises to push through controversial policies while citizens are too emotionally and physically distracted by disasters or upheavals to mount an effective resistance . The book suggests that some man-made events , such as the Iraq War , were undertaken with the intention of pushing through such unpopular policies in their wake . Some reviewers criticized the book for making what they viewed as simplifications of political phenomena , while others lauded it as a compelling and important work . The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by Michael Winterbottom .",
