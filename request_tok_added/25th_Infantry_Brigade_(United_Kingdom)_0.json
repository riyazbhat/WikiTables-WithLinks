It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879 . Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857 , two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch . These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace . The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War . Since then , the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients . Only 15 medals , of which 11 were to members of the British Army and four were to members of the Australian Army , have been awarded since the Second World War .
