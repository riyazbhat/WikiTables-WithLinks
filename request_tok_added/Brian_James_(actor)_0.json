It stars Mick Molloy , Bob Franklin and Judith Lucy , with Alan Brough , Bill Hunter , Marshall Napier , Nicholas Bell , Steven Vidler , Shaun Micallef , Robyn Nevin , Brett Swain , Denis Moore and Pete Smith having supporting roles . Ben Kinnear ( Molloy ) and Mike Paddock ( Franklin ) are police officers working for the Zero Tolerance Unit , a special division of Victoria Police . When they accidentally shoot the corpse of a judge several times each , they are reprimanded but investigate his death , leading to several other accidents , for which they are relegated to uniform duty . Through Julie Bale ( Lucy ) , a former police officer and Kinnear 's ex , they uncover a conspiracy involving the ZTU with bribery and corruption . They are joined by computer operator Northey ( Brough ) , but have to escape with their lives to avoid death at the hands of the ZTU 's commander , Ted Pratt ( Hunter ) and the network of corruption extending all the way to the Premier of Victoria ( Micallef ) . As befits a film written by Tony Martin , the humour in the movie was quite intelligent and sophisticated , though a lot of it came through one-liners and slapstick . The film marked Martin 's directorial debut . Much of the cast and crew , including Molloy , Hunter , Martin and Lucy , had all worked on a previous film Crackerjack ( 2002 ) . The film performed moderately well at the Australian box-office and was also released in New Zealand and Germany . Molloy 's talent as an actor was praised in some circles , as was the ARIA Award-nominated soundtrack by Dave Graney and Clare Moore ."
