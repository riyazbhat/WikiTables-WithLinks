  "/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario": "Kingston is a city in Eastern Ontario , Canada . It is on the eastern end of Lake Ontario , at the beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River ( south end of the Rideau Canal ) . The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 . Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac .",

  "/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick": "Saint John is a port city on the Bay of Fundy in the Canadian province of New Brunswick . The port is Canada 's third largest port by tonnage with a cargo base that includes dry and liquid bulk , break bulk , containers , and cruise . Historically New Brunswick 's largest city , in 2016 the city fell to second place , with a population of 67,575 over an area of 315.82 km2 ( 121.94 sq mi ) . Greater Saint John covers a land area of 3,362.95 km2 ( 1,298.44 sq mi ) across the Caledonia Highlands , with a growing population of 126,202 ( as of 2016 ) . Saint John is the oldest incorporated city in Canada . During the reign of George III , the municipality was created by royal charter in 1785 . Saint John is the oldest of five chartered cities in Canada along with Montreal , Winnipeg , Vancouver , and Lloydminster ( a city that straddles both Alberta and Saskatchewan ) . French colonist Samuel de Champlain landed at Saint John Harbour on June 24 , 1604 ( the feast of St. John the Baptist ) and is where the Saint John River gets its name although Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples lived in the region for thousands of years prior calling the river Wolastoq . The Saint John area was an important area for trade and defence for Acadia during the French colonial era and Fort La Tour , in the city 's harbour , was a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War . After over a century of ownership disputes over the land surrounding Saint John between the French and English , the English deported the French colonists in 1755 and constructed Fort Howe above the harbour in 1779 . In 1785 , the City of Saint John was established by uniting the two towns of Parrtown and Carleton on each side of the harbour after the arrival of thousands of refugees from the American Revolution who wished to remain British and were forced to leave their U.S. homes . Over the next century , waves of immigration via Partridge Island , especially during the Great Famine , would fundamentally change the city 's demographics and culture .",
