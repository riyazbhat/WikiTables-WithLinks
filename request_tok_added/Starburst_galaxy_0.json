  "/wiki/Messier_82": "Messier 82 ( also known as NGC 3034 , Cigar Galaxy or M82 ) is a starburst galaxy approximately 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major . A member of the M81 Group , it is about five times more luminous than the whole Milky Way and has a center one hundred times more luminous than our galaxy 's center . The starburst activity is thought to have been triggered by interaction with neighboring galaxy M81 . As the closest starburst galaxy to Earth , M82 is the prototypical example of this galaxy type . SN 2014J , a type Ia supernova , was discovered in the galaxy on 21 January 2014 . In 2014 , in studying M82 , scientists discovered the brightest pulsar yet known , designated M82 X-2 .",
  "/wiki/The_Antennae": "The Antennae Galaxies , also known as NGC 4038/NGC 4039 , are a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Corvus . They are currently going through a starburst phase , in which the collision of clouds of gas and dust , with entangled magnetic fields , causes rapid star formation . They were discovered by William Herschel in 1785 .",
  "/wiki/IC_10": "IC 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia . It was discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887 and in 1935 Nicholas Mayall became the first to suggest that the object is extragalactic . Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies , but its status remained uncertain for decades . The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962 , and it was found to be approaching the Milky Way at approximately 350 km/s , strengthening the evidence for its membership in the Local Group . Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by direct measurements of its distance based on observations of Cepheids . Despite its closeness , the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the plane of the Milky Way and is therefore heavily obscured by interstellar matter . The apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy , which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup . IC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies . It has many more Wolf-Rayet stars per square kiloparsec ( 5.1 stars/kpc ) than the Large Magellanic Cloud ( 2.0 stars/kpc ) or the Small Magellanic Cloud ( 0.9 stars/kpc ) . Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC , it is considerably smaller . Its higher metallicity compared to the SMC suggests that star formation activity has continued for a longer time period . The evolutionary status of the Wolf-Rayet stars suggests that they all formed in a relatively short timespan .",
  "/wiki/HXMM01": "HXMM01 , known more formally as 1HERMES S250 J022016.5\u2212060143 , is a starburst galaxy located in the northwestern portion of the constellation Cetus . Discovered in 2013 by a team at the University of California , Irvine , it was discovered that HXMM01 is actually still forming from its two parent galaxies as part of the brightest , most luminous and most gas-rich submillimeter-bright galaxy merger known . When the merger is complete , HXMM01 will rapidly evolve to become a giant elliptical galaxy with a mass about four times that of the Milky Way . As of 2013 , HXMM01 has been observed to form about of stars every year , with an efficiency ten times greater than that of typical galaxies and far more than the Milky Way 's per year .",
  "/wiki/HFLS3": "HFLS3 is the name for a distant galaxy , located at z = 6.34 , originating about 880 million years after the Big Bang . Its discovery was announced on 18 April 2013 as an exceptional starburst galaxy producing nearly 3,000 solar masses of stars a year . It was found by using the far infrared capable Herschel Space Telescope . The galaxy was estimated to have 35 billion stars . It is 10-30 times the mass of other known galaxies at such an early time in the Universe . HFLS3 was subjected to a follow-up campaign by other telescopes due to its high redness . HFLS3 was found in the HerMES campaign , which also found other very red sources .",
  "/wiki/NGC_1569": "The NGC 1569 is a dwarf irregular galaxy in Camelopardalis . The galaxy is relatively nearby . Consequently , the Hubble Space Telescope can easily resolve the stars within the galaxy . The distance to the galaxy was previously believed to be only 2.4 Mpc ( 7.8 Mly ) . However , in 2008 scientists studying images from Hubble calculated the galaxy 's distance at nearly 11 million light-years away , about 4 million light-years farther than previous thought : therefore the galaxy resulted to be a member of the IC 342 group of galaxies .",
  "/wiki/NGC_2146": "NGC 2146 is a barred spiral galaxy type SB ( s ) ab pec in the constellation Camelopardalis . The galaxy was discovered in 1876 by Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke . It has a diameter of 80,000 lyr . The galaxy 's most conspicuous feature is the dusty lanes of a spiral arm lying across the core of the galaxy as seen from Earth , the arm having been bent 45 degrees by a close encounter with a smaller galaxy possibly NGC 2146a about 0.8 billion years ago . This close encounter is credited with the relatively high rates of star formation that qualify NGC 2146 as a starburst galaxy .",
  "/wiki/NGC_1705": "NGC 1705 is a peculiar lenticular galaxy and a blue compact dwarf galaxy in the constellation Pictor , undergoing a starburst . It is estimated to be approximately 17 million light-years from the Earth . It is a member of the Dorado Group .",
  "/wiki/NGC_1614": "NGC 1614 is the New General Catalogue identifier for a spiral galaxy in the equatorial constellation of Eridanus . It was discovered on December 29 , 1885 by American astronomer Lewis Swift , who described it in a shorthand notation as : pretty faint , small , round , a little brighter middle . The nebula was then catalogued by Danish-Irish astronomer J. L. E. Drayer in 1888 . When direct photography became available , it was noted that this galaxy displayed some conspicuous peculiarities . American astronomer Halton Arp included it in his 1966 Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies . In 1971 , Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky described it as a blue post-eruptive galaxy , compact patchy core , spiral plumes , long blue jet SSW . In the De Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies , NGC 1614 has a galaxy morphological classification of SB ( s ) c pec . The SB indicates this is a barred spiral galaxy , while the ' ( s ) ' means it lacks a ring-like structure around the nucleus . The trailing ' c ' describes the spiral arm structure as being loosely wound . The peculiar nature of the galaxy is noted with the 'pec . ' abbreviation . The galaxy is bright at the center , with two nearly symmetrical inner spiral arms .",
  "/wiki/NGC_6946": "NGC 6946 also known as the Fireworks Galaxy is a face-on intermediate spiral galaxy with a small bright nucleus , whose location in the sky straddles the boundary between the northern constellations of Cepheus and Cygnus . Its distance from Earth is about 25.2 million light-years or 7.72 megaparsecs , similar to the distance of M101 ( NGC 5457 ) in the constellation Ursa Major . Both were once considered to be part of the Local Group . but are now known to be among the dozen bright spiral galaxies near the Milky Way but beyond the confines of the Local Group . NGC 6946 lies within the Virgo Supercluster . Discovered by William Herschel on 9 September 1798 , this well-studied galaxy has a diameter of approximately 40,000 light-years , about one-third of the Milky Way 's size , and it contains roughly half the number of stars as the Milky Way . The galaxy is heavily obscured by interstellar matter as it lies quite close to the galactic plane of the Milky Way . Due to its prodigious star formation it has been classified as an active starburst galaxy . Various unusual celestial objects have been observed within NGC 6964 . This includes the so-called 'Red Ellipse ' along one of the northern arms that looks like a super-bubble or very large supernova remnant , and which may have been formed by an open cluster containing massive stars . There are also two regions of unusual dark lanes of nebulosity , while within the spiral arms several regions appear devoid of stars and gaseous hydrogen , some spanning up to two kiloparsecs across . A third peculiar object , discovered in 1967 , is now known as Hodge 's Complex .",
  "/wiki/Baby_Boom_Galaxy": "The Baby Boom Galaxy is a starburst galaxy located 12.2 billion light years away . Discovered by NASA 's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , the galaxy is the record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe , with brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate . The Baby Boom Galaxy has been nicknamed the extreme stellar machine because it is seen producing stars at a rate of up to 4,000 per year ( one star every 2.2 hours ) . The Milky Way galaxy in which Earth resides turns out an average of just 10 stars per year .",
  "/wiki/Centaurus_A": "Centaurus A or NGC 5128 is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus . It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta , in New South Wales , Australia . There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy 's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type ( lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy ) and distance ( 10-16 million light-years ) . NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth , so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers . The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky , making it an ideal amateur astronomy target , although the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere . The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 55 million solar masses , which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths . By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade , astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light . X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles . The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long , while the radio jets are over a million light-years long . Like other starburst galaxies , a collision is suspected to be responsible for the intense burst of star formation . Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided and merged with a smaller spiral galaxy .",
  "/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy": "An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth , nearly featureless image . They are one of the three main classes of galaxy described by Edwin Hubble in his Hubble sequence and 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae , along with spiral and lenticular galaxies . Elliptical ( E ) galaxies are , together with lenticular galaxies ( S0 ) with their large-scale disks , and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks , a subset of the early-type galaxy population . Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older , low-mass stars , with a sparse interstellar medium and minimal star formation activity , and they tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters . Elliptical galaxies are believed to make up approximately 10-15% of galaxies in the Virgo Supercluster , and they are not the dominant type of galaxy in the universe overall . They are preferentially found close to the centers of galaxy clusters . Elliptical galaxies range in size from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars . Originally , Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies , which was later discovered to be false , although the accretion of gas and smaller galaxies may build a disk around a pre-existing ellipsoidal structure . Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are on average much older than stars found in spiral galaxies . Centaurus A ( NGC 5128 ) , a radio galaxy , elliptical/lenticular disputed .",

Visually , it appears to be an irregular galaxy , as the ESO image to the right shows . H11 is named after Guillermo Haro , a Mexican astronomer who first included it in a study published in 1956 about blue galaxies . H11 is a starburst galaxy that has 'super star clusters ' within it and is one of nine galaxies in the local universe known to emit Lyman Continuum photons ( LyC ) .",
  "/wiki/Lyman_continuum_photons": "Lyman continuum photons ( abbrev . LyC ) , shortened to Ly continuum photons or Lyc photon , are the photons emitted from stars at photon energies above the Lyman limit . Hydrogen is ionized by absorbing LyC . Working from Victor Schumann 's discovery of ultraviolet light , from 1906 to 1914 , Theodore Lyman observed that atomic hydrogen absorbs light only at specific frequencies ( or wavelengths ) and the Lyman series is thus named after him . All the wavelengths in the Lyman series are in the ultraviolet band . This quantized absorption behavior occurs only up to an energy limit , known as the ionization energy . In the case of neutral atomic hydrogen , the minimum ionization energy is equal to the Lyman limit , where the photon has enough energy to completely ionize the atom , resulting in a free proton and a free electron . Above this energy ( below this wavelength ) , all wavelengths of light may be absorbed . This forms a continuum in the energy spectrum ; the spectrum is continuous rather than composed of many discrete lines , which are seen at lower energies . The Lyman limit is at the wavelength of 91.2 nm ( 912 \u00c5 ) , corresponding to a frequency of 3.29 million GHz and a photon energy of 13.6 eV . LyC energies are mostly in the ultraviolet C portion of the electromagnetic spectrum ( see Lyman series ) . Although X-rays and gamma-rays will also ionize a hydrogen atom , there are far fewer of them emitted from a star 's photosphere - LyC are predominantly UV-C .",
  "/wiki/Sculptor_Galaxy": "The Sculptor Galaxy , also known as the Silver Coin or Silver Dollar Galaxy , NGC 253 , is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor . The Sculptor Galaxy is a starburst galaxy , which means that it is currently undergoing a period of intense star formation ."
