The film is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019 , in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies . When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by Roy Batty ( Hauer ) escapes back to Earth , burnt-out cop Rick Deckard ( Ford ) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down . Blade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics ; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals , while others were displeased with its slow pacing and lack of action . It later became an acclaimed cult film regarded as one of the all-time best science fiction films . Hailed for its production design depicting a retrofitted future , Blade Runner is a leading example of neo-noir cinema . The film 's soundtrack , composed by Vangelis , was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score . The film has influenced many science fiction films , video games , anime , and television series . It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood , and several later big-budget films were based on his work . In the year after its release , Blade Runner won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , and in 1993 it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant .",
