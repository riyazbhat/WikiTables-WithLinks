  "/wiki/British_Columbia": "British Columbia ( BC ; French : Colombie-Britannique ) is the westernmost province in Canada , located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains . With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies . The largest city is Vancouver , the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada , the largest in Western Canada , and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest .",

The stadium opened on June 19 , 1983 , and was built as an indoor structure with an air-supported roof , the largest of its kind in the world upon its opening . Following the 2010 Winter Olympics , BC Place was closed for 16 months as part of an extensive revitalization , the centrepiece of which was replacing the inflatable roof with a retractable roof supported by cables . Once construction was completed , the stadium 's new roof was also the largest of its type ."
