  "/wiki/Erich_Hoffmann": "Erich Hoffmann ( April 25 , 1868 - May 8 , 1959 ) was a German dermatologist who was a native of Witzmitz , Pomerania . He studied medicine at the Berlin Military Academy , and was later a professor at the Universities of Halle and Bonn . Hoffmann is remembered for his research performed with zoologist Fritz Schaudinn ( 1871-1906 ) at the Charit\u00e9 Clinic in Berlin . In 1905 Schaudinn and Hoffmann discovered the bacterium that was responsible for syphilis , a spiral-shaped spirochete called Treponema pallidum . The organism was removed from a papula in the vulva of a patient with secondary syphilis . The two doctors documented their findings in a treatise called Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillome . Hoffmann left Germany during the era of National Socialism , but returned to Bonn after the war and established a laboratory . In the late 1940s he published two books about his life in medicine , titled Wollen und Schaffen and Ringen um Vollendung .",

  "/wiki/German_National_People's_Party": "The German National People 's Party ( , DNVP ) was a national-conservative party in Germany during the time of the Weimar Republic . Before the rise of the Nazi Party , it was the major conservative and nationalist party in Weimar Germany . It was an alliance of nationalists , reactionary monarchists , v\u00f6lkisch and antisemitic elements supported by the Pan-German League . It was formed in late 1918 after Germany 's defeat in World War I and the November Revolution that toppled the German monarchy . It combined the bulk of the German Conservative Party , Free Conservative Party and German Fatherland Party with right-wing elements of the National Liberal Party . The party strongly rejected the republican Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles which it viewed as a national disgrace , signed by traitors . The party instead aimed at a restoration of monarchy , a repeal of the dictated peace treaty and reacquisition of all lost territories and colonies . During the mid-1920s , the DNVP moderated its profile , accepting republican institutions in practice ( while still calling for a return to monarchy in its manifesto ) and participating in centre-right coalition governments on federal and state levels . It broadened its voting base - winning as many as 20.5% in the December 1924 election - and supported the election of Paul von Hindenburg as President of Germany ( Reichspr\u00e4sident ) in 1925 . Under the leadership of the populist media entrepreneur Alfred Hugenberg from 1928 , the party reclaimed its reactionary nationalist and anti-republican rhetoric and changed its strategy to mass mobilisation , plebiscites and support of authoritarian rule by the President instead of work by parliamentary means . At the same time , it lost many votes to Adolf Hitler 's rising Nazi Party . Several prominent Nazis began their careers in the DNVP .",
  "/wiki/Herbert_Backe": "Herbert Friedrich Wilhelm Backe ( 1 May 1896 - 6 April 1947 ) was a German politician and SS functionary during the Nazi era . He was a doctrinaire racial ideologue , a long-time associate of Richard Walther Darr\u00e9 and a personal friend of Reinhard Heydrich . He developed and implemented the Hunger Plan that envisioned death by starvation of millions of Slavic and Jewish useless eaters following Operation Barbarossa , the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union . This plan was developed during the planning phase for the Wehrmacht ( German Armed Forces ) invasion and provided for diverting of the Ukrainian food stuffs away from central and northern Russia and redirecting them for the benefit of the invading army and the population in Germany . As a result , millions of civilians died in the German-occupied territories . Arrested in 1945 and due to be tried for war crimes at Nuremberg in the Ministries Trial , he committed suicide in prison in 1947 .",
  "/wiki/Nazi_Party": "The National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( , abbreviated NSDAP ) , commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party ( ) , was a far-right political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 , that created and supported the ideology of National Socialism . Its precursor , the German Workers ' Party ( Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ; DAP ) , existed from 1919 to 1920 . The Nazi Party emerged from the German nationalist , racist and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture , which fought against the communist uprisings in post-World War I Germany . The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into v\u00f6lkisch nationalism . Initially , Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business , anti-bourgeois , and anti-capitalist rhetoric , although this was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders , and in the 1930s the party 's main focus shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes . Pseudo-scientific racist theories were central to Nazism , expressed in the idea of a people 's community ( Volksgemeinschaft ) . The party aimed to unite racially desirable Germans as national comrades , while excluding those deemed either to be political dissidents , physically or intellectually inferior , or of a foreign race ( Fremdv\u00f6lkische ) . The Nazis sought to strengthen the Germanic people , the Aryan master race , through racial purity and eugenics , broad social welfare programs , and a collective subordination of individual rights , which could be sacrificed for the good of the state on behalf of the people . To protect the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race , the Nazis sought to exterminate Jews , Romani , Poles and most other Slavs , along with the physically and mentally handicapped . They disenfranchised and segregated homosexuals , Africans , Jehovah 's Witnesses and political opponents . The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state set in motion the Final Solution-an industrial system of genocide which achieved the murder of around 6 million Jews and millions of other targeted victims , in what has become known as the Holocaust . Adolf Hitler , the party 's leader since 1921 , was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933 .",
