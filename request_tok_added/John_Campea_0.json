  "/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_(film)": "The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk , produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures .

It stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner , alongside Liv Tyler , Tim Roth , Tim Blake Nelson , Ty Burrell , and William Hurt . In The Incredible Hulk , Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the Super-Soldier program through gamma radiation . On the run , he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General Thaddeus Ross , but his worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a similar , but more bestial creature . After the mixed reception to the 2003 film Hulk , Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character . Leterrier , who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man , was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name . In April 2007 , Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn 's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity as a reboot , although he would go uncredited for his writing . Filming mostly took place in Toronto , Ontario , from July to November 2007 . Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to complete the film .
