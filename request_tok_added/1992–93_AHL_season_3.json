  "/wiki/Capital_District_Islanders": "The Capital District Islanders were a team in the American Hockey League based in Troy , New York , which is located within a region popularly called the Capital District . The Islanders were the principal minor league affiliate of the National Hockey League 's New York Islanders during the 1990-91 , 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons . The Islanders were born out of an effort to coax an AHL team into Albany 's newly built Knickerbocker Arena . However , the Adirondack Red Wings , based in Glens Falls , had long claimed the Capital District as part of its home territory , and initially refused to allow an AHL expansion team to play in Albany . Those plans changed when the International Hockey League expanded eastward out of its Great Lakes stronghold to move the Fort Wayne Komets to Knickerbocker Arena as the Albany Choppers . By this time , the IHL had firmly established itself as the AHL 's equal , and the AHL was unnerved by this encroachment into its Northeastern heartland . It sought to sabotage the Choppers by locating another team in the Albany area . It hastily granted an expansion team to a group headed by one of the suitors for an Albany AHL franchise , car dealer Michael Cantanucci . The new team would play at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 's Houston Field House on its Troy campus . It quickly secured an affiliation with the NHL Islanders , bringing with them most of the players who had been on the Calder Cup champion Springfield Indians the previous year . In the ensuing price and attendance wars , the Choppers folded midseason . The Islanders ' best record was in the 1993 season , when the team finished 34-34-12 for 3rd place in its division and a playoff berth .",
