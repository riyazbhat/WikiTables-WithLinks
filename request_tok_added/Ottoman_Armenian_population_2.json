  "/wiki/Subdivisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire": "The administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire were administrative divisions of the state organisation of the Ottoman Empire . Outside this system were various types of vassal and tributary states . The Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces , in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan , in the late 14th century . The beylerbey , or governor , of each province was appointed by the central government . Sanjaks were governed by sanjak-beys , selected from the high military ranks by the central government . Beylerbeyis had authority over all the sancakbeyis in a region . Kaza was a subdivision of sancak and referred to the basic administrative district , governed by a kadi . It is considered extremely difficult to define the number and exact borders of Ottoman provinces and domains , as their borders were changed constantly . Until the Tanzimat period , the borders of administrative units fluctuated , reflecting the changing strategies of the Ottomans , the emergence of new threats in the region , and the rise of powerful Ayans . All the subdivisions were very unequal in regard of area and population , and the presence of numerous nomadic tribes contributed to the extreme variability of the population figures .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

The governorates are divided into sixty districts ( man\u0101\u1e6diq , singular min\u1e6daqah ) , which are further divided into subdistricts ( naw\u0101\u1e25\u012b , singular n\u0101\u1e25iyah ) .

East Thrace is of historic importance as it is next to a major sea-based trade corridor and constitutes what remains of the once-vast Ottoman region of Rumelia . It is currently also of specific geostrategic importance because the sea corridor , which includes two narrow straits , provides access to the Mediterranean Sea from the Black Sea for the navies of five countries : Russia , Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , and Georgia .

  "/wiki/Mutasarrifate_of_Jerusalem": "The Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem ( , ; , ) , also known as the Sanjak of Jerusalem , was an Ottoman district with special administrative status established in 1872 . The district encompassed Jerusalem as well as Bethlehem , Hebron , Jaffa , Gaza and Beersheba . During the late Ottoman period , the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem , together with the Sanjak of Nablus and Sanjak of Akka ( Acre ) , formed the region that was commonly referred to as Palestine . It was the 7th most heavily populated region of the Ottoman Empire 's 36 provinces . The district was separated from Damascus and placed directly under the Ottoman central government in Constantinople ( now Istanbul in English ) in 1841 , and formally created as an independent province in 1872 by Grand Vizier Mahmud Nedim Pasha . Scholars provide a variety of reasons for the separation , including increased European interest in the region , and strengthening of the southern border of the Empire against the Khedivate of Egypt . Initially , the Mutasarrifate of Acre and Mutasarrifate of Nablus were combined with the province of Jerusalem , with the combined province being referred to in the register of the court of Jerusalem as the Jerusalem Eyalet , and referred to by the British consul as creation of Palestine into a separate eyalet . However , after less than two months , the sanjaks of Nablus and Acre were separated and added to the Vilayet of Beirut , leaving just the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem . In 1906 , the Kaza of Nazareth was added to the Jerusalem Mutasarrifate , as an exclave , primarily in order to allow the issuance of a single tourist permit to Christian travellers . The area was conquered by the Allied Forces in 1917 during World War I and a military Occupied Enemy Territory Administration ( OETA South ) set up to replace the Ottoman administration . OETA South consisted of the Ottoman sanjaks of Jerusalem , Nablus and Acre . The military administration was replaced by a British civilian administration in 1920 and the area of OETA South was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine in 1923 .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires ."
