  "/wiki/Hot_Lotto_fraud_scandal": "The Hot Lotto fraud scandal broke in 2017 , after Eddie Raymond Tipton , the former information security director of the Multi-State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) , confessed to rigging a random number generator that he and two others used in multiple cases of fraud against state lotteries . Tipton was first convicted in October 2015 of rigging a $ 14.3 million drawing of MUSL 's lottery game Hot Lotto . Eddie Tipton ultimately confessed to rigging lottery drawings in Iowa , Colorado , Wisconsin , Kansas and Oklahoma . Also involved in the scheme were his brother and former Texas Justice of the Peace Tommy Tipton , and Texas businessman Robert Rhodes . Eddie Tipton was sentenced to 25 years in prison . A $ 14.3 million prize for the Hot Lotto draw on December 29 , 2010 had been left unclaimed for nearly a year , when attempts were made to claim the prize on behalf of an anonymous , off-shore trust company in Belize . The claim was rejected by the Iowa Lottery because it was made anonymously . A subsequent investigation into the trust and the discovery of surveillance footage from a convenience store that allegedly depicted the ticket being purchased , led to the arrest of Eddie Tipton on two counts of fraud for attempting to illegally participate in a lottery game as an employee of the MUSL , and then trying to claim a prize through fraudulent means . When his trial began on April 13 , 2015 , evidence was introduced by the prosecutors to support allegations that Tipton had rigged the draw in question , by using his privileged access to an MUSL facility to install a rootkit on the computer containing Hot Lotto 's random number generator , and then attempting to claim a winning ticket with the rigged numbers anonymously . On July 20 , 2015 , Tipton was found guilty on both counts ; he was sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment , pending an appeal . Eddie Tipton and his brother Tommy Boyd Tipton were subsequently accused of rigging other lottery drawings , dating back as far as 2005 . Based on forensic examination of the random number generator that had been used in a 2007 Wisconsin lottery incident , investigators discovered that Eddie Tipton programmed a lottery random number generator to produce special results if the lottery numbers were drawn on certain days of the year .",
  "/wiki/Triple_Six_Fix": "The 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal , colloquially known as the Triple Six Fix , was a successful plot to rig The Daily Number , a three-digit game of the Pennsylvania Lottery . All of the balls in the three machines , except those numbered 4 and 6 , were weighted , meaning that the drawing was almost sure to be a combination of those digits . The scheme was successful in that 666 ( one of the eight combinations of 4s and 6s that the fixers were hoping for ) was drawn on April 24 , 1980 ; however , the unusual betting patterns alerted authorities to the crime . The chief conspirators were sent to prison , and most of the fraudulently acquired winnings were never paid out .",

  "/wiki/Love_Canal": "Love Canal was a neighborhood in Niagara Falls , New York . The neighborhood is known infamously as the location of a landfill which became the cause of a massive environmental pollution disaster harming the health of hundreds of residents , culminating in an extensive Superfund cleanup operation . In 1890 , Love Canal was envisioned to be a model planned community . After the partial development and subsequent demise of the project , the canal became a dump site during the 1920s for municipal refuse for the City of Niagara Falls . During the 1940s , the canal was purchased by Hooker Chemical Company , now Occidental Chemical Corporation , which used the site to dump 21,800 short tons of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes , perfumes , and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins . After its sale to the local school district in 1953 , which occurred using the threat of eminent domain , Love Canal attracted national attention for the public health problem originating from the former massive dumping of toxic waste on the grounds . This event displaced numerous families , leaving them with long-standing health issues and symptoms of high white blood cell counts and leukemia . Subsequently , the federal government passed the Superfund law . The resulting Superfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood , ending during 2004 . The New York State Department of Health Commissioner at the time , David Axelrod , termed the Love Canal incident a national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations . The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around . The University at Buffalo University Archives houses a number of primary documents , photographs , and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal environmental disaster ; many items have been digitized and are viewable online .",

Wells was killed when an explosive collar detonated while he was surrounded by police in his hometown of Erie , Pennsylvania . The collar had been forcibly locked onto his neck as part of the plot . The FBI led a task force investigating the crime , in conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives and the Pennsylvania State Police .

A federal grand jury indicted Wellss co-conspirators , Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes , on charges of bank robbery , conspiracy , and weapons charges , while other co-conspirators had died .

  "/wiki/Horse_murders": "The horse murders scandal refers to cases of insurance fraud in the United States in which expensive horses , many of them show jumpers , were insured against death , accident , or disease , and then killed to collect the insurance money . It is not known how many horses were killed in this manner between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s , when a Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) investigation brought the horse killings to light , but the number is thought to be well over 50 , and may have been as high as 100 . In addition , in 1977 , the heiress Helen Brach disappeared and was presumed by law enforcement agents to have been murdered by the perpetrators of these crimes , because she threatened to report their criminal activity to authorities ; continuing investigations into Brach 's death began to uncover the insurance fraud in the 1990s . The scandal has been called one of the biggest , most gruesome stories in sports as well as the biggest scandal in the history of equestrian sports . Thirty-six people were indicted and tried for insurance fraud , mail and wire fraud , obstruction of justice , extortion , racketeering , and animal cruelty in connection with the horse murders ; 35 were convicted . Of the 23 people indicted in Chicago in July 1994 , 20 pleaded guilty . The disappearance and murder of Helen Brach was never fully solved , although one man , Richard Bailey , is serving life in prison for soliciting her murder . Over the 20-year period during which the horse murders took place , several different motivations led horse owners and trainers , often affluent and well-respected people , to become involved in what ultimately became a widespread conspiracy . In some cases , the owner of a promising , or even prize-winning , horse was temporarily strapped for cash and decided to insure and then kill the animal ; this was the situation in the 1982 murder of the show jumper Henry the Hawk . Sometimes people bought over-valued horses . Rather than take a loss on a poor investment , these owners chose to finance their next horse purchase by defrauding the insurance company that had insured the unwanted horse . Another aspect to the scandal went beyond insurance fraud and involved racketeering ."
