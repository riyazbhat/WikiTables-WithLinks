  "/wiki/SAS_Institute": "The Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) began as a project at North Carolina State University 's agricultural department . It was originally led by Anthony James Barr in 1966 , then joined by NCSU graduate student James Goodnight in 1967 and John Sall in 1973 . In the early 1970s , the software was primarily leased to other agricultural departments in order to analyze the effect soil , weather and seed varieties had on crop yields . The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health and later by a coalition of university statistics programs called the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations . By 1976 the software had 100 customers and 300 people attended the first SAS user conference in Kissimmee , Florida that year . Goodnight , Barr , Sall and another early participant , Jane Helwig , founded SAS Institute Inc. as a private company on July 1 , 1976 , in offices across the street from the university . Barr and Helwig later sold their interest in the company . SAS ' tradition of polling users for suggestions to improve the software through the SASWare Ballot was adopted during its first year of operation . Many of the company 's employee perks , such as fresh fruit , reasonable work hours and free M & M 's every Wednesday became part of the company 's practices that first year . In the late 1970s , the company established its first marketing department . SAS started building its current headquarters in a forested area of Cary , North Carolina in 1980 . Later that year it started providing on-site daycare in order to keep an employee who was planning on being a stay-at-home mom .",

The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan , New York City , but is incorporated in Delaware . In 1984 , the United States Department of Justice mandated AT & T Corporation to break up the Bell System and split into seven companies , each a Regional Bell Operating Company ( RBOC ) , and commonly referred to as Baby Bells . One of the Baby Bells , Bell Atlantic , came into existence in 1984 , consisting of the separate operating companies New Jersey Bell , Bell of Pennsylvania , Diamond State Telephone , and C & P Telephone , with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia . This company would later become Verizon . As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s , all of Bell Atlantic 's operating companies assumed the holding company 's name . In 1997 , Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX . Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company name , the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX 's old headquarters in New York City . In 2000 , Bell Atlantic acquired GTE , which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic 's footprint . Bell Atlantic , the surviving entity , changed its name to Verizon , a portmanteau of veritas ( Latin for truth ) and horizon . In 2015 , Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL , and two years later it acquired Yahoo ! . AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc. ( currently known as Verizon Media ) .",
