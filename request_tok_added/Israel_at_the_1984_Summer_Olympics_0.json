The event took place between 3 and 6 August . With four notable front runners in the race the battle to the break was important . Edwin Koech on the far outside and Joaquim Cruz went out hard around the first turn , with Earl Jones and Johnny Gray to the inside . Cruz , Jones and Gray converged at the same spot , Gray getting the short end of the stick and suddenly losing ground to the back of the field , then Koech converged from the outside , closing the door on Cruz and Jones , with Cruz edging ahead of Jones as contact was made causing Cruz to jump 200 metres into the race . The lead group was marked by British rivals , defending champion Steve Ovett and world record holder Sebastian Coe . They held that order through the next 200 metres , only upset by Gray long striding along the outside up to Coe 's shoulder . Gray 's added speed seemed to force the leaders to run faster to stay ahead of him , while Ovett withered out the back of the field . With 200 to go Gray seemed to tighten up , frustrated that his hard effort only netted him fifth place . Through the turn , Cruz inched closer to Koech , still marked by Coe and Jones . When Cruz pounced coming off the turn , Koech wilted , outside of him Coe and Jones were in a shoulder to shoulder sprint battle . Cruz had won the war , sprinting away to a clear 5 metre victory .",

Shortly after the second lap began , Peter Renner assumed the lead , followed by Kenyan Julius duo of Julius Korir and Julius Kariuki . Henry Marsh was typically as much as 20 metres back off the pace . Renner opened up several metres on the Kenyans but with two laps to go , the field began bunching behind Renner with Brian Diemer , Joseph Mahmoud , Colin Reitz and Marsh back in the fold , all getting ready to pounce . Just before the bell , Renner started to fall back . Korir accelerated and Marsh was the first to follow , Diemer was next to catch up , followed by Mahmoud .

Marsh was unable to make any headway as Mahmoud passed in on the outside , with Korir taking the final barrier as a hurdler and sprinting to victory . Mahmoud sprinted away to the silver medal while Diemer challenged Marsh on the outside .",
