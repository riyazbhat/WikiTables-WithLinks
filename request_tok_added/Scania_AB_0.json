  "/wiki/World_Manufacturer_Identifier": "A vehicle identification number ( VIN ) is a unique code , including a serial number , used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles , towed vehicles , motorcycles , scooters and mopeds , as defined in ISO 3779 ( content and structure ) and ISO 4030 ( location and attachment ) . VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States . From 1954 to 1981 , there was no accepted standard for these numbers , so different manufacturers used different formats . In 1954 , at the request of the US government , the US auto manufacturers and the Automobile Manufacturers Association were involved in the creation of the new , standardized vehicle identification numbering system named the Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) with an agreed upon digit sequence and concealed chassis markings of this VIN . Up to that time , states used the engine number to register and title cars and trucks which became a problem if the engine was replaced which was fairly common at the time . In 1981 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format . It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN , which does not include the letters O ( o ) , I ( i ) , and Q ( q ) ( to avoid confusion with numerals 0 , 1 , and 9 ) . There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off .",
  "/wiki/Continent": "A continent is one of several very large landmasses . Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria , up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents . Ordered from largest in area to smallest , they are : Asia , Africa , North America , South America , Antarctica , Europe , and Australia . Geologically , the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates . However , some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents . Zealandia is one such area ( see submerged continents below ) . This type of landmass is only known to exist on Earth . Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world 's land into geopolitical regions . Under this scheme , most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania .",

  "/wiki/Axle": "An axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear . On wheeled vehicles , the axle may be fixed to the wheels , rotating with them , or fixed to the vehicle , with the wheels rotating around the axle . In the former case , bearings or bushings are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported . In the latter case , a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle . Sometimes , especially on bicycles , the latter type axle is referred to as a spindle .",
  "/wiki/Gear": "A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth or , in the case of a cogwheel , inserted teeth ( called cogs ) , which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque . Geared devices can change the speed , torque , and direction of a power source . Gears almost always produce a change in torque , creating a mechanical advantage , through their gear ratio , and thus may be considered a simple machine . The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape . Two or more meshing gears , working in a sequence , are called a gear train or a transmission . A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part , called a rack , producing translation instead of rotation . The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed , belt pulley system . An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage . When two gears mesh , if one gear is bigger than the other , a mechanical advantage is produced , with the rotational speeds , and the torques , of the two gears differing in proportion to their diameters . In transmissions with multiple gear ratios - such as bicycles , motorcycles , and cars - the term gear as in first gear refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear . The term describes similar devices , even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete , or when the device does not actually contain gears , as in a continuously variable transmission .",
