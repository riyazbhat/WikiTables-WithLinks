  "/wiki/Tilting_at_windmills": "The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha ( Modern Spanish : ( in Part 2 , cavallero ) , ) , or just ( , , ) , is a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes . Published in two parts , in 1605 and 1615 , Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon . A founding work of Western literature , it is often labeled the first modern novel and is sometimes considered the best literary work ever written . The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble ( hidalgo ) from La Mancha named Alonso Quixano , who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant ( caballero andante ) to revive chivalry and serve his nation , under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha . He recruits a simple farmer , Sancho Panza , as his squire , who often employs a unique , earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote 's rhetorical monologues on knighthood , already considered old-fashioned at the time . Don Quixote , in the first part of the book , does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story . The book had a major influence on the literary community , as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas ' The Three Musketeers ( 1844 ) , Mark Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) , and Edmond Rostand 's Cyrano de Bergerac ( 1897 ) , as well as the word quixotic and the epithet Lothario ; the latter refers to a character in El curioso impertinente ( The Impertinently Curious Man ) , an intercalated story that appears in Part One , chapters 33-35 . The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer cited Don Quixote as one of the four greatest novels ever written , along with Tristram Shandy , La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse , and Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre . When first published , Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel . After the French Revolution , it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting . In the 19th century , it was seen as a social commentary , but no one could easily tell whose side Cervantes was on . Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote 's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane , and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality .",

Comprised by the provinces of Albacete , Ciudad Real , Cuenca , Guadalajara and Toledo , it was created in 1982 . It is bordered by Castile and Le\u00f3n , Madrid , Aragon , Valencia , Murcia , Andalusia , and Extremadura . It is one of the most sparsely populated of Spain 's regions . Albacete is the largest and most populous city . The Government headquarters are in Toledo and the High Court headquarters are in Albacete . Castilla-La Mancha was formerly grouped with the province of Madrid into New Castile ( Castilla la Nueva ) , but with the advent of the modern Spanish system of autonomous communities ( Estado de las autonom\u00edas ) , it was separated due to great demographic disparity between the capital and the remaining New-Castilian provinces . Also , distinct from the former New Castile , Castilla-La Mancha added the province of Albacete , which had been part of Murcia ; adding Albacete placed all of the historic region of La Mancha within this single region . It is mostly in this region where the story of the famous Spanish novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes is situated , due to which La Mancha is internationally well-known . Although La Mancha is a windswept , battered plateau , it remains a symbol of Spanish culture with its vineyards , sunflowers , mushrooms , olive plantations , windmills , Manchego cheese , and Don Quixote .",

Located in the northwest Iberian Peninsula , it includes the provinces of A Coru\u00f1a , Lugo , Ourense and Pontevedra . Galicia is bordered by Portugal to the south , the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n and Asturias to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Cantabrian Sea to the north . It had a population of 2,701,743 in 2018 and a total area of 29,574 km2 ( 11,419 sq mi ) . Galicia has over 1,660 km ( 1,030 mi ) of coastline , including its offshore islands and islets , among them C\u00edes Islands , Ons , S\u00e1lvora , Cortegada , and the largest and most populated , A Illa de Arousa . The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period , and takes its name from the Gallaeci , the Celtic people living north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC . Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC , and was made a Roman province in the 3rd century AD . In 410 , the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga ( Portugal ) ; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585 . In 711 , the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the Visigoth kingdom of Hispania by 718 , but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740 . During the Middle Ages , the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings , but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture . From the 13th century on , the kings of Castile , as kings of Galicia , appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r , whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century . The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia , a royal tribunal and government body .",

It includes the Basque provinces of \u00c1lava , Biscay , and Gipuzkoa . The Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was granted the status of nationality within Spain , attributed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 . The autonomous community is based on the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country , a foundational legal document providing the framework for the development of the Basque people on Spanish soil . Navarre , which had narrowly rejected a joint statute of autonomy with Gipuzkoa , \u00c1lava and Biscay in 1932 , was granted a separate statute in 1982 . Currently there is no official capital in the autonomous community , but the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz , in the province of \u00c1lava , is the de facto capital as the location of the Basque Parliament , the headquarters of the Basque Government , and the residence of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community ( the Palace of Ajuria Enea ) . The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country has its headquarters in the city of Bilbao .

Gaud\u00ed 's works have a highly individualized , one-of-a-kind style . Most are located in Barcelona , including his main work , the church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia . Gaud\u00ed 's work was influenced by his passions in life : architecture , nature , and religion . He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics , stained glass , wrought ironwork forging and carpentry . He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials , such as trencad\u00eds which used waste ceramic pieces . Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques , Gaud\u00ed became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . His work transcended mainstream Modernisme , culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms . Gaud\u00ed rarely drew detailed plans of his works , instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them .

  "/wiki/Island_hopping": "Island hopping is the crossing of an ocean by a series of shorter journeys between islands , as opposed to a single journey directly to the destination . Oceanic dispersal in biology , where terrestrial species migrate by sea from one landmass to another , is often achieved by rafting on mats of tangled vegetation - the outcome of which is called a rafting event . This process may be facilitated by geographically intermediate islands that break up the migration into a number of shorter steps . Colonization of a series of islands ( or larger land masses ) by a sequential rafting process is sometimes described as island hopping . Such a process appears to have played a role , for example , in the colonization of the Caribbean by mammals of South American origin ( including caviomorphs and monkeys ) .",
