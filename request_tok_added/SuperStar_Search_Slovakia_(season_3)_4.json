His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history . In 1969 , he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife , Yoko Ono . After the Beatles disbanded in 1970 , Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono 's collaborator . Born in Liverpool , Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager . In 1956 , he formed his first band , the Quarrymen , which evolved into the Beatles in 1960 . He was initially the group 's de facto leader , a role gradually ceded to McCartney . Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music , writing , drawings , on film and in interviews . In the mid-1960s , he had two books published : In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works , both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings . Starting with 1967 's All You Need Is Love , his lyrics espoused a pacifist message , and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture . From 1968 to 1972 , Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono , including a trilogy of avant-garde albums , his first solo LP John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band , and the international top 10 singles Give Peace a Chance , Instant Karma ! , Imagine and Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) .
