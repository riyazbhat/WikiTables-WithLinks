Foyt started on the pole position and Bobby Unser won his second Indy 500 . Dan Gurney , one of the founders of All American Racers , who finished second as a driver himself in 1968-1969 , won his first and only Indy 500 as a car owner . Gurney 's Eagle chassis itself scored its third 500 win . On the 174th lap , a huge downpour pelted the Speedway , and officials immediately ended the race , just 26 laps short of the scheduled distance ( 435 miles ) . Bobby Unser was leading the race at the red flag , and was declared the winner . Defending champion Johnny Rutherford was in second place , and pole-sitter A. J. Foyt came home third . Tom Sneva survived a spectacular crash in turn two on lap 125 . His car touched wheels with Eldon Rasmussen , and flipped into the catch fence near the Turn Two Suites . The engine on Sneva 's car ripped off in a huge fire-flash , and the car came to rest upright with Sneva trapped in the cockpit . Sneva miraculously suffered only minor injuries , and walked away from the wreck with assistance from the safety crews . On the morning of the race , the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was ceremoniously designated to the National Register of Historic Places .",

  "/wiki/1976_Indianapolis_500": "The 60th 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway , Indiana on Sunday , May 30 , 1976 . Polesitter Johnny Rutherford took the lead on lap 80 , and was leading when rain halted the race on lap 103 . Two hours later , the race was about to be resumed , but rain fell again . USAC officials called the race at that point , reverted the scoring back to the completion of lap 102 , and Johnny Rutherford was declared the winner . Rutherford famously walked to Victory Lane , his second career Indy 500 triumph , having completed only 255 miles ( 410 km ) , the shortest official race on record . Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to enter the Indianapolis 500 . However , her team was underfunded , and she experienced numerous mechanical and engine problems during the month . While she managed to pass her rookie test , and ran numerous practice laps in multiple cars , she was unable to make an attempt to qualify . She would return with a successful effort a year later in 1977 . Hours after the race , IMS Vice President in charge of the IMS Radio Network and former driver Elmer George ( husband of Mari Hulman George ) was shot and killed during a confrontation . The confrontation was unrelated to the running of the race . In addition , 1976 would be the final Indy 500 for longtime radio anchor Sid Collins .",
  "/wiki/1977_Indianapolis_500": "The 61st International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway , Indiana on Sunday , May 29 , 1977 . Considered one of the most historically significant editions of the Indianapolis 500 , several sidebar stories complemented the unprecedented accomplishment of race winner A. J. Foyt . Foyt became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 four times . As of 2019 , Foyt 's record has been tied by Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears , but still stands as an Indy 500 record . Foyt 's victory is also the last time the winning car ( both chassis and engine ) was built entirely within the United States . The race was sanctioned by USAC , and was part of the 1977 USAC National Championship Trail . After rain-shortened races in three of the past four years ( 1973 , 1975 , 1976 ) , the 1977 race was run the full distance under hot and sunny conditions . Two major stories headlined qualifying . During time trials , Tom Sneva won the pole position with a new track record . He became the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier at the Speedway . On the final day of time trials , Janet Guthrie broke the gender barrier by becoming the first female driver to qualify for the Indy 500 .

  "/wiki/1978_Indianapolis_500": "The 62nd International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway , Indiana on Sunday , May 28 , 1978 . Danny Ongais dominated the early stages of the race but eventually dropped out with a blown engine . Al Unser Sr. dominated the second half , and held a large lead late in the race . However , Unser bent the front wing of his Lola during a pit stop on lap 180 , causing his handling to go away over the final twenty laps . Second place Tom Sneva charged to catch Unser 's crippled Lola but came up 8 seconds short at the finish line - the second-closest finish in Indy history to that point . Unser held off the challenge , and became a three-time winner of the 500 . It was Al Unser 's third Indy victory in the decade of the 1970s , and the fifth of nine overall victories by the Unser family . Al Unser Sr. entered the month having won the 1977 California 500 at Ontario the previous September . Later in the 1978 season , Unser would go on to win the Pocono 500 and the California 500 , sweeping the triple crown of Indy car racing . As of 2019 he is the only driver in history to do so in the same season , and coupled with the win at Ontario in 1977 , set a record by winning four straight 500-mile Indy car races . Second year driver Janet Guthrie finished ninth , and it was later revealed she drove with a broken wrist . It was the highest finish for a female driver in Indy history until Danica Patrick finished in fourth place in 2005 .",
  "/wiki/1979_Indianapolis_500": "The 63rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway , Indiana , on Sunday May 27 , 1979 . Second-year driver Rick Mears took the lead for the final time with 18 laps to go , and won his first of four Indianapolis 500 races . It was also Mears ' first of a record six Indy 500 pole positions . Brothers Al and Bobby Unser combined to lead 174 of the 200 laps , but Al dropped out around the midpoint , and Bobby slipped to 5th place at the finish nursing mechanical issues . It was also Roger Penske 's second Indy 500 victory as a car owner . The race was sanctioned by USAC , and was part of the 1979 USAC National Championship . However , many of the participants entered the race only as a one-off , and instead broke off and took part in the inaugural 1979 SCCA/CART Indy Car Series . It was the beginning of the first open-wheel split . The month of May 1979 was filled with controversy on and off the track . A court injunction was issued after USAC initially denied entries by some teams that were part of the CART series . During time trials , several cars were disqualified due to illegal wastegate exhaust pipes . Qualifying closed with the traditional 33 cars in the field .",

Johnny Rutherford won the pole position , led 118 laps , and won the race by a commanding 29.92 second margin . After failing to finish the race the year before ( with Al Unser behind the wheel ) , Jim Hall 's radical new Chaparral 2K ground effects chassis was a heavy favorite entering the month , and drove a flawless race . Rutherford , the winner in 1974 and 1976 , became the sixth driver to win the Indy 500 three times . Tom Sneva broke an Indy 500 record by becoming the first driver to start last ( 33rd ) and lead the race . Sneva led two times for 16 laps , and finished the race in second position . Sneva likewise became the first driver in Indy history to start last and finish second ( a feat tied by Scott Goodyear in 1992 ) . It was Sneva 's third runner-up finish in four years , matching Bill Holland 's achievement exactly 30 years earlier in 1947 , 1948 and 1950 . Sneva 's efforts were often branded afterwards with a bridesmaid reference , until he would finally go on to win the race in 1983 . The starting lineup featured 10 rookies , a sharp contrast from 1979 , which had only one . For the first time in Indy history , the three drivers that started in the eleventh and final row finished in the top eight - Tom Sneva 2nd , Gary Bettenhausen 3rd , and Tom Bigelow 8th .",

Gordon Johncock , who had previously won the rain-shortened 1973 race , was the winner . Polesitter Rick Mears finished second by a margin of 0.160 seconds , the closest finish in Indy 500 history to that point . In racing circles , the 1982 race is largely considered one of the best 500s in history , although it was marred by the fatal crash of Gordon Smiley during time trials . Johncock and Mears dueled over most of the final 40 laps . Johncock pulled out to a sizeable lead after his final pit stop on lap 184 . But Mears dramatically began closing the gap in the waning laps . Johncock held off Mears on the final lap in a historic victory , as the raucous crowd drowned out the loud roar of the engines . The race is also remembered for a controversial crash at the start triggered by Kevin Cogan , which took out Mario Andretti , damaged the car of A. J. Foyt , and caused the crash of two other cars . Officially the race was part of the 1981-82 USAC season , however , most of the entrants took part in the 1982 CART PPG Indy Car World Series .

The win also represented the record seventh Indy victory that chief mechanic George Bignotti was involved with . In the final twenty laps , three-time winner Al Unser Sr. was leading Tom Sneva . Unser was seeking his record-tying fourth Indy victory . His son , rookie Al Unser Jr. was several laps down , but was running right behind his father . Al Jr. created a firestorm of controversy when it appeared he was blocking Sneva intentionally to aid his father . After several anxious laps , Sneva finally slipped by both Unsers , pulled away , and claimed his long-awaited first and only Indy victory . Rookie Teo Fabi headlined time trials by winning the pole position , and on race day he led the first 23 laps . Fabi 's day was short , however , as he dropped out with a bad fuel gasket . The effort earned him the rookie of the year award . Fabi would go on to win four races during the season and finish second to Al Unser Sr. for the CART championship .",

  "/wiki/Chevrolet": "Chevrolet ( /\u02cc\u0283\u025bvr\u0259\u02c8le\u026a/ SHEV-r\u0259-LAY ) , colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company , is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors ( GM ) . Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3 , 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company . Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2 , 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency . After Durant 's second ousting in 1919 , Alfred Sloan , with his maxim a car for every purse and purpose , would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family , selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford 's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 . Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide . In Oceania , Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special Vehicles , having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck ( HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden , which GM is retiring in 2020 ) . In 2005 , Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe , primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet , a move rooted in General Motors ' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet . With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe , GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand , while GM 's traditional European standard-bearers , Opel of Germany , and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket . However , GM reversed this move in late 2013 , announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe , with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016 . Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states , including Russia . After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea , the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet . In North America , Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles , from subcompact automobiles to medium-duty commercial trucks ."
