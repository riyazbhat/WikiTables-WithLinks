In response to the announcement , O'Brien released a press statement saying that he would not continue as host of The Tonight Show if it was moved to any time after midnight to accommodate The Jay Leno Show . He feared it would ruin the long and rich tradition of The Tonight Show , which had been on after the late local newscasts from the beginning . After two weeks of negotiations , NBC announced that they had paid $ 45 million to buy out O'Brien 's contract , ending both his tenure as host as well as his relationship with NBC after 22 years . Conan O'Brien 's final Tonight Show was broadcast on January 22 , 2010 , with Jay Leno officially resuming his role as host on March 1 , 2010 , immediately following the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics .
