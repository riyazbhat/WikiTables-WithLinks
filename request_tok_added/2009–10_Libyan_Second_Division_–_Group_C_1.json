Sabha Air Base , south of the city , is a Libyan Air Force installation that is home to multiple MiG-25 aircraft . Sabha was where the erstwhile ruler of Libya , Muammar Gaddafi , grew up and received secondary education and where he also later became involved in political activism . After the Libyan Civil War and the resultant instability in the country , Sabha reportedly grew in importance as a slave auctioning town . However , an investigation by the National Commission for Human Rights in Libya ( NCHRL ) revealed that while there was illegal slavery , reports were exaggerated , as slave auctions were rare and not made public . The city was later seized by forces loyal to the Libyan National Army ( LNA ) and its leader Khalifa Haftar in January 2019 .",
