  "/wiki/Mongolia": "Mongolia [ a ] is a landlocked country in East Asia . Its area is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of Outer Mongolia , and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state . It is sandwiched between Russia to the north and China to the south , where it neighbours the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region . Mongolia does not share a border with Kazakhstan , although only 37 kilometres ( 23 mi ) separate them . At 1,564,116 square kilometres ( 603,909 sq mi ) , Mongolia is the 18th-largest and the most sparsely populated sovereign state in the world , with a population of around three million people . It is also the world 's second-largest landlocked country behind Kazakhstan and the largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea . The country contains very little arable land , as much of its area is covered by grassy steppe , with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south . Ulaanbaatar , the capital and largest city , is home to about 45% of the country 's population . Ulaanbaatar also shares the rank of the world 's coldest capital city with Moscow , Ottawa , and Nur-Sultan . Approximately 30% of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic ; horse culture is still integral . The majority of its population are Buddhists . The non-religious population is the second-largest group .",

It borders Denmark to the north , Poland and the Czech Republic to the east , Austria and Switzerland to the south , France to the southwest , and Luxembourg , Belgium , and the Netherlands to the west . Germany includes 16 constituent states , covers an area of 357,386 square kilometres ( 137,988 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With 83 million inhabitants , it is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia , the most populous state lying entirely in Europe , as well as the most populous member state of the European Union . Germany is a very decentralised country . Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country 's busiest airport . Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .",

  "/wiki/Ophisaurus": "Ophisaurus ( from the Greek 'snake-lizard ' ) is a genus of superficially snake-like lizards in the family Anguidae . Although most species have no legs , their head shapes , movable eyelids , and external ear openings identify them as lizards . A few species have very small , stub-like legs near their rear vents . These are vestigial organs , meaning they once served an evolved purpose but are no longer used . They reach lengths of up to , but about two-thirds of this is the tail . Glass lizards feed on insects , spiders , other small reptiles , and young rodents . Their diets are limited by their inability to unhinge their jaws . Some glass lizards give birth to live young but most lay eggs . They are so-named because their tails are easily broken ; like many lizards , they have the ability to deter predation by dropping off part of the tail , which can break into several pieces , like glass . The tail remains mobile , distracting the predator , while the lizard becomes motionless , allowing eventual escape . This serious loss of body mass requires a considerable effort to replace , and can take years to do so . Despite this ability , the new tail is usually smaller than the original .",
  "/wiki/Cenomanian": "The Cenomanian is , in the ICS ' geological timescale the oldest or earliest age of the Late Cretaceous epoch or the lowest stage of the Upper Cretaceous series . An age is a unit of geochronology : it is a unit of time ; the stage is a unit in the stratigraphic column deposited during the corresponding age . Both age and stage bear the same name . As a unit of geologic time measure , the Cenomanian age spans the time between 100.5 \u00b1 0.9 Ma and 93.9 \u00b1 0.8 Ma ( million years ago ) . In the geologic timescale it is preceded by the Albian and is followed by the Turonian . The Upper Cenomanian starts approximately at 95 M.a . The Cenomanian is coeval with the Woodbinian of the regional timescale of the Gulf of Mexico and the early part of the Eaglefordian of the regional timescale of the East Coast of the United States . At the end of the Cenomanian an anoxic event took place , called the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event or the Bonarelli Event , that is associated with a minor extinction event for marine species .",

Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",
  "/wiki/Iguanian": "Iguania is an infraorder of squamate reptiles that includes iguanas , chameleons , agamids , and New World lizards like anoles and phrynosomatids . Using morphological features as a guide to evolutionary relationships , the Iguania are believed to form the sister group to the remainder of the Squamata . However , molecular information has placed Iguania well within the Squamata as sister taxa to the Anguimorpha and closely related to snakes . Iguanians are largely arboreal and usually have primitive fleshy , non-prehensile tongues , although the tongue is highly modified in chameleons .

The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and took its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Fredrick Lugard . The British set up administrative and legal structures while practicing indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms , Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 .
