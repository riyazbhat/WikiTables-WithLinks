  "/wiki/Triturus_dobrogicus": "The Danube crested newt or Danube newt ( Triturus dobrogicus ) is a species of newt found in central and eastern Europe , along the basin of the Danube river and some of its tributaries and in the Dnieper delta . It has a smaller and more slender body than the other crested newts in genus Triturus but like these , males develop a conspicuous jagged seam on back and tail during breeding season . For half of the year or longer , adults live in slow-flowing river margins , lakes , or ponds , where reproduction takes place . Males perform a courtship display , and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of aquatic plants . Larvae develop two to four months in the water before reaching metamorphosis . For the remainder of the year , the newts live in shady land habitats , usually forests . Although not yet considered threatened , Danube crested newt populations have declined significantly , the reason being mainly habitat loss . The species is protected by law in the European Union ."
