The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than can release energy equal to more than . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",
