  "/wiki/1840_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1840 United States presidential election was the 14th quadrennial presidential election , held from Friday , October 30 to Wednesday , December 2 , 1840 . Economic recovery from the Panic of 1837 was incomplete , and Whig nominee William Henry Harrison defeated incumbent President Martin Van Buren of the Democratic Party . The election marked the first of two Whig victories in presidential elections . In 1839 , the Whigs held a national convention for the first time . The 1839 Whig National Convention saw 1836 nominee William Henry Harrison defeat former Secretary of State Henry Clay and General Winfield Scott . Van Buren faced little opposition at the 1840 Democratic National Convention , but controversial Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson was not re-nominated . The Democrats thus became the only major party since the passage of the Twelfth Amendment to fail to select a vice presidential nominee . Referencing vice presidential nominee John Tyler and Harrison 's participation in the Battle of Tippecanoe , the Whigs campaigned on the slogan of Tippecanoe and Tyler Too . With Van Buren weakened by economic woes , Harrison won a popular majority and 234 of 294 electoral votes . Voter participation surged as white manhood suffrage became nearly universal , and a contemporary record of 42.4% of the voting age population voted for Harrison . Van Buren 's loss made him the third president to lose re-election . The Whigs did not enjoy the benefits of victory .",
  "/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison": "William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States in 1841 . He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 . During his early military career , he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers , an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War . Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada . Harrison began his political career in 1798 , when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory , and in 1799 he was elected as the territory 's delegate in the House of Representatives . Two years later , President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory , a post he held until 1812 . After the War of 1812 , he moved to Ohio where he was elected to represent the state 's 1st district in the House in 1816 .",

  "/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election": "In the 1860 United States presidential election was the nineteenth quadrennial presidential election to select the President and Vice President of the United States . The election was held on Tuesday , November 6 , 1860 . In a four-way contest , the Republican Party ticket of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin emerged triumphant . The election of Lincoln served as the primary catalyst of the American Civil War . The United States had become increasingly divided during the 1850s over sectional disagreements , especially regarding the extension of slavery into the territories . Incumbent President James Buchanan , like his predecessor Franklin Pierce , was a northern Democrat with sympathies for the South . During the mid-to-late 1850s , the anti-slavery Republican Party became a major political force in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Supreme Court 's decision in the 1857 case of Dred Scott v. Sandford . By 1860 , the Republican Party had replaced the defunct Whig Party as the major opposition to the Democrats . A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party , which sought to avoid secession by pushing aside the issue of slavery . The 1860 Republican National Convention nominated Lincoln , a moderate former Congressman from Illinois , as its standard-bearer . The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states , but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories . The first 1860 Democratic National Convention adjourned without agreeing on a nominee , but a second convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president .",

Lincoln led the nation through its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis in the American Civil War . He preserved the Union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the U.S. economy . Lincoln was born in poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana . He was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . Congressman from Illinois . In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . He reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new Republican Party and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas . Lincoln ran for President in 1860 , sweeping the North in victory . Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North 's rejection of their right to practice slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union . As the leader of moderate Republicans , Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold , and included Radical Republicans , War Democrats , Copperheads ( anti-war Democrats ) , and irreconcilable secessionists .",
  "/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln": "Abraham Lincoln , the 16th President of the United States , was assassinated by well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth on April 14 , 1865 , while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford 's Theatre in Washington , D.C . Shot in the head as he watched the play , Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am , in the Petersen House opposite the theater . He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated , and Lincoln 's funeral and burial marked an extended period of national mourning . Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government . Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President Andrew Johnson . Beyond Lincoln 's death , the plot failed : Seward was only wounded and Johnson 's would-be attacker lost his nerve . After a dramatic initial escape , Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt . Powell , Herold , Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy .",

The voter turnout rate was one of the highest in the nation 's history . Incumbent President Rutherford B. Hayes did not seek re-election , keeping a promise made during the 1876 campaign . After the longest convention in the party 's history , the divided Republicans chose another Ohioan , Representative James A. Garfield , as their standard-bearer . The Democratic Party chose General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania as their nominee . The dominance of the two major parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party , the Greenback Party , nominated another Civil War general for president , Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver . In a campaign fought mainly over issues of Civil War loyalties , tariffs , and Chinese immigration , Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote . Weaver and two other minor candidates , Neal Dow and John W. Phelps , together made up the remaining percentage . The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won by the Republicans , the second longest winning streak in American history after the Democratic-Republican Party during the period 1800-1824 . In the end , the popular vote totals of the two main candidates were separated by 1,898 votes , the smallest victory in the popular vote ever recorded . In the electoral college , however , Garfield 's victory was decisive ; he won nearly all of the populous Northern states to achieve a majority of 214 electoral votes to 155 for Hancock . Hancock 's sweep of the Southern states was not enough for victory , but it cemented his party 's dominance of the region for generations .",

He is the only sitting member of the United States House of Representatives to be elected to the presidency . Garfield entered politics as a Republican in 1857 . He served as a member of the Ohio State Senate from 1859 to 1861 . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . At the 1880 Republican National Convention , delegates chose Garfield - who had not sought the White House - as a compromise presidential candidate on the 36th ballot . In the 1880 presidential election , Garfield conducted a low-key front porch campaign and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . Garfield 's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments , purging corruption in the Post Office , and appointing a U.S. Supreme Court justice . He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York , starting a fracas that ended with Robertson 's confirmation and Conkling 's resignation from the Senate .",

In a re-match of the 1896 race , Republican President William McKinley defeated his Democratic challenger , William Jennings Bryan . McKinley 's victory made him the first president to win consecutive re-election since Ulysses S. Grant had accomplished the same feat in 1872 . McKinley and Bryan each faced little opposition within their own party . Although some Gold Democrats explored the possibility of a campaign by Admiral George Dewey , Bryan was easily re-nominated at the 1900 Democratic National Convention after Dewey withdrew from the race . McKinley was unanimously re-nominated at the 1900 Republican National Convention . As Vice President Garret Hobart had died in 1899 , the Republican convention chose New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as McKinley 's running mate . The return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the Spanish-American War helped McKinley to score a decisive victory , while Bryan 's anti-imperialist stance and continued support for bimetallism attracted only limited support . McKinley carried most states outside of the Solid South and won 51.6% of the popular vote . The election results were similar to those of 1896 , though McKinley picked up several Western states and Bryan picked up Kentucky . McKinley was assassinated in September 1901 and was succeeded by Roosevelt .",

During his presidency , McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War , raised protective tariffs to promote American industry and kept the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver ( effectively , expansionary monetary policy ) . McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier , beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major . After the war , he settled in Canton , Ohio , where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton . In 1876 , he was elected to Congress , where he became the Republican Party 's expert on the protective tariff , which he promised would bring prosperity . His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial , which together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890 . He was elected governor of Ohio in 1891 and 1893 , steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests . With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna , he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896 amid a deep economic depression . He defeated his Democratic rival William Jennings Bryan after a front porch campaign in which he advocated sound money ( the gold standard unless altered by international agreement ) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity . Rapid economic growth marked McKinley 's presidency . He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act . McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict , but when negotiation failed he led the nation into the Spanish-American War of 1898 .",

He was the third American president to be assassinated , following Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881 . McKinley was elected in 1900 for his second term . He enjoyed meeting the public and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office . Secretary to the President George B. Cortelyou feared that an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music and took it off the schedule twice , but McKinley restored it each time . Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism , a political philosophy adhered to by recent assassins of foreign leaders . He regarded McKinley as a symbol of oppression and was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him . He was unable to get near the President during an earlier visit , but he shot him twice as McKinley reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple . One bullet grazed McKinley ; the other entered his abdomen and was never found . McKinley initially appeared to be recovering , but he took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous , and he died early the next morning ; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him .",

In the first election held after the end of World War I and the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment , Republican Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio defeated Democratic Governor James M. Cox of Ohio . Incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson privately hoped for a third term , but party leaders were unwilling to re-nominate the ailing and unpopular incumbent . Former President Theodore Roosevelt had been the front-runner for the Republican nomination , but he died in 1919 without leaving an obvious heir to his progressive legacy . With both Wilson and Roosevelt out of the running , the major parties turned to little-known dark horse candidates from the state of Ohio , a swing state with a large number of electoral votes . Cox won the 1920 Democratic National Convention on the 44th ballot , defeating William Gibbs McAdoo , A. Mitchell Palmer , and several other candidates . Harding emerged as a compromise candidate between the conservative and progressive wings of the party , and he clinched his nomination on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention . The election was dominated by the American social and political environment in the aftermath of World War I , which was marked by a hostile response to certain aspects of Wilson 's foreign policy and a massive reaction against the reformist zeal of the Progressive Era . The wartime economic boom had collapsed and the country was deep in a recession . Wilson 's advocacy for America 's entry into the League of Nations in the face of a return to non-interventionist opinion challenged his effectiveness as president , and overseas there were wars and revolutions . At home , the year 1919 was marked by major strikes in the meatpacking and steel industries and large-scale race riots in Chicago and other cities . Anarchist attacks on Wall Street produced fears of radicals and terrorists .",

A member of the Republican Party , he was one of the most popular U.S. presidents to that point . After his death , a number of scandals - including Teapot Dome - came to light , as did his extramarital affair with Nan Britton ; each eroded his popular regard . Harding is often rated as one of the worst presidents in historical rankings . Harding lived in rural Ohio all his life , except when political service took him elsewhere . As a young man , he bought The Marion Star and built it into a successful newspaper . In 1899 , he was elected to the Ohio State Senate ; he spent four years there , then was elected lieutenant governor . He was defeated for governor in 1910 , but was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1914 . He ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1920 , and he was considered a long shot until after the convention began . The leading candidates could not gain the needed majority , and the convention deadlocked . Harding 's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the tenth ballot . He conducted a front porch campaign , remaining for the most part in Marion and allowing the people to come to him , and running on a theme of a return to normalcy of the pre-World War I period .",

Roosevelt defeated Republican businessman Wendell Willkie to be reelected for an unprecedented third term in office . Roosevelt did not want to campaign for a third term initially , but was driven by worsening conditions in Europe . He and his allies sought to defuse challenges from other party leaders like James Farley and Vice President John Nance Garner . The 1940 Democratic National Convention re-nominated Roosevelt on the first ballot , while Garner was replaced on the ticket by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace . Willkie , a dark horse candidate , defeated conservative Senator Robert A. Taft and prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey on the sixth presidential ballot of the 1940 Republican National Convention . Roosevelt , acutely aware of strong isolationist and non-interventionism sentiment , promised there would be no involvement in foreign wars if he were re-elected . Willkie , who had not previously run for public office , conducted an energetic campaign and managed to revive Republican strength in areas of the Midwest and Northeast . He criticized perceived incompetence and waste in the New Deal , warned of the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition , and accused Roosevelt of secretly planning to take the country into World War II . Willkie was damaged by his association with big business , as many working class voters blamed corporations and business leaders for a large part of the onset of the Great Depression .",

A member of the Democratic Party , he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century . Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression , implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century . His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II , which ended shortly after he died in office . He is rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , but has also been subject to substantial criticism .

This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the District of Columbia did not . It was the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the 22nd Amendment . It is also the last election where the losing candidate won Ohio . Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower . Kennedy , a U.S .

Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan 's victory , some historians consider the election to be a realigning election that marked the start of the Reagan Era . Carter 's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy , a younger brother of former President John F. Kennedy . Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the Democratic primaries , but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention . The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan , who had previously served as the Governor of California , former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas , Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois , and several other candidates . All of Reagan 's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries , and the 1980 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush . Anderson entered the race as an independent candidate , and convinced former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey , a Democrat , to serve as his running mate . Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending , implementation of supply-side economic policies , and a balanced budget . His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter , the Iran hostage crisis , and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation .

  "/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan": "On March 30 , 1981 , Ronald Reagan , the 40th President of the United States , was shot and wounded by John Hinckley Jr. in Washington , D.C. , as he was returning to his limousine after a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel . Hinckley 's motivation for the attack was to impress actress Jodie Foster , who had played the role of a child prostitute in the 1976 film Taxi Driver . After seeing the film , Hinckley had developed an obsession with Foster . Reagan was seriously wounded by a .22 Long Rifle bullet that ricocheted off the side of the presidential limousine and hit him in the left underarm , breaking a rib , puncturing a lung , and causing serious internal bleeding . Although close to death upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital , Reagan was stabilized in the emergency room , then underwent emergency exploratory surgery . He recovered and was released from the hospital on April 11 . No formal invocation of presidential succession took place , although Secretary of State Alexander Haig stated that he was in control here while Vice President George H. W. Bush , who was in Fort Worth , Texas at the time of the shooting , returned to Washington . Besides Reagan , White House Press Secretary James Brady , Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy , and police officer Thomas Delahanty were also wounded . All three survived , but Brady suffered brain damage and was permanently disabled ; Brady 's death in 2014 was considered a homicide because it was ultimately caused by this injury . A federal judge subpoenaed Foster to testify at Hinckley 's trial , and he was found not guilty by reason of insanity on charges of attempting to assassinate the president . Hinckley remained confined to a psychiatric facility . In January 2015 , federal prosecutors announced that they would not charge Hinckley with Brady 's death , despite the medical examiner 's classification of his death as a homicide .",
