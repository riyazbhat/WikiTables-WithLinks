  "/wiki/This_Ain't_the_Rosedale_Library": "This Ai n't the Rosedale Library was an independent bookstore located in Toronto , Ontario . Located in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood for much of its history , the store moved to Kensington Market in May 2008 , but closed in June 2010 . Its name referred to Rosedale , an affluent neighbourhood of the city . It was a general interest bookstore promoting small press publications , nontraditional and experimental fiction , LGBT literature , graphic novels , countercultural nonfiction and one of the largest selections of contemporary poetry in Canada . Because both owners were passionate about baseball , the store also had a reputation for its especially deep selection of baseball-related books ; as well , the store was known for offering Toronto 's largest selection of underground zines . The store had a longstanding policy of only carrying books that at least one of the owners or employees had personally read , in order to ensure that the store 's values were reflected in its selection of titles . The store was opened in 1979 by Charles Huisken , and Daniel Bazuin became co-owner in 1981 . Originally located on Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis , it moved to its more familiar location near Church and Wellesley by the mid-1980s . The bookstore had a rich history of author visits and readings , ranging from William S. Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson to Alison Bechdel and Sarah Waters . Local luminaries such as Stuart Ross , Joey Comeau , Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha and Marnie Woodrow made regular appearances to read and teach . The bookstore was also part of the McSweeney 's 100 , the small selection of independent bookstores that were approved to sell Dave Eggers ' literary magazine McSweeney 's and his early novels . In 2005 , The Guardian 's Jeremy Mercer named it Canada 's best independent bookstore and the eighth best in the world , calling it a model for how an independent bookstore could survive in the changing retail climate .",

  "/wiki/Derek_McCormack_(writer)": "Derek McCormack ( born June 20 , 1969 ) is a Canadian novelist and short story writer whose work is characterized by its extreme brevity and its humorous , often distinctly queer forms of sexual darkness . Born and raised in Peterborough , Ontario , he currently lives in Toronto . McCormack 's first book , 1996 's Dark Rides , was published by Gutter Press , a small Canadian press founded by Sam Hiyate as part of a mid-1990s boomlet in alternative publishing in Toronto . That first book was edited by Ken Sparling , who left his aggressively minimalist imprint on it and McCormack 's emerging style . The author/editor relationship was reversed in 2005 , when McCormack edited Sparling 's For Those Whom God Has Blessed With Fingers . The subject of positive reviews and other media coverage , McCormack was frequently described at the beginning of his career as being part of a new generation of Canadian writers , most notably in a 1996 feature about him , Evan Solomon , Russell Smith and Andrew Pyper in The Globe and Mail . But unlike Solomon , Smith and Pyper , McCormack never evinced any particular desire for commercial success , and his books stayed short and dark , and were published by a succession of small presses . Though they continued to get positive attention , including a nomination of Wild Mouse for the 1999 City of Toronto Book Award , and the inclusion of The Haunted Hillbilly on The Globe and Mail and Village Voice lists of the best books of the year for 2004 , McCormack is now firmly a niche or cult writer rather than part of mainstream Canadian literary culture . In 2009 , he served on the jury for the Dayne Ogilvie Prize , a literary award for emerging LGBT writers in Canada , selecting Debra Anderson as that year 's prize winner . In the fall of 2011 , McCormack was diagnosed with a cancer in his digestive system , for which he underwent extensive surgery in March 2012 . Numerous figures in Toronto 's arts scene , including musicians Jason Collett , Matthew Barber and Joe Pernice , writers Sheila Heti and Claudia Dey and artists Seth , David Altmejd and Shary Boyle , participated in a series of charity events to fundraise for his medical and living expenses during his surgery and recuperation .
