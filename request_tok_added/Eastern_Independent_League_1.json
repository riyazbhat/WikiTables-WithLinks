Since then , Boston 's suburbs have been moving out further westward , especially after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290 .

It is a postal address assigned to ZIP code 01982 by the Postal Service and is indistinguishable geographically from the town of Hamilton , Essex County , Massachusetts , United States ( ZIP code 01936 ) . This is shown by an absence of South Hamilton on the Massachusetts Secretary of State 's list of all cities and towns in Massachusetts . The designation arose in the 1960s when the Postal Service built a new modern post office in downtown Hamilton with the intention of closing the original post office 2 miles north on the same road . Due to public objection , the original post office was preserved and remains open to this day . To distinguish between the two post offices in an era when the use of ZIP code was not yet mandatory , the new post office was designated the South Hamilton post office . The Postal Service followed through with moving most of their operations , including all delivery operations , to the new post office . Thus almost all mail delivered within the town of Hamilton carries the South Hamilton postal address and the 01982 ZIP code . Only mail destined for P.O . Boxes located within the old post office and a few nearby buildings still carries the Hamilton postal address and the 01936 area code .
