  "/wiki/Juventus_F.C.": "Juventus Football Club ( from Latin : iuvent\u016bs , youth ; Italian pronunciation : [ ju\u02c8v\u025bntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( pronounced [ \u02c8ju\u02d0ve ] ) , is an Italian professional association football club based in Turin , Piedmont . Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students , the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city , the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Nicknamed Vecchia Signora ( the Old Lady ) , the club has won 35 official league titles , 13 Coppa Italia titles and eight Supercoppa Italiana titles , being the record holder for all these competitions ; two Intercontinental Cups , two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , a joint national record of three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup . Consequently , the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio ( FIGC ) ranking [ a ] whilst on the international stage occupies the 5th position in Europe and the eleventh in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies , having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979 , the most for an Italian team and joint second overall . Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus , initially as an athletics club , it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league ( reformulated as Serie A from 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus , with the exception of the 2006-07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923 . [ b ] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club ante litteram in the country , having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value , revenue and profit since the mid-1990s , being listed on the Borsa italiana since 2001 . Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles , and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the 1976-77 UEFA Cup ( first Southern European side to do so ) , the 1983-84 Cup Winners ' Cup and the 1984-85 European Champions ' Cup . With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup , it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies ; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi , becoming in addition the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association . In December 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics ( IFFHS ) , the highest for an Italian club in both . The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters ' groups , which are often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin , it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora , making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo ( anti-parochialism ) and italianit\u00e0 ( Italianness ) . Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards , four of these in consecutive years ( 1982-1985 , an overall record ) , among these the first player representing Serie A , Omar S\u00edvori , as well as Michel Platini and three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi ; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards , with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zin\u00e9dine Zidane , a national record and third and joint second highest overall , respectively , in the cited prizes .",
  "/wiki/Away_goals_rule": "The away goals rule is a method of breaking ties in association football and other sports when teams play each other twice , once at each team 's home ground . By the away goals rule , the team that has scored more goals away from home wins , if the total goals scored by each team are otherwise equal . This is sometimes expressed by saying that away goals count double in the event of a tie . The away goals rule is most often invoked in two-leg fixtures , where the initial result is determined by the aggregate score - i.e . the scores of both games are added together . In many competitions , the away goals rule is the first tie-breaker in such cases , with a penalty shootout as the second tie-breaker if each team has scored the same number of away goals . Rules vary as to whether the away goals rule applies only to the end of normal time of the second leg , or applies in extra time as well . It was first introduced by UEFA in the 1965-66 European Cup Winners ' Cup .",

  "/wiki/Overtime_(sports)": "Overtime or extra time is an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw where the scores are the same . In some sports , this extra period is played only if the game is required to have a clear winner , as in single-elimination tournaments where only one team or players can advance to the next round or win the tournament . In other sports , particularly those prominently played in North America where ties are generally disfavored , some form of overtime is employed for all games . The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions . Some may employ sudden death , where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game . In others , play continues until a specified time has elapsed , and only then is the winner declared . If the contest remains tied after the extra session , depending on the rules , the match may immediately end as a draw , additional periods may be played , or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a penalty shootout may be used instead . The terms overtime and in overtime ( abbreviated OT or IOT ) are primarily used in North America , whereas the terms extra time and after extra time ( abbreviated a.e.t . ) are usually used in other continents . However , in basketball , the terms overtime and in overtime are used worldwide .",

Atalanta also participated in four seasons of the UEFA Europa League ( previously known as UEFA Cup ) , reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990-91 season . The club qualified for the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League , reaching the competition for the first time in their history , as they finished 3rd in the 2018-19 Serie A season . This represented the highest finish in the league in the club 's history .",
  "/wiki/Penalty_shootout_(association_football)": "A penalty shoot-out ( officially kicks from the penalty mark ) is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an association football match that can not end in a draw , when the score is tied after the regulation playing time as well as extra time ( if used ) have expired . In a penalty shoot-out , each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark , with the goal only defended by the opposing team 's goalkeeper . Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers ; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor . Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead . If scores are level after five pairs of shots , the shootout progresses into additional sudden-death rounds . Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team , and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play ( including extra time , if any ) . Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a penalty kick , there are some differences . Most notably , neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked . The penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are currently approved by the Laws of the Game ; the others are extra time and , for two-legged ties , the away goals rule . A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner . The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organizing body . In most professional level competitions , two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time , and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods .",
