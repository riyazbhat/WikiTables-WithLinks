  "/wiki/Snowshoe": "A snowshoe is footwear for walking over snow . Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person 's foot does not sink completely into the snow , a quality called flotation . Snowshoeing is a form of hiking . Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings . Some modern snowshoes are similar , but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal , plastic , and synthetic fabric . In addition to distributing the weight , snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability . They must not accumulate snow , hence the latticework , and require bindings to attach them to the feet . In the past , snowshoes were essential tools for fur traders , trappers and anyone whose life or living depended on the ability to get around in areas of deep and frequent snowfall , and they remain necessary equipment for forest rangers and others who must be able to get around areas inaccessible to motorized vehicles when the snow is deep . However , snowshoes are mainly used today for recreation , primarily by hikers and runners who like to continue their hobby in wintertime . Snowshoeing is easy to learn and in appropriate conditions is a relatively safe and inexpensive recreational activity . However , snowshoeing in icy , steep terrain can be more dangerous .",
  "/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle": "An all-terrain vehicle ( ATV ) , also known as a quad ( bike ) , three-wheeler , four-track , four-wheeler , or quadricycle , as defined by the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires , with a seat that is straddled by the operator , along with handlebars for steering control . As the name implies , it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles . Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries , it is not street-legal within most states , territories , and provinces of Australia , the United States , or Canada . By the current ANSI definition , ATVs are intended for use by a single operator , although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger . In some countries , the passenger is not required to wear a helmet . [ citation needed ] These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs . The rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle , but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds . Also dirt bikes are considered to be ATVs as that they were designed for off-road use only . Although most are equipped with three or four wheels , six-wheel models exist for specialized applications . Engine sizes of ATVs currently for sale in the United States , ( as of 2008 products ) , range from 49 to 1,000 cc ( 0.049 to 1.0 L ; 3.0 to 61 cu in ) .",
  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",
  "/wiki/M1_Abrams": "The M1 Abrams is a third-generation American main battle tank designed by Chrysler Defense ( now General Dynamics Land Systems ) . Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons ( almost 62 metric tons ) , it introduced several innovative features , including a multifuel turbine engine , sophisticated Chobham composite armor , a computer fire control system , separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment , and NBC protection for crew safety . Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun , while later variants feature a licensed Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44 . The M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the MBT-70 project to replace the obsolescent M60 Patton . There are three main operational Abrams versions , the M1 , M1A1 , and M1A2 , with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament , protection , and electronics . Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009 . [ needs update ] Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D ( formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4 , respectively ) versions such as improved composite armor , better optics , digital systems and ammunition . The Abrams was due to be replaced by the Future Combat Systems XM1202 but due its cancellation , the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics , armor and firepower . The M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps . The export version is used by the armies of Egypt , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Australia , and Iraq . The Abrams was first used in combat in the Persian Gulf War and has seen combat in both the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War under U.S. service , while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in the war against ISIL and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the Yemeni Civil War .",

In Japan , it is known as the which was withdrawn from the market in 2009 . The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed , but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV . All 4Runners have been built in Japan at Toyota 's plant in Tahara , Aichi , or at the Hino Motors ( a Toyota subsidiary ) plant in Hamura . For Southeast Asia the Hilux Surf was replaced in 2005 by the similar Fortuner , which is based on the Hilux platform . , the 4Runner is sold in the United States , Canada , Central America , Bahamas , Ecuador , Peru , Chile and Colombia . The 4Runner came in at number five in a 2019 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the longest-lasting vehicles in the US . The 4Runner had 3.9 percent of vehicles over , according to the study .",
  "/wiki/Horse": "The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior . Horses are adapted to run , allowing them to quickly escape predators , possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down , with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .",
  "/wiki/Pound_(mass)": "The pound or pound-mass is a unit of mass used in the imperial , United States customary and other systems of measurement . Various definitions have been used ; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound , which is legally defined as exactly , and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois ounces . The international standard symbol for the avoirdupois pound is lb ; an alternative symbol is lb ( for most pound definitions ) , # ( chiefly in the U.S. ) , and \u2114 or \u2033\u0336 ( specifically for the apothecaries ' pound ) . The unit is descended from the Roman ( hence the abbreviation lb ) . The English word pound is cognate with , among others , German , Dutch , and Swedish . All ultimately derive from a borrowing into Proto-Germanic of the Latin expression ( the weight measured in libra ) , in which the word is the ablative case of the Latin noun ( weight ) . Usage of the unqualified term pound reflects the historical conflation of mass and weight . This accounts for the modern distinguishing terms pound-mass and pound-force .",
  "/wiki/Bagger_288": "Bagger 288 ( Excavator 288 ) , built by the German company Krupp for the energy and mining firm Rheinbraun , is a bucket-wheel excavator or mobile strip mining machine . When its construction was completed in 1978 , Bagger 288 superseded Big Muskie as the heaviest land vehicle in the world , at 13,500 tons . It took five years to design and manufacture , and five years to assemble with total cost reaching $ 100 million . In 1995 , it was itself superseded by the slightly heavier Bagger 293 ( 14,200 tons ) . NASA 's Crawler-Transporter still remains the largest self-propelled land vehicle in the world , since bucket-wheel excavators are powered by an external power source , and the Overburden Conveyor Bridge F60s hold the title of largest land vehicle of any type by physical dimensions .",
  "/wiki/Elephant": "Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals . Three species are currently recognised : the African bush elephant , the African forest elephant , and the Asian elephant . Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea ; extinct members include the mastodons . The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups , including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants . African elephants have larger ears and concave backs , whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears , and convex or level backs . Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk , tusks , large ear flaps , massive legs , and tough but sensitive skin . The trunk , also called a proboscis , is used for breathing , bringing food and water to the mouth , and grasping objects . Tusks , which are derived from the incisor teeth , serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging . The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication . The pillar-like legs carry their great weight . Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats , including savannahs , forests , deserts , and marshes . They are herbivorous , and they stay near water when it is accessible .",
  "/wiki/Mountain_bike": "A mountain bike or mountain bicycle ( abbreviated MTB ) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling . Mountain bikes share similarities with other bicycles , but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain . These typically include a front or full suspension , large knobby tires , more durable wheels , more powerful brakes , straight handlebars , and lower gear ratios for climbing steep grades . ) Mountain bikes are generally specialized for use on mountain trails , single track , fire roads , and other unpaved surfaces , although perhaps the majority of them are never used off pavement , and it is common to find hybrid road bikes based on mountain bike frames for sale . This type of terrain commonly has rocks , roots , loose dirt , and steep grades . Many trails have additional TTFs ( Technical Trail Features ) such as log piles , log rides , rock gardens , skinnies , gap jumps , and wall-rides . Mountain bikes are built to handle these types of terrain and features . The heavy-duty construction combined with stronger rims and wider tires has also made this style of bicycle popular with urban riders and couriers who must navigate through potholes and over curbs . Since the development of the sport in the 1970s , many new subtypes of mountain biking have developed , such as cross-country ( XC ) , all-day endurance , freeride , downhill , and a variety of track and slalom types . Each of these place different demands on the bike , requiring different designs for optimal performance . MTB development has led to an increase in suspension travel , now often up to , and gearing up to 27 speeds , to facilitate both climbing and rapid descents . Advancements in gearing have also led to a 1x ( pronounced one-by ) trend , simplifying the gearing to one chainring in the front and a cassette at the rear , typically with 9 to 12 sprockets .",
  "/wiki/Racing_bicycle": "A racing bicycle , also known as a road bike , and once popularly known as a ten speed , is a bicycle designed for competitive road cycling , a sport governed by and according to the rules of the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) . The UCI rules were altered in 1934 to exclude recumbent bicycles . The most important characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency at which the power from a rider 's pedal strokes can be transferred to the drive-train and subsequently to its wheels . To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed . The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture . The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling . The derailleur gear ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence . Other racing bicycles , especially those used in time trialling , prioritize aerodynamics over comfort .",
  "/wiki/Stiletto_heel": "A stiletto heel is a long , thin , high heel found on some boots and shoes . It is named after the stiletto dagger , the phrase being first recorded in the early 1930s . Stiletto heels may vary in length from 2.5 centimetres ( 1 inch ) to 25 cm ( 10 inches ) or more if a platform sole is used , and are sometimes defined as having a diameter at the ground of less than 1 cm ( slightly less than half an inch ) . Stiletto-style heels or shorter are called kitten heels . Not all high slim heels merit the description stiletto . The extremely slender original Italian-style stiletto heels of the late 1950s and very early 1960s were no more than in diameter for much of their length , although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the top-piece ( tip ) . After their demise in the mid-late 1960s , such slender heels were difficult to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced ."
