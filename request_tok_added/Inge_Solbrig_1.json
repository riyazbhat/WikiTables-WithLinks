Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly , The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group , owned by the Scott Trust . The trust was created in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference . The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008 , with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators .

Since 2018 , the paper 's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format . As of November that year , its print edition had a daily circulation of 136,834 . The newspaper has an online edition , TheGuardian.com , as well as two international websites , Guardian Australia ( founded in 2013 ) and Guardian US ( founded in 2011 ) .

Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting paper led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the Grauniad in the 1960s , a nickname still used today .",
