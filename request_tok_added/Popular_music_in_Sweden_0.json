  "/wiki/ABBA": "ABBA is a Swedish pop supergroup formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog , Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus , Benny Andersson , and Anni-Frid Lyngstad . The group 's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names . They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music , topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982 . ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 , giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest . They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition . During the band 's main active years , it was composed of two married couples : F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus , and Lyngstad and Andersson . With the increase of their popularity , their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages . The relationship changes were reflected in the group 's music , with latter compositions featuring darker and more introspective lyrics . After ABBA disbanded , Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage , while Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog pursued solo careers . Ten years after their disbanding , a compilation , ABBA Gold was released , which became a worldwide bestseller . In 1999 , ABBA 's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia ! that toured worldwide .",
  "/wiki/Pop_music": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern forms in the US and the UK during the mid-1950s . The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks .",
  "/wiki/Roxette": "Roxette was a Swedish pop rock and soft rock duo , consisting of Marie Fredriksson ( vocals and keyboards ) and Per Gessle ( vocals and guitar ) . Formed in 1986 , the duo became an international act in the late 1980s , when they released their breakthrough album Look Sharp ! Their third album Joyride , which was released in 1991 , became just as successful as its predecessor . Roxette went on to achieve nineteen UK Top 40 hits and several US Hot 100 hits , including four US number-ones with The Look , Listen to Your Heart , It Must Have Been Love , featured on the soundtrack of Pretty Woman , and Joyride . Their other hits include Dressed for Success , Dangerous , and Fading Like a Flower . Before coming together to form the duo , Fredriksson and Gessle were already established artists in Sweden , she having released a number of solo albums and he being the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider , a band that had three No . 1 albums . On the advice of the managing director of their record label , the two came together to record Neverending Love , which became a hit single in Sweden . After the release of Do n't Bore Us , Get to the Chorus ! , a greatest hits record , the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day ( 1999 ) and Room Service ( 2001 ) . They continued to chart in other territories , mainly in Europe and Latin America , where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium . In 2002 , the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour . Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in eight years , in 2009 , during Gessle 's European Party Crasher tour .",
  "/wiki/Pop_rock": "Pop rock ( also typeset as pop/rock ) is rock music with a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft , and less emphasis on attitude . Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll , early pop rock was influenced by the beat , arrangements , and original style of rock and roll ( and sometimes doo-wop ) . It may be viewed as a distinct genre field , rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock . The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick , commercial product , less authentic than rock music .",

  "/wiki/House_music": "House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat and a tempo of 120 to 130 beats per minute . It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago 's underground club culture in the 1980s , as DJs from the subculture began altering disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines . The genre was pioneered by DJs and producers mainly from Chicago and New York such as Frankie Knuckles , Larry Levan , Ron Hardy , Jesse Saunders , Chip E. , Steve Silk Hurley , Farley Jackmaster Funk , Mr . Fingers , Marshall Jefferson , Phuture , and many others . It 's origins derive from within the Black American LGBT communities but has since spread to the mainstream . From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene , the genre expanded internationally to London , then to other American cities such as New York City and Detroit , and has become a worldwide phenomenon ever since . It has spawned numerous subgenres , such as acid house , deep house , hip house , ghetto house , progressive house , tech house , electro house , and many more . House has had and still has a huge impact on pop music in general and dance music in particular . It was picked up by major pop artists like Janet Jackson , Madonna , and Kylie Minogue , but also produced some mainstream hits on its own , such as French Kiss by Lil Louis ( 1989 ) , Show Me Love by Robin S. ( 1992 ) , or Push the Feeling On by Nightcrawlers ( 1992 ) . Many house producers also did and do remixes for pop artists .

  "/wiki/Glam_metal": "Glam metal ( often used synonymously with pop metal , or pejoratively as hair metal ) is a subgenre of heavy metal , which features pop-influenced hooks and guitar riffs , and borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s glam rock . Early glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s , as visual elements taken from acts such as The New York Dolls and David Bowie ( and to a lesser extent , the punk and new wave movements taking place concurrently in New York City ) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as Alice Cooper and Kiss . The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States , particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene , pioneered by bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce , Ratt , Quiet Riot , Twisted Sister , Stryper , Def Leppard , Bon Jovi , and Dokken . It achieved huge commercial success from approximately 1983 until the early 1990s , bringing to prominence bands such as Poison , Skid Row , Cinderella and Warrant . From a strictly visual perspective , glam metal is defined by flashy and tight fitting clothing , makeup , and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional denim & leather aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by lace and heavy use of the color pink . Glam metal suffered a big loss in popularity beginning by the early 1990s as the grunge and alternative phenomenon revolutionized hard rock , and fans ' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style . During this period , many of the most successful acts of the genre 's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction . Glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the early 2000s , with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre 's 1980s heyday , as well as the emergence of new , predominantly European bands , including the Darkness , Santa Cruz , Reckless Love , The Struts , and Steel Panther .",
  "/wiki/Hard_rock": "Hard rock , a loosely-defined subgenre of rock music , began in the mid-1960s with the garage , psychedelic and blues rock movements . It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals , distorted electric guitars , bass guitar , and drums , often accompanied with keyboards . Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as the Who , Boston , Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , Kiss , Queen , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards pop rock , Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi , and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R & B , hip-hop , urban pop , grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s . Despite this , many post-grunge bands adopted a hard-rock sound , and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands , attempts at a revival , and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes . Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes , the Strokes , Interpol and , later on , the Black Keys . In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers .",

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",
