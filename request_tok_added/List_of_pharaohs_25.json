He was a member of the Theban royal house , the son of pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and brother of the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth dynasty , Kamose . During the reign of his father or grandfather , Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos , the rulers of Lower Egypt . When he was seven years old , his father was killed , and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years . Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother , and upon coronation became known as nb-p\u1e25tj-r\ua725 The Lord of Strength is Ra . During his reign , Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta , restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan . He then reorganized the administration of the country , reopened quarries , mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom . This building program culminated in the construction of the last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers . Ahmose 's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom , under which Egyptian power reached its peak . His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC .",
  "/wiki/Kamose": "Kamose was the last king of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty . He was possibly the son of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I and the full brother of Ahmose I , founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty . His reign fell at the very end of the Second Intermediate Period . Kamose is usually ascribed a reign of three years ( his highest attested regnal year ) , although some scholars now favor giving him a longer reign of approximately five years . His reign is important for the decisive military initiatives he took against the Hyksos , who had come to rule much of Ancient Egypt . His father had begun the initiatives and , quite possibly , lost his life in battle with the Hyksos . It is thought that his mother , as regent , continued the campaigns after the death of Kamose and that his full brother made the final conquest of them and united all of Egypt .",

His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC . He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari , but had at least two elder brothers , Ahmose-ankh and Ahmose Sapair , and was not expected to inherit the throne . However , sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I 's 17th regnal year and his death , his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince . He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years . Although his reign is poorly documented , it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence . He inherited the kingdom formed by his father 's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant . He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple , setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom .

He also built many temples in Egypt , and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings ; he is the first king confirmed to have done this ( though Amenhotep I may have preceded him ) . Thutmose I 's reign is generally dated to 1506-1493 BC , but a minority of scholars - who think that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records , and thus the reign of Thutmose I , were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes - would date his reign to 1526-1513 BC . He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II , who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II 's sister , Hatshepsut .",

She was a secondary wife of Thutmose I - Queen Ahmose was the chief wife - and the mother of Thutmose II . Based on her titles of King 's Daughter and King 's Sister , she is likely to have been a daughter of Ahmose I and a sister of Amenhotep I . It is likely that she was also the mother of Thutmose I 's other sons , Amenmose , Wadjmose and Ramose . She was depicted in the Deir el-Bahri temple built by her grandson Thutmose III ; on a stela found at the Ramesseum ; on the colossus of her son ; and a statue of her bearing a dedication by Thutmose II was found in Wadjmose 's chapel .

Her rise to power was noteworthy as it required her to utilize her bloodline , education , and an understanding of religion . Her bloodline was impeccable as she was the daughter , sister , and wife of a king . Her understanding of religion allowed her to establish herself as the Gods Wife of Amun . Officially , she ruled jointly with Thutmose III , who had ascended to the throne the previous year as a child of about two years old . Hatshepsut was the chief wife of Thutmose II , Thutmose IIIs father .

The region is known from ancient Egyptian records of trade expeditions to it . It is possible that it corresponds to Opone on the Horn of Africa , as later known by the ancient Greeks , while some biblical scholars have identified it with the biblical land of Put or Havilah . At times Punt is referred to as Ta netjer ( t\ua723 n\u1e6fr ) , the Land of the God . The exact location of Punt is still debated by historians . Most scholars today believe Punt was situated to the southeast of Egypt , most likely in the coastal region of modern Djibouti , Somalia , northeast Ethiopia , Eritrea , and the Red Sea littoral of Sudan . It is also possible that the territory covered both the Horn of Africa and Southern Arabia . Puntland , the Somali administrative region situated at the extremity of the Horn of Africa , is named in reference to the Land of Punt .

  "/wiki/The_Levant": "The Levant ( ) is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Western Asia . In its narrowest sense , it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria , which included present-day Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . In its widest historical sense , the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands ; that is , it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores , extending from Greece to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya . The term entered English in the late 15th century from French . It derives from the Italian Levante , meaning rising , implying the rising of the sun in the east , and is broadly equivalent to the term Al-Mashriq ( , ) , meaning the east , where the sun rises . In the 13th and 14th centuries , the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean , including Greece , Anatolia , Syria-Palestine , and Egypt , that is , the lands east of Venice . Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt . In 1581 , England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire . The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I . This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , and Cyprus . Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon . Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references .",
  "/wiki/Nubia": "Nubia ( ) is a region along the Nile river encompassing the area between Aswan in southern Egypt and Khartoum in central Sudan . It was the seat of one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa , as the Kerma culture lasted from around 2500 BCE until its conquest by the New Kingdom of Egypt under pharaoh Thutmose I around 1500 BCE . Nubia was home to several empires , most prominently the kingdom of Kush , which conquered Egypt during the 8th century BC during the reign of Piye and ruled the country as its Twenty-fifth Dynasty ( to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian Twenty-sixth Dynasty ) . The collapse of Kush in the 4th century AD after more than a thousand years of existence was precipitated by an invasion by Ethiopia 's Kingdom of Aksum and saw the rise of three Christian kingdoms , Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , the last two again lasting for roughly a millennium . Their eventual decline initiated not only the partition of Nubia into the northern half conquered by the Ottomans and the southern half by the Sennar sultanate in the 16th century , but also a rapid Islamization and partial Arabization of the Nubian people . Nubia was again united with the Khedivate of Egypt in the 19th century . Today , the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan .

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish .",

Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

In most religions which accept polytheism , the different gods and goddesses are representations of forces of nature or ancestral principles , and can be viewed either as autonomous or as aspects or emanations of a creator deity or transcendental absolute principle ( monistic theologies ) , which manifests immanently in nature ( panentheistic and pantheistic theologies ) . Most of the polytheistic deities of ancient religions , with the notable exceptions of the Ancient Egyptian and Hindu deities , were conceived as having physical bodies . Polytheism is a type of theism . Within theism , it contrasts with monotheism , the belief in a singular God , in most cases transcendent . Polytheists do not always worship all the gods equally , but they can be henotheists , specializing in the worship of one particular deity . Other polytheists can be kathenotheists , worshiping different deities at different times . Polytheism was the typical form of religion during the Bronze Age and Iron Age up to the Axial Age and the development of Abrahamic religions , the latter of which enforced strict monotheism . It is well documented in historical religions of Classical antiquity , especially ancient Greek religion and ancient Roman religion , and after the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism in tribal religions such as Germanic , Slavic and Baltic paganism .

It centered on the Egyptians ' interactions with many deities believed to be present in , and in control of , the world . Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor . Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs , the rulers of Egypt , believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions . They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods , and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at , the order of the cosmos . The state dedicated enormous resources to religious rituals and to the construction of temples . Individuals could interact with the gods for their own purposes , appealing for help through prayer or compelling the gods to act through magic . These practices were distinct from , but closely linked with , the formal rituals and institutions . The popular religious tradition grew more prominent over the course of Egyptian history as the status of the pharaoh declined . Egyptian belief in the afterlife and the importance of funerary practices is evident in the great efforts made to ensure the survival of their souls after death - via the provision of tombs , grave goods and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits of the deceased . The religion had its roots and branches in Egypt 's prehistory and lasted for more than 3,000 years .

  "/wiki/Akhetaten": "Amarna ( /\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0rn\u0259/ ; Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629 , romanized : al-\u02bfam\u0101rnah ) is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established ( 1346 BC ) and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty , and abandoned shortly after his death ( 1332 BC ) . The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten ( or Akhetaton - transliterations vary ) in English transliteration . Akhetaten means Horizon of the Aten . The area is located on the east bank of the Nile River in the modern Egyptian province of Minya , some 58 km ( 36 mi ) south of the city of al-Minya , 312 km ( 194 mi ) south of the Egyptian capital Cairo and 402 km ( 250 mi ) north of Luxor . The city of Deir Mawas lies directly west across from the site of Amarna . Amarna , on the east side , includes several modern villages , chief of which are el-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south . The area was also occupied during later Roman and early Christian times ; excavations to the south of the city have found several structures from this period .",
  "/wiki/Amun": "Amun ( also Amon , Ammon , Amen ; Greek \u1f0c\u03bc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u00c1mm\u014dn , \u1f0d\u03bc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd H\u00e1mm\u014dn ) was a major ancient Egyptian deity who appears as a member of the Hermopolitan Ogdoad . Amun was attested from the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amaunet . With the 11th dynasty ( c. 21st century BC ) , Amun rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Montu . After the rebellion of Thebes against the Hyksos and with the rule of Ahmose I ( 16th century BC ) , Amun acquired national importance , expressed in his fusion with the Sun god , Ra , as Amun-Ra or Amun-Re . Amun-Ra retained chief importance in the Egyptian pantheon throughout the New Kingdom ( with the exception of the Atenist heresy under Akhenaten ) . Amun-Ra in this period ( 16th to 11th centuries BC ) held the position of transcendental , self-created creator deity par excellence ; he was the champion of the poor or troubled and central to personal piety . His position as King of Gods developed to the point of virtual monotheism where other gods became manifestations of him . With Osiris , Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods . As the chief deity of the Egyptian Empire , Amun-Ra also came to be worshipped outside Egypt , according to the testimony of ancient Greek historiographers in Libya and Nubia . As Zeus Ammon , he came to be identified with Zeus in Greece .",
  "/wiki/Smenkhkare": "Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare Djeser Kheperu ( sometimes spelled Smenkhare , Smenkare or Smenkhkara ) was a short-lived pharaoh in the late 18th dynasty . The names of this pharaoh translate as 'Living are the Forms of Re ' and 'Vigorous is the Soul of Re - Holy of Forms ' . His or her reign , for it is uncertain whether Smenkhkare was male or female , was during the Amarna Period , a time when Akhenaten sought to impose new religious views . He or she is sometimes distinguished from the immediate predecessor ( successor ? ) , the female ruler Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten ( usually identified as Nefertiti ) . Unlike Neferneferuaten , Smenkhkare did not use epithets in his or her royal name or cartouche . Very little is known of Smenkhkare for certain because later kings , beginning with Horemheb , sought to erase the entire Amarna Period from history .",
  "/wiki/Nefertiti": "Neferneferuaten Nefertiti ( ) ( c. 1370 - c. 1330 BC ) was an Egyptian queen and the Great Royal Wife of Akhenaten , an Egyptian Pharaoh . Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution , in which they worshipped one god only , Aten , or the sun disc . With her husband , she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history . Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband 's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun , although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate . If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh , her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes . Nefertiti had many titles including Hereditary Princess ( iryt-p ` t ) ; Great of Praises ( wrt-Hzwt ) ; Lady of Grace ( nbt-im3t ) , Sweet of Love ( bnrt-mrwt ) ; Lady of The Two Lands ( nbt-t3wy ) ; Main King 's Wife , his beloved ( Hmt-nswt-3t mryt.f ) ; Great King 's Wife , his beloved ( Hmt-nswt-wrt mryt.f ) , Lady of All Women ( Hnwt-Hmwt-nbwt ) ; and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt ( Hnwt-Shmw-mhw ) . She was made famous by her bust , now in Berlin 's Neues Museum . The bust is one of the most copied works of ancient Egypt . It was attributed to the sculptor Thutmose , and it was found in his workshop .",
  "/wiki/Meritaten": "Meritaten , also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten ( 14th century BC ) , was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty . Her name means She who is beloved of Aten ; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father , Pharaoh Akhenaten , worshipped . She held several titles , performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare , who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten . Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name , Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten .",
  "/wiki/Neferneferuaten": "Ankhkheperure-mery-Neferkheperure/ -mery-Waenre/ -mery-Aten Neferneferuaten was a name used to refer to either Meritaten or , more likely , Nefertiti . The archaeological evidence relates to a woman who reigned as pharaoh toward the end of the Amarna Period during the Eighteenth Dynasty . Her sex is confirmed by feminine traces occasionally found in the name and by the epithet Akhet-en-hyes ( Effective for her husband ) , incorporated into one version of her second cartouche . She is to be distinguished from the king who used the name AnkhkheperureSmenkhkare-Djeser Kheperu , but without epithets appearing in either cartouche . If this individual is Nefertiti ruling as sole pharaoh , it has been theorized by Egyptologist and Archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass that her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes .",
  "/wiki/Deity": "A deity ( /\u02c8di\u02d0\u026ati/ ( listen ) , /\u02c8de\u026a-/ ( listen ) ) or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred . The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess ( in a polytheistic religion ) , or anything revered as divine . C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans , but who interacts with humans , positively or negatively , in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness , beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life . In the English language , a male deity is referred to as a god , while a female deity is referred to as a goddess . Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship . Monotheistic religions accept only one deity ( predominantly referred to as God ) , polytheistic religions accept multiple deities . Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities , considering them as aspects of the same divine principle ; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live , die and may be reborn like any other being . :35-37:357-58 Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their God as omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient , omnibenevolent , and eternal , none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a deity and various cultures conceptualized their deities differently . Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms , :96 while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways - masculine , feminine , androgynous and without gender . Historically , many ancient cultures - including the ancient Mesopotamians , Egyptians , Greeks , Romans , and Norsemen- personified natural phenomena , variously as either deliberate causes or effects . Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts . In Indian religions , deities were envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being 's body , as sensory organs and mind .",
  "/wiki/KV62": "KV62 is the standard Egyptological designation for the tomb of young pharaoh Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings , now renowned for the wealth of valuable antiquities that it contained . Howard Carter discovered it in 1922 underneath the remains of workmen 's huts built during the Ramesside Period ; this explains why it was largely spared the desecration and tomb clearances at the end of the 20th Dynasty , although it was robbed and resealed twice in the period after its completion . The tomb was densely packed with items in great disarray due to its small size , the two robberies , and the apparently hurried nature of its completion . It took eight years to empty due to the state of the tomb and to Carter 's meticulous recording technique . The contents were all transported to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . Tutankhamun 's tomb had been entered at least twice not long after his mummy was buried , and well before Carter 's discovery . The outermost doors were unsealed leading into the shrines enclosing the king 's nested coffins , though the inner two shrines remained intact and sealed .",
  "/wiki/Ay": "Ay was the penultimate pharaoh of Ancient Egypt 's 18th dynasty . He held the throne of Egypt for a brief four-year period ( 1323-1319 BC or 1327-1323 BC , depending on which chronology is followed ) , although he was a close advisor to two and perhaps three of the pharaohs who ruled before him and is thought to have been the power behind the throne during Tutankhamun 's reign . Ay 's prenomen or royal name - Kheperkheperure - means Everlasting are the Manifestations of Ra while his nomen Ay it-netjer reads as Ay , Father of the God . Records and monuments that can be clearly attributed to Ay are rare , not only due to his short length of reign , but also because his successor , Horemheb , instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him and other pharaohs associated with the unpopular Amarna Period .",
  "/wiki/Tiye": "Tiye ( c. 1398 BC - 1338 BC , also spelled Taia , Tiy and Tiyi ) was the daughter of Yuya and Tjuyu . She became the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III . She was the mother of Akhenaten and grandmother of Tutankhamun . In 2010 , DNA analysis confirmed her as the mummy known as The Elder Lady found in the tomb of Amenhotep II ( KV35 ) in 1898 .",
  "/wiki/Horemheb": "Horemheb ( sometimes spelled Horemhab or Haremhab and meaning Horus is in Jubilation ) was the last pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt . He ruled for 14 years somewhere between 1319 BC and 1292 BC . He had no relation to the preceding royal family other than by marriage to Mutnedjmet , who is disputed to have been the daughter of his predecessor Ay ; he is believed to have been of common birth . Before he became pharaoh , Horemheb was the commander in chief of the army under the reigns of Tutankhamun and Ay . After his accession to the throne , he reformed the Egyptian state and it was under his reign that official action against the preceding Amarna rulers began . Due to this , he is considered the man who restabilized his country after the troublesome and divisive Amarna Period . Horemheb demolished monuments of Akhenaten , reusing their remains in his own building projects , and usurped monuments of Tutankhamun and Ay . Horemheb presumably had no surviving sons , as he appointed his vizier Paramesse as his successor , who would assume the throne as Ramesses I .",
  "/wiki/Nakhtmin": "Nakhtmin ( also Minnakht ) held the position of generalissimo during the reign of pharaoh Tutankhamun of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt . His titles during the reign of Tutankhamun included the true servant who is beneficial to his lord , the king 's scribe , the servant beloved of his lord , the Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King , and the servant who causes to live the name of his lord . These titles were found on five ushabtis that Nakhtmin offered as funerary presents for pharaoh Tutankhamun . He was the heir to the throne during the reign of the pharaoh Ay though he never became a pharaoh . It is assumed by scholars that he died towards the end of the reign of Ay ( when he seemingly vanished from all records ) and Horemheb , the designated heir of Tutankhamun , became pharaoh instead ."
