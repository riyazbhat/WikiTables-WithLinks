Nicknamed the Dons and latterly also the Wombles , they won eight Isthmian League titles , the FA Amateur Cup in 1963 and three successive Southern League championships between 1975 and 1977 , and were then elected to the Football League . The team rose quickly from obscurity during the 1980s and were promoted to the then top-flight First Division in 1986 , just four seasons after being in the Fourth Division . Wimbledon 's Crazy Gang - so-called because of the boisterous , eccentric behaviour of the players - won the FA Cup in 1988 , beating that season 's League champions Liverpool , and thereby became one of only three clubs to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur counterpart . [ n 2 ] In 1991 , following the publication of the Taylor Report recommending all-seater grounds for top-flight clubs , Wimbledon left Plough Lane to groundshare with nearby Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park - an originally temporary arrangement that ended up lasting over a decade . The team remained in the First Division and its successor the FA Premier League until they were relegated in 2000 . In 2001 , after rejecting a variety of possible local sites and others further afield , the club announced its intention to move 56 miles ( 90 km ) north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire . The idea of Wimbledon leaving south London was deeply unpopular , both with the bulk of the club 's established fanbase and with football supporters generally , but an independent commission appointed by the Football Association granted permission in May 2002 . A group of supporters , appalled by the decision , responded by forming a new club , AFC Wimbledon , to which the large majority of Wimbledon fans immediately switched allegiance . Wimbledon F.C . played their first match in Milton Keynes in 2003 and changed their name to Milton Keynes Dons in 2004 .",
