  "/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland": "Ireland ( Irish : \u00c9ire [ \u02c8e\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) , also known as the Republic of Ireland ( Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann ) , is a country in north-western Europe occupying 26 of 32 counties of the island of Ireland . The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern side of the island . Around a third of the country 's population of 4.9 million people resides in the greater Dublin area . The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , St George 's Channel to the south-east , and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the Oireachtas , consists of a lower house , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , an upper house , Seanad \u00c9ireann , and an elected President ( Uachtar\u00e1n ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the D\u00e1il and appointed by the President ; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers . The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of Dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 .",
  "/wiki/Bohemian_F.C.": "Bohemian Football Club ( Irish : Cumann Peile B\u00f3ith\u00e9amaigh ) , more commonly referred to as Bohemians or Bohs , is a semi-professional football club from Dublin , Ireland . Bohemians compete in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland , and are the oldest League of Ireland club in continuous existence . Bohs are the third most successful club in League of Ireland football history , having won the League of Ireland title 11 times , the FAI Cup 7 times , the League of Ireland Shield 6 times and the League of Ireland Cup 3 times . Prior to the establishment of the Football Association of Ireland and League of Ireland , Bohemians competed in the Irish Football League and Irish Cup , which were at the time all-Ireland competitions . During that period they won the Irish Cup once and finished runners up 5 times . They share the record for most wins in European competition with archrivals Shamrock Rovers and hold the record for Leinster Senior Cup wins with 32 cups claimed . Bohemians were founded on 6 September 1890 in the Phoenix Park Gate Lodge beside the North Circular Road entrance and played its first games in the Park 's Polo Grounds . They were one of the founding members of the League of Ireland in 1921 , after their withdrawal from the Irish Football League . They established themselves as a major force within the first 15 years of the League of Ireland , winning 5 league titles , 2 FAI Cups and 4 Shields , but struggled for decades after that , largely due to their strict amateur status , going 34 seasons without winning a major trophy . Bohemians dropped their amateur ethos in 1969 and proceeded to win 2 League titles , 2 FAI Cups and 2 League cups during the 1970s . They suffered a further decline throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s before claiming League and Cup doubles in 2001 and 2008 , alongside the 2003 and most recently 2009 title wins . Bohemians play their home matches at Dalymount park in the Northside neighbourhood of Phibsborough .",

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
