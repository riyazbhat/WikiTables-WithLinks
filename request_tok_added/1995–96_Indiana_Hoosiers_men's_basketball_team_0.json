  "/wiki/Basketball_position": "The five basketball positions normally employed by organized basketball teams are the point guard ( PG ) , the shooting guard ( SG ) , the small forward ( SF ) , the power forward ( PF ) , and the center ( C ) . The point guard is the de facto leader of the team on the court . This position requires substantial ball handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play . The shooting guard , as the name implies , is often the best shooter . As well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer distances , this position tends to also be the best defender on the team . The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball . The small forward is also known to make cuts to the basket in efforts to get open for shots . The power forward and the center are usually called the frontcourt , often acting as their team 's primary rebounders or shot blockers , or receiving passes to take inside shots . The center is typically the larger of the two .",
