  "/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives": "The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover , Director of the FBI , and William Kinsey Hutchinson , International News Service ( the predecessor of the United Press International ) editor-in-chief , who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI 's toughest guys . This discussion turned into a published article , which received so much positive publicity that on March 14 , 1950 , the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement 's ability to capture dangerous fugitives . Individuals are generally only removed from the list if the fugitive is captured , dies , or if the charges against them are dropped ; they are then replaced by a new entry selected by the FBI . In ten cases , the FBI removed individuals from the list after deciding that they were no longer a particularly dangerous menace to society . Machetero member V\u00edctor Manuel Gerena , added to the list in 1984 , was on the list for 32 years , which was longer than anyone else . Billie Austin Bryant spent the shortest amount of time on the list , being listed for two hours in 1969 . The oldest person to be added to the list was Eugene Palmer on May 29 , 2019 , at 80 years old . On rare occasions , the FBI will add a Number Eleven if that individual is extremely dangerous but the Bureau does not feel any of the current ten should be removed . Despite occasional references in the media , the FBI does not rank their list ; no suspect is considered # 1 on the FBI 's Most Wanted List or The Most Wanted . The list is commonly posted in public places such as post offices . In many cases , fugitives on the list have turned themselves in on becoming aware of their listing .",

The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country , or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region .

Homelessness and poverty are interrelated . There is no methodological consent on counting the homeless and identifying their special needs , therefore in most of the cities only estimated homeless population is known . In 2005 , an estimated 100 million ( 1 in 65 at the time ) people worldwide were homeless and as many as 1 billion people live as squatters , refugees or in temporary shelter , all lacking adequate housing .

As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",
  "/wiki/Houston": "Houston ( /\u02c8hju\u02d0st\u0259n/ ( listen ) HEW-st\u0259n ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Texas , fourth most populous city in the United States , most populous city in the Southern United States , as well as the sixth most populous in North America , with an estimated 2018 population of 2,325,502 . Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area , which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018 . Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles ( 1,651 km2 ) , Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States ( including consolidated city-counties ) . It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",

People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants .",
