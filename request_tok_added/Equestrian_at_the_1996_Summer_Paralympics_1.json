  "/wiki/Dressage": "Dressage ( /\u02c8dr\u025bs\u0251\u02d0\u0292/ or /dr\u026a\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0\u0292/ ; a French term , most commonly translated to mean training ) is a highly skilled form of riding performed in exhibition and competition , as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery . As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation , dressage is described as the highest expression of horse training where horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements . Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games . Its fundamental purpose is to develop , through standardized progressive training methods , a horse 's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform , thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse . At the peak of a dressage horse 's gymnastic development , the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider 's minimal aids . The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement . The discipline has a rich history with ancient roots in the writings of Xenophon . Modern dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the Renaissance when Federico Grisone 's The Rules of Riding was published in 1550 , the first treatise on equitation in over a thousand years since Xenophon 's On Horsemanship . Much about training systems used today reflects practices of classical dressage . In modern dressage competition , successful training at the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of tests , prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena . Judges evaluate each movement on the basis of an objective standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign each movement a score from zero to ten - zero being not executed and 10 being excellent . A score of 9 is very good and is a high mark , while a competitor achieving all 6s ( or 60% overall ) should be considering moving on to the next level .",

  "/wiki/Trot_(horse_gait)": "The trot is a two-beat diagonal gait of the horse where the diagonal pairs of legs move forward at the same time with a moment of suspension between each beat . It has a wide variation in possible speeds , but averages about . A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog . An extremely fast trot has no special name , but in harness racing , the trot of a Standardbred is faster than the gallop of the average non-racehorse , and has been clocked at over . On June 29 , 2014 at Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania the Swedish standardbred Sebastian K trotted a mile in 1 minute , 49 seconds ( quarters were passed at 26:2 , 55:3 and 1,21:4 ) . This is equivalent to a 1000-pace in 1.07,7 or 53,14 kilometers per hour or 33 miles per hour . From the standpoint of the balance of the horse , the trot is a very stable gait and does not require the horse to make major balancing motions with its head and neck . Due to its many variations , the trot is a common gait that the horse is worked in for dressage . Eadweard Muybridge was the first to prove , by photography , in 1872 that there is a moment of suspension or unsupported transit during the trot gait .",
