With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

It lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and is spread over a central peninsula and its surroundings . An intraregional transport hub and popular tourist destination , the city is linked to the Adriatic islands and the Apennine peninsula . Home to Diocletian 's Palace , built for the Roman emperor in AD 305 , the city was founded as the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos ( A\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) in the 3rd or 2nd century BC . It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia , Salona . After the sack of Salona by the Avars and Slavs , the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees . Split became a Byzantine city . Later it drifted into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia , with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty . For much of the High and Late Middle Ages , Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states , caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia ( in union with Hungary ) for control over the Dalmatian cities . Venice eventually prevailed and during the early modern period Split remained a Venetian city , a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by Ottoman territory . Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the Morean War of 1699 , and in 1797 , as Venice fell to Napoleon , the Treaty of Campo Formio rendered the city to the Habsburg Monarchy .
