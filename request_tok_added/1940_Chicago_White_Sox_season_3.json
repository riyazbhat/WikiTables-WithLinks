  "/wiki/American_League": "The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs , or simply the American League ( AL ) , is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball ( MLB ) in the United States and Canada . It developed from the Western League , a minor league based in the Great Lakes states , which eventually aspired to major league status . It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season , 25 years after the formation of the National League ( the Senior Circuit ) . At the end of every season , the American League champion plays in the World Series against the National League champion ; two seasons did not end in playing a World Series ( 1904 , when the National League champion New York Giants refused to play their AL counterpart , and 1994 , when a players ' strike prevented the Series ) .
