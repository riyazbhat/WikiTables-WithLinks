It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",

Nowadays the festival is regarded as one of the most important in the specialty of independent film and auteur film . It has introduced ( to Spain ) directors and cinematographers who were previously unknown there . Spanish audiences became acquainted with names such as Ingmar Bergman , Luis Bu\u00f1uel , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Andrzej Wajda , Federico Fellini , Ermanno Olmi and Yilmaz G\u00fcney from the launch pad offered by Valladolid .

Valladolid , through various loopholes in state censorship , was able to present films that would otherwise have been impossible to see in Spain . An award or an enthusiastic reception from the audience and the critics meant , on numerous occasions , that the official state bodies gave the go-ahead to certain films which Francisco Franco 's regime considered out of line with their ideology . Much the same occurred with distribution on the arts circuit at the end of the 1960s : a film could be placed more easily if it had previously done well at Valladolid . Even after the death of Franco in 1975 , Valladolid continued to be the testing ground for films which had been banned . For example , the premiere in Spain of Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange at the 1975 festival is still recalled as a landmark . As one of Europe 's oldest festivals , Valladolid has always been characterised by its willingness to take risks and to innovate in its programming . It has also been keen to critically examine each new school or movement as it has arisen , whether it be German , Polish , Chinese , Canadian or otherwise .",

Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
