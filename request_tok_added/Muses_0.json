  "/wiki/Calliope": "In Greek mythology , Calliope ( ; , Kalliop\u0113 beautiful-voiced ) is the Muse who presides over eloquence and epic poetry ; so called from the ecstatic harmony of her voice . Hesiod and Ovid called her the Chief of all Muses .",
  "/wiki/Epic_poetry": "An epic poem , epic , epos , or epopee is a lengthy narrative poem , ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who , in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces , gave shape to the moral universe for their descendants , the poet and his audience , to understand themselves as a people or nation . Another type of epic poetry is epyllion ( plural : epyllia ) , which is a brief narrative poem with a romantic or mythological theme . The term , which means little epic , came into use in the nineteenth century . It refers primarily to the erudite , shorter hexameter poems of the Hellenistic period and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the neoterics ; to a lesser degree , the term includes some poems of the English Renaissance , particularly those influenced by Ovid . The most famous example of classical epyllion is perhaps Catullus 64 .",
  "/wiki/Wax_tablet": "A wax tablet is a tablet made of wood and covered with a layer of wax , often linked loosely to a cover tablet , as a double-leaved diptych . It was used as a reusable and portable writing surface in Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages . Cicero 's letters make passing reference to the use of cerae , and some examples of wax-tablets have been preserved in waterlogged deposits in the Roman fort at Vindolanda on Hadrian 's Wall . Medieval wax tablet books are on display in several European museums . Writing on the wax surface was performed with a pointed instrument , a stylus . A straight-edged spatula-like implement ( often placed on the opposite end of the stylus tip ) would be used as an eraser . The modern expression of a clean slate equates to the Latin expression tabula rasa . Wax tablets were used for a variety of purposes , from taking down students ' or secretaries ' notes to recording business accounts . Early forms of shorthand were used too .",
  "/wiki/Stylus": "A stylus or stylo , plural styli or styluses , is a writing utensil or a small tool for some other form of marking or shaping , for example , in pottery . It can also be a computer accessory that is used to assist in navigating or providing more precision when using touchscreens . It usually refers to a narrow elongated staff , similar to a modern ballpoint pen . Many styluses are heavily curved to be held more easily . Another widely used writing tool is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille . Styluses were first used by the ancient Mesopotamians in order to write in cuneiform . They were mostly made of reeds and had a slightly curved trapezoidal section . Egyptians ( Middle Kingdom ) and the Minoans of Crete ( Linear A and Cretan Hieroglyphic ) made styluses in various materials : reeds that grew on the sides of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and in marshes and down to Egypt where the Egyptians used styluses from sliced reeds with sharp points ; bone and metal styluses were also used . Cuneiform was entirely based on the wedge-shaped mark that the end of a cut reed made when pushed into a clay tablet ; from Latin cuneus = wedge . The linear writings of Crete in the first half of the second millennium BC which were made on clay tablets that were left to dry in the sun until they became leather hard before being incised by the stylus . The linear nature of the writing was also dictated by the use of the stylus . In Western Europe styluses were widely used until the late Middle Ages .",
  "/wiki/Lyre": "The lyre ( Greek : \u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 , l\u00fdra ) is a string instrument known for its use in Greek classical antiquity and later periods . The lyre is similar in appearance to a small harp but with distinct differences . In organology , lyre is defined as a yoke lute , being a lute in which the strings are attached to a yoke that lies in the same plane as the sound-table and consists of two arms and a cross-bar . In Ancient Greece , recitations of lyric poetry were accompanied by lyre playing . The earliest picture of a lyre with seven strings appears in the famous sarcophagus of Hagia Triada ( a Minoan settlement in Crete ) . The sarcophagus was used during the Mycenaean occupation of Crete ( c. 1400 BC ) . The lyre of classical antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum ( pick ) , like a guitar or a zither , rather than being plucked with the fingers as with a harp . The fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings in the chord . Other instruments , also called lyres , were played with a bow in Europe and parts of the Middle East , namely the Arabic rebab and its descendants , including the Byzantine lyra .",

  "/wiki/History": "History ( from Greek \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 , historia , meaning 'inquiry ; knowledge acquired by investigation ' ) is the past as it is described in written documents , and the study thereof . Events occurring before written records are considered prehistory . History is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory , discovery , collection , organization , presentation , and interpretation of information about these events . Scholars who write about history are called historians . History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events , and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them . Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present . Stories common to a particular culture , but not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) , are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history . Herodotus , a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered within the Western tradition to be the father of history , or by some the father of lies , and , along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history . Their works continue to be read today , and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing . In East Asia , a state chronicle , the Spring and Autumn Annals , was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived . Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today . The modern study of history is wide-ranging , and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation .",

  "/wiki/Book": "A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images , typically composed of many pages ( made of papyrus , parchment , vellum , or paper ) bound together and protected by a cover . The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex ( in the plural , codices ) . In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records , the codex replaces its immediate predecessor , the scroll . A single sheet in a codex is a leaf , and each side of a leaf is a page . As an intellectual object , a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable , though not so extensive , investment of time to read . This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense . In the restricted sense , a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition , a usage that reflects the fact that , in antiquity , long works had to be written on several scrolls , and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained . So , for instance , each part of Aristotle 's Physics is called a book . In the unrestricted sense , a book is the compositional whole of which such sections , whether called books or chapters or parts , are parts . The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition , nor even be called a book . Books can consist only of drawings , engravings , or photographs , or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls . In a physical book , the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for on-going entries , i.e. , an account book , an appointment book , a log book , an autograph book , a notebook , a diary or day book , or a sketchbook .",
  "/wiki/Cornett": "The cornett , cornetto , or zink is an early wind instrument that dates from the Medieval , Renaissance and Baroque periods , popular from 1500 to 1650 . It was used in what are now called alta capellas or wind ensembles . It is not to be confused with the trumpet-like cornet . The sound of the cornett is produced by lip vibrations against a cup mouthpiece . A cornett consists of a conical wooden pipe covered in leather , is about long , and has finger holes and a small horn or ivory mouthpiece .",
  "/wiki/Laurel_wreath": "A laurel wreath is a round wreath made of connected branches and leaves of the bay laurel ( Laurus nobilis ) , an aromatic broadleaf evergreen , or later from spineless butcher 's broom ( Ruscus hypoglossum ) or cherry laurel ( Prunus laurocerasus ) . It is a symbol of triumph and is worn as a chaplet around the head , or as a garland around the neck . The symbol of the laurel wreath traces back to Greek mythology . Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head , and wreaths were awarded to victors in athletic competitions , including the ancient Olympics - for which they were made of wild olive-tree known as kotinos ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) , ( sc . at Olympia ) - and in poetic meets . In Rome they were symbols of martial victory , crowning a successful commander during his triumph . Whereas ancient laurel wreaths are most often depicted as a horseshoe shape , modern versions are usually complete rings . In common modern idiomatic usage it refers to a victory . The expression resting on one 's laurels refers to someone relying entirely on long-past successes for continued fame or recognition , where to look to one 's laurels means to be careful of losing rank to competition .",
  "/wiki/Erato": "In Greek mythology , Erato ( ; Ancient Greek : \u1f18\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce ) is one of the Greek Muses . The name would mean desired or lovely , if derived from the same root as Eros , as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica . Erato is the Muse of love poetry . In the Orphic hymn to the Muses , it is Erato who charms the sight . Since the Renaissance she has mostly been shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses , holding a lyre , or a small kithara , a musical instrument often associated with Apollo . In Simon Vouet 's representations , two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet . Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow , reminding one of the eros , the feeling that she inspires in everybody , and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros , holding a torch .",
  "/wiki/Love_poetry": "Poetry ( derived from the Greek poiesis , making ) is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language - such as phonaesthetics , sound symbolism , and metre - to evoke meanings in addition to , or in place of , the prosaic ostensible meaning . Poetry has a long history dating back to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa , and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile , Niger , and Volta River valleys . Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa is found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE . The earliest Western Asian epic poetry , the Epic of Gilgamesh , was written in Sumerian . Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing ; or from a need to retell oral epics , as with the Sanskrit Vedas , the Zoroastrian Gathas , and the Homeric epics , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry , such as Aristotle 's Poetics , focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric , drama , song , and comedy . Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition , verse form , and rhyme , and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing . Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words , or to evoke emotive responses . Devices such as assonance , alliteration , onomatopoeia , and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects . The use of ambiguity , symbolism , irony , and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations . Similarly , figures of speech such as metaphor , simile , and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images - a layering of meanings , forming connections previously not perceived . Kindred forms of resonance may exist , between individual verses , in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm .",
  "/wiki/Cithara": "The cithara or kithara ( , ) was an ancient Greek musical instrument in the yoke lutes family . In modern Greek the word kithara has come to mean guitar , a word which etymologically stems from kithara . The kithara was a professional version of the four-stringed lyre . As opposed to the simpler lyre , which was a folk-instrument , the kithara was primarily used by professional musicians , called kitharodes . The kithara 's origins are likely Anatolian . The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern Aegean and ancient Anatolia . In the Middle Ages , cythara was also used generically for stringed instruments including lyres , but also including lute-like instruments . The use of the name throughout the Middle Ages looked back to the original Greek kithara , and its abilities to sway people 's emotions .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Greek": "Ancient Greek includes the forms of the Greek language used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD .

It is preceded by Mycenaean Greek and succeeded by Medieval Greek . Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage although its earliest form closely resembles Attic Greek and its latest form approaches Medieval Greek . There were several regional dialects of Ancient Greek , of which Attic Greek developed into Koine . Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians , playwrights , and philosophers .

  "/wiki/Musical_instrument": "A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds . In principle , any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument - it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument . The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture . Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual , such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt , or a drum in a religious ceremony . Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment . Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications . The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed . The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument , a simple flute , dates back as far as 67,000 years . Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago . However , most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them . Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins , bone , wood of specified trees , and other non-durable materials . Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world .",

  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches ( melodies ) using patterns of sound and silence . Songs contain various forms , such as those including the repetition and variation of sections . Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created , are called lyrics . If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song . Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants . Songs in a simple style that are learned informally by ear are often referred to as folk songs . Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs . These songs , which have broad appeal , are often composed by professional songwriters , composers and lyricists . Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances .

  "/wiki/Tragedy": "Tragedy ( from the , trag\u014didia ) is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences . While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response , the term tragedy often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilization . That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous , yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity - the Greeks and the Elizabethans , in one cultural form ; Hellenes and Christians , in a common activity , as Raymond Williams puts it . From its origins in the theatre of ancient Greece 2500 years ago , from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides , as well as many fragments from other poets ; through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare , Lope de Vega , Jean Racine , and Friedrich Schiller to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg ; Samuel Beckett 's modernist meditations on death , loss and suffering ; M\u00fcller 's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon , tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation , negotiation , struggle , and change . A long line of philosophers - which includes Plato , Aristotle , Saint Augustine , Voltaire , Hume , Diderot , Hegel , Schopenhauer , Kierkegaard , Nietzsche , Freud , Benjamin , Camus , Lacan , and Deleuze - have analysed , speculated upon , and criticised the genre . In the wake of Aristotle 's Poetics ( 335 BCE ) , tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions , whether at the scale of poetry in general ( where the tragic divides against epic and lyric ) or at the scale of the drama ( where tragedy is opposed to comedy ) . In the modern era , tragedy has also been defined against drama , melodrama , the tragicomic , and epic theatre . Drama , in the narrow sense , cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialisation from the mid-19th century onwards . Both Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal define their epic theatre projects ( non-Aristotelian drama and Theatre of the Oppressed , respectively ) against models of tragedy . Taxidou , however , reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation .",

  "/wiki/Sword": "A sword is a bladed , melee weapon intended for slashing or thrusting that is longer than a knife or dagger , consisting of a long blade attached to a hilt . The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographic region under consideration . The blade can be straight or curved . Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the blade , and tend to be straighter ; slashing swords have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade , and are more likely to be curved . Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing . Historically , the sword developed in the Bronze Age , evolving from the dagger ; the earliest specimens date to about 1600 BC . The later Iron Age sword remained fairly short and without a crossguard . The spatha , as it developed in the Late Roman army , became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages , at first adopted as the Migration Period sword , and only in the High Middle Ages , developed into the classical arming sword with crossguard . The word sword continues the Old English , sweord . The use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or , in a modern context , as fencing . In the Early Modern period , western sword design diverged into roughly two forms , the thrusting swords and the sabers . The thrusting swords such as the rapier and eventually the smallsword were designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds .",

In popular culture , clubs are associated with primitive cultures , especially cavemen . Most clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand , although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective . Various specialized clubs are used in martial arts and other fields , including the law-enforcement baton .

The word buskin , only recorded in English since 1503 meaning half boot , is of unknown origin , perhaps from Old French brousequin ( in modern French brodequin ) or directly from its Middle Dutch model brosekin small leather boot . Figurative senses relating to tragedy are from the word being used ( since 1570 ) to translate Greek kothornos ( ) or Latin cothurnus , the high , thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy ; contrasted with sock ( from Latin soccus ) , the low shoe worn by comedians .

  "/wiki/Dance": "Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement . This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value , and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture . [ nb 1 ] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements , or by its historical period or place of origin . An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance , although these two categories are not always completely separate ; both may have special functions , whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred/liturgical . Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality , including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronised swimming , marching bands , and many other forms of athletics .",

  "/wiki/Thalia_(Muse)": "Thalia ( or ; ; the joyous , the flourishing , from , th\u00e1llein ; to flourish , to be verdant ) , also spelled Thaleia , was the goddess who presided over comedy and idyllic poetry . In this context her name means flourishing , because the praises in her songs flourish through time . She was the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne , the eighth-born of the nine Muses . According to pseudo-Apollodorus , she and Apollo were the parents of the Corybantes . Other ancient sources , however , gave the Corybantes different parents . She was portrayed as a young woman with a joyous air , crowned with ivy , wearing boots and holding a comic mask in her hand . Many of her statues also hold a bugle and a trumpet ( both used to support the actors ' voices in ancient comedy ) , or occasionally a shepherd 's staff or a wreath of ivy .",
  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Vaudeville": "Vaudeville ( /\u02c8v\u0254\u02d0d ( \u0259 ) v\u026al/ ; French : [ vodvil ] ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 19th century . A vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions , based on a comical situation : a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry , interspersed with songs or ballets . It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s , but the idea of vaudeville 's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent . In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain , a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate , unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill . Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians , singers , dancers , comedians , trained animals , magicians , ventriloquists , strongmen , female and male impersonators , acrobats , clowns , illustrated songs , jugglers , one-act plays or scenes from plays , athletes , lecturing celebrities , minstrels , and movies . A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a vaudevillian . Vaudeville developed from many sources , also including the concert saloon , minstrelsy , freak shows , dime museums , and literary American burlesque . Called the heart of American show business , vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades .",

It uses mathematics , physics , and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution . Objects of interest include planets , moons , stars , nebulae , galaxies , and comets . Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions , gamma ray bursts , quasars , blazars , pulsars , and cosmic microwave background radiation . More generally , astronomy studies everything that originates outside Earth 's atmosphere . Cosmology is a branch of astronomy . It studies the Universe as a whole . Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences . The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky . These include the Babylonians , Greeks , Indians , Egyptians , Nubians , Iranians , Chinese , Maya , and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas . In the past , astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry , celestial navigation , observational astronomy , and the making of calendars . Nowadays , professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics .",

  "/wiki/Compass_(drafting)": "A compass , also known as a pair of compasses , is a technical drawing instrument that can be used for inscribing circles or arcs . As dividers , they can also be used as tools to measure distances , in particular on maps . Compasses can be used for mathematics , drafting , navigation and other purposes . Compasses are usually made of metal or plastic , and consist of two parts connected by a hinge which can be adjusted to allow the changing of the radius of the circle drawn . Typically one part has a spike at its end , and the other part a pencil , or sometimes a pen . Prior to computerization , compasses and other tools for manual drafting were often packaged as a bow set with interchangeable parts . By the mid-twentieth century , circle templates supplemented the use of compasses . Today these facilities are more often provided by computer-aided design programs , so the physical tools serve mainly a didactic purpose in teaching geometry , technical drawing , etc ."
