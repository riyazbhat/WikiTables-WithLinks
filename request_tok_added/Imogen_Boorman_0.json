  "/wiki/The_Tripods_(TV_series)": "The Tripods is a television adaptation of John Christopher 's The Tripods series of novels . It was jointly produced by the BBC in the United Kingdom and the Seven Network in Australia . The music soundtrack was written by Ken Freeman . Series one of The Tripods , broadcast in 1984 , which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the author of many radio plays Alick Rowe , covers the first book , The White Mountains ; the 12-episode second series ( 1985 ) written by Christopher Penfold covers The City of Gold and Lead . Although a television script had been written for the third series , it never went into production . The first series was released on both VHS and DVD . The BBC released Tripods - The Complete Series 1 & 2 on DVD in March 2009 . The series introduced several minor changes from the book , notably the shape of the Masters and Tripods , which have tentacles ( although the Tripods do have a mechanical claw-arm that they sometimes use ) in the book ; the Black Guard was introduced to serve as a tangible human antagonist as overuse of the Tripods themselves would be expensive to film and undermine their dramatic presence ; gravity inside the Golden City was increased artificially , which is not mentioned in the TV series ; the introduction of cognoscs , spiritual life-forms vastly superior to the Masters themselves ; and more other main characters , including love interests for both Will and Beanpole . The original texts have few female characters . John Christopher was asked about this for an interview on Wordcandy , replying that at the time of writing the series , it was generally accepted that girls would read books with boy main characters , but not vice versa . He also stated that he felt the addition of an entire family of girls to the TV series was somewhat over the top . The series is also notable for featuring non-humanoid aliens , which was uncommon at the time .",

Screen One attracted many names familiar to television and film audiences , including the likes of Alfred Molina , Sean Bean , David Thewlis , Ray Winstone , Alan Bates , Judi Dench , James Fox , Keith Allen , Bob Peck , Alun Armstrong , Marina Sirtis , David Jason , Brenda Blethyn , James Bolam , Adrian Edmondson , Alison Steadman , Timothy West , Clive Russell and Janet McTeer .
