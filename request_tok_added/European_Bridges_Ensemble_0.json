  "/wiki/Anne_La_Berge": "Anne La Berge ( born Palo Alto , California , in 1955 ) is a flutist , composer and improviser , currently residing in Amsterdam . Her performances bring together a virtuosic command of her instrument , a penchant for improvising microtonal textures and melodies , and an array of percussive flute effects , all combined with electronic processing . These have distinguished her as a pioneer in a wide array of new techniques . Many of her compositions involve her own participation , though she has produced works intended solely for other performers , usually involving guided improvisation and electronics . She is known for her use of texts that form part of her compositions and improvisations . In addition to creating her own work , she regularly performs in other artists projects in a range of settings from modern chamber music to improvised electronic music . While pursuing PhD research at the University of California , San Diego in the mid-1980s she formed a duo with flutist John Fonville , commissioning new works and exploring extended techniques on flute , particularly with regard to microtonal scales . She moved to Amsterdam in 1989 , where she has lived ever since . In 1999 , together Steve Heather and Cor Fuhler , she founded Kraakgeluiden , a improvisation series based in Amsterdam , exploring combinations of acoustic instruments , electronic instruments and computers , and using real-time interactive performance systems . Many of the musical collaborations that have resulted have taken on a life beyond the Kraakgeluiden series , which ceased in 2006 . La Berges own music has evolved in parallel , and the flute has become only one element in a sound world that includes samples , synthesis , the use of spoken text and electronic processing . In 2006 - 2007 she collaborated with Dr. David LaBerge .",
  "/wiki/John_Cage": "John Milton Cage Jr. ( September 5 , 1912 - August 12 , 1992 ) was an American composer , music theorist , artist , and philosopher . A pioneer of indeterminacy in music , electroacoustic music , and non-standard use of musical instruments , Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde . Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century . He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance , mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham , who was also Cage 's romantic partner for most of their lives . Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4\u203233\u2033 , which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound ; musicians who present the work do nothing aside from being present for the duration specified by the title . The content of the composition is not four minutes and 33 seconds of silence , as is often assumed , but rather the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance . The work 's challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance . Cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano ( a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers ) , for which he wrote numerous dance-related works and a few concert pieces . The best known of these is Sonatas and Interludes ( 1946-48 ) . His teachers included Henry Cowell ( 1933 ) and Arnold Schoenberg ( 1933-35 ) , both known for their radical innovations in music , but Cage 's major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures . Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s , Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music , which he started composing in 1951 . The I Ching , an ancient Chinese classic text decision-making tool , which uses chance operations to suggest answers to questions one may pose , became Cage 's standard composition tool for the rest of his life .",
