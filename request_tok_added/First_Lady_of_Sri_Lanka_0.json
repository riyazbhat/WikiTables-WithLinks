  "/wiki/N\u00e9e": "The birth name is the name of the person given upon their birth . The term may be applied to the surname , the given name or to the entire name . Where births are required to be officially registered , the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person 's legal name . The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth ( or perhaps from baptism or brit milah ) will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairs - either throughout life , or until marriage . Some possible changes concern middle names , diminutive forms , and changes relating to parental status ( due to one 's parents ' divorce , or adoption by different parents ) . Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only , rather than for life . The term dead name is sometimes used to refer to the birth names of transgender people that have been changed to match their gender identity as part of their transitioning .",
