Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",
  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",

It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server .

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Symbian": "Symbian is a discontinued mobile operating system ( OS ) and computing platform designed for smartphones . Symbian was originally developed as a closed-source OS for PDAs in 1998 by the Symbian Ltd. consortium . Symbian OS was a descendant of Psion 's EPOC , and ran exclusively on ARM processors , although an unreleased x86 port existed . Symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands , like Samsung , Motorola , Sony Ericsson , and above all by Nokia . It was also prevalent in Japan by brands including Fujitsu , Sharp and Mitsubishi . As a pioneer that established the smartphone industry , it was the most popular smartphone OS on a worldwide average until the end of 2010at a time when smartphones were in limited usewhen it was overtaken by iOS and Android . It was notably not as popular in North America . The Symbian OS platform is formed of two components : one being the microkernel-based operating system with its associated libraries , and the other being the user interface ( as middleware ) , which provides the graphical shell atop the OS . The most prominent user interface was the S60 ( formerly Series 60 ) platform built by Nokia , first released in 2002 and powering most Nokia Symbian devices . UIQ was a competing user interface mostly used by Motorola and Sony Ericsson that focused on pen-based devices , rather than a traditional keyboard interface from S60 . Another interface was the MOAP ( S ) platform from carrier NTT DoCoMo in the Japanese market . Applications of these different interfaces were not compatible with each other , despite each being built atop Symbian OS .",
