  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",

  "/wiki/Graeme_Hick": "Graeme Ashley Hick ( born 23 May 1966 ) is a former English cricketer who played 65 Test matches and 120 One Day Internationals for England . He was born in Rhodesia , and as a young man played international cricket for Zimbabwe . He played English county cricket for Worcestershire for his entire English domestic career , a period of well over twenty years , and in 2008 surpassed Graham Gooch 's record for the most matches in all forms of the game combined . He scored more than 40,000 first-class runs , mostly from number three in the order , and he is one of only three players to have passed 20,000 runs in List A cricket ( Graham Gooch and Sachin Tendulkar are the others ) and is one of only twenty-five players to have scored 100 centuries in first-class cricket . He is the only cricketer who scored first-class triple hundreds in three different decades ( 1988 , 1997 and 2002 ) . He is the second highest run scorer of all time after Graham Gooch . Despite these achievements , he is commonly held to have underachieved in international cricket , a view based on comparison of Hick 's overall first-class batting average of 52.23 vis-\u00e0-vis his Test average of 31.32 . At one time Hick 's bowling was a significant force , and his off-spin claimed more than 200 first-class wickets . However , after 2001 he rarely bowled , and took only one first-class and two List A wickets ; indeed , after the 2004 season he did not bowl a single ball in either form of the game . Throughout his career he was an outstanding slip fielder : Gooch wrote in his autobiography that his ideal slip cordon would comprise Mark Taylor , Ian Botham and Hick . Hick was granted a benefit season by Worcestershire in 1999 , which raised over \u00a3345,000 ; he was also awarded a testimonial in 2006 . Hick retired from county cricket at the end of the 2008 season , to take up a coaching post at Malvern College .",
  "/wiki/Off_spin": "Off spin is a type of finger spin bowling in cricket . A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner . Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers to spin the ball from a right-handed batsman 's off side to the leg side ( that is , towards the right-handed batsman , or away from a left-handed batsman ) . This contrasts with leg spin , in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action . A left-handed bowler who bowls with the same action as an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler . While the orthodox spinner has the same action as an off-spinner , the ball itself spins in the opposite direction ( akin to a right arm leg spinner ) . Off spin is generally considered less difficult to play than leg spin , as off breaks typically spin less than leg breaks , and do not generally possess the same loopy , potentially deceptive flight . In addition , off spinners tend to have a smaller repertoire of deliveries to choose from . However , the off spinner often bowls faster and more accurately than a leg spinner , and can therefore deceive the batsman with changes in the pace of the ball . Another common weapon of the off spinner is the arm ball , which does not spin but goes straight on with the arm . More skilled offspinners also have the topspinner . Aside from these variations in spin , varying the speed , length and flight of the ball are also important for the off spinner .",
