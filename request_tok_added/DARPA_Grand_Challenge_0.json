  "/wiki/Bayesian_inference": "Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes ' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available . Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics , and especially in mathematical statistics . Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data . Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities , including science , engineering , philosophy , medicine , sport , and law . In the philosophy of decision theory , Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability , often called Bayesian probability .",
  "/wiki/Mac_Mini": "The Mac mini ( stylized with a lowercase mini ) is a desktop computer made by Apple Inc . It is one of four desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup , serving as an alternative to the all-in-one iMac , and sits below the performance range iMac Pro and Mac Pro . The Mac mini is Apple 's only consumer desktop computer since 1998 to ship without a display , keyboard , or mouse . Apple initially marketed it as BYODKM ( Bring Your Own Display , Keyboard , and Mouse ) , pitching it to users switching from a traditional PC running operating systems such as Microsoft Windows . It uses many laptop components to achieve its small size . The Mac mini was introduced in January 2005 , using PowerPC G4 processors . The second generation Mac mini , introduced in February 2006 , carried over the design of the PowerPC version , but used Intel Core processors and other upgraded components , and made wireless connections such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standard . The third generation Mac mini was introduced in June 2010 , with a thinner unibody aluminum case . It was the first Mac with an HDMI port , more readily positioning it as a home theater device alternative to the Apple TV . Later revisions added Thunderbolt and Intel Core i5 and i7 processors . The fourth generation Mac mini was introduced in October 2018 . It carries over the design of the previous generation in a darker space gray finish , switches to standard solid-state storage , and replaces most data ports with USB-C. A server version of the Mac mini , bundled with the Server edition of the OS X operating system , was offered from 2009 to 2014 .",

  "/wiki/Windows_XP": "Windows XP is a personal computer operating system produced by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems . It was released to manufacturing on August 24 , 2001 , and broadly released for retail sale on October 25 , 2001 . Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as Neptune , an operating system ( OS ) built on the Windows NT kernel which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer use . An updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market ; however , in January 2000 , both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed Whistler , which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets . As such , Windows XP was the first consumer edition of Windows not to be based on MS-DOS . Upon its release , Windows XP received critical acclaim , with critics noting increased performance and stability ( especially in comparison to Windows Me , the previous version of Windows aimed at home users ) , a more intuitive user interface , improved hardware support , and expanded multimedia capabilities . However , some industry reviewers were concerned by the new licensing model and product activation system . Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8 , 2014 , after which the operating system ceased receiving further support or security updates ( with exceptional security updates being made e.g . in 2019 , to address potential ransomware threats ) to most users . By August 2019 , Microsoft ( and others ) had ended support for games on Windows XP . As of February 2020 [ update ] , 1.25% of Windows PCs run Windows XP , and a little under 1% of all traditional PCs run Windows XP . At least one country has double digit use : Armenia , where it is highest ranked at 40.76% as of January 2020 ; use in China is also exceptionally high at 3.94% as of January 2020 .",

  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",

  "/wiki/JAUS": "Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems ( JAUS ) , formerly known as Joint Architecture for Unmanned Ground Systems ( JAUGS ) , was originally an initiative started in 1998 by the United States Department of Defense to develop an open architecture for the domain of unmanned systems . In order to ensure that the component architecture is applicable to the entire domain of current and future unmanned systems , it is built on five principles : vehicle platform independence , mission isolation , computer hardware independence , technology independence , and operator use independence . The JAUS Reference Architecture , which is no longer being maintained , is a component based message passing architecture that defines a data format and methods of communication between computing nodes . The architecture dictates a hierarchical system built up of subsystems , nodes and components , and contains a strictly defined message set to support interoperability . Significant portions of the architecture , including the definitions for subsystem , node and component , have been loosely defined in order to accommodate for the five principles on which it is based . The architecture has migrated from the JAUS Working Group , which was composed of individuals from the government , industry and academia , to the Society of Automotive Engineers , Aerospace Division , Avionics Systems Division . The AS4 , Unmanned Systems Technical Committee now maintains and advances the set of standards . The following standards have been migrated from the JAUS Reference Architecture to a services based framework : Others currently in draft include : Another standard that evolved from the JAUS efforts is the JAUS Service Interface Definition Language or JSIDL . JSIDL standardizes the language for defining JAUS compliant interfaces . The specification is contained in the SAE document AS5684 .",

  "/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling": "Automated planning and scheduling , sometimes denoted as simply AI planning , is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences , typically for execution by intelligent agents , autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles . Unlike classical control and classification problems , the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space . Planning is also related to decision theory . In known environments with available models , planning can be done offline . Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution . In dynamically unknown environments , the strategy often needs to be revised online . Models and policies must be adapted . Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence . These include dynamic programming , reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization . Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages .",
  "/wiki/Motion_planning": "Motion planning ( also known as the navigation problem or the piano mover 's problem ) is a term used in robotics is to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the robot from the source to destination . For example , consider navigating a mobile robot inside a building to a distant waypoint . It should execute this task while avoiding walls and not falling down stairs . A motion planning algorithm would take a description of these tasks as input , and produce the speed and turning commands sent to the robot 's wheels . Motion planning algorithms might address robots with a larger number of joints ( e.g. , industrial manipulators ) , more complex tasks ( e.g . manipulation of objects ) , different constraints ( e.g. , a car that can only drive forward ) , and uncertainty ( e.g . imperfect models of the environment or robot ) . Motion planning has several robotics applications , such as autonomy , automation , and robot design in CAD software , as well as applications in other fields , such as animating digital characters , video game , artificial intelligence , architectural design , robotic surgery , and the study of biological molecules .",
  "/wiki/Mechatronics": "Mechatronics , which is also called mechatronic engineering , is a multidisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the engineering of both electrical and mechanical systems , and also includes a combination of robotics , electronics , computer , telecommunications , systems , control , and product engineering . As technology advances over time , various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying . The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields . Originally , the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics and electronics , hence the name being a portmanteau of mechanics and electronics ; however , as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve , the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas . The word mechatronics originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori , an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation . The word mechatronics was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of 46-32714 in 1971 . However , the company later released the right to use the word to public , whereupon the word began being used across the world . Nowadays , the word is translated into many languages and the word is considered an essential term for industry . French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition : approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics , electronics , control theory , and computer science within product design and manufacturing , in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality . Many people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword synonymous with robotics and electromechanical engineering ."
