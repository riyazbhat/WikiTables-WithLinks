  "/wiki/Armoured_Recovery_Vehicle": "An armoured recovery vehicle ( ARV ) is typically a powerful tank or armoured personnel carrier ( APC ) chassis modified for use during combat for towing or repair of battle-damaged , stuck , and/or inoperable armoured fighting vehicles , such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) . Most ARVs have motorized tracks , like a tank or bulldozer , enabling the ARV to operate on uneven ground . The term Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle ( ARRV ) is also used . ARVs may have winches , jibs , cranes , and/or bulldozer blades to aid in tank recovery . Typically , any specialized lifting and recovery equipment replaces the turret and cannon found on a regular tank . ARVs may in some cases have electric generators , blowtorches , chainsaws and fuel pumps to help with recovery operations , or spare parts , to facilitate field repairs . Some ARVs have a spade component to anchor the vehicle when it is towing or lifting . Since most ARVs are based on tank or APC chassis , they have an armored crew cockpit and engine , which means that ARVs can be operated in combat conditions . Rarely , an ARV may be armed , such as some M32s , which have an 81 mm mortar for screening purposes , and the M88 , which has a .50 cal heavy machine gun . One WWII Sherman-based ARV had a dummy gun installed where the turret would normally go . Early ARVs in WWII were often repurposed tanks , with the turret and cannon removed and replaced with some type of winch . In the 2010s , ARVs are generally factory-built .",
  "/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia": "The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) , also known as SFR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia , was a country located in Central and Southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars . Covering an area of 255,804 km\u00b2 ( 98,766 sq mi ) , the SFRY was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west , Austria and Hungary to the north , Bulgaria and Romania to the east , and Albania and Greece to the south . The nation was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and made up of six socialist republics - Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia - with Belgrade as its capital . In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation . The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s ; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics .",
  "/wiki/T-55": "The T-54 and T-55 tanks are a series of Soviet main battle tanks introduced in the years following the Second World War . The first T-54 prototype was completed at Nizhny Tagil by the end of 1945 . Initial production ramp up settled for 1947 at Nizhny Tagil , and 1948 for Kharkiv were halted and curtailed as many problems were uncovered ; the T-34-85 still accounted for 88 percent of production through the 1950s . The T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army , armies of the Warsaw Pact countries , and many others . T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world 's armed conflicts since the later part of the 20th century . The T-54/55 series eventually became the most-produced tank in military history . Estimated production numbers for the series range from 86,000 to 100,000 . They were replaced by the T-62 , T-64 , T-72 , T-80 and T-90 tanks in the Soviet and Russian armies , but remain in use by up to 50 other armies worldwide , some having received sophisticated retrofitting . During the Cold War , Soviet tanks never directly faced their NATO adversaries in combat in Europe . However , the T-54/55 's first appearance in the West around the period of the 1950s ( then the beginning of the Cold War ) spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun , the Royal Ordnance L7 , and the United States to develop the M60 Patton .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/Armoured_vehicle-launched_bridge": "An armoured vehicle-launched bridge ( AVLB ) is a combat support vehicle , sometimes regarded as a subtype of military engineering vehicle , designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles across gap-type obstacles , such as ( and primarily ) rivers . The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of weapons . The AVLB 's job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross craters , anti-tank ditches , blown bridges , railroad cuts , canals , rivers and ravines ) , when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached , and no bridge is conveniently located ( or sufficiently sturdy , a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks ) . The bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo , providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes . Once the span has been put in place , the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge , and moves aside to allow traffic to pass . Once all of the vehicles have crossed , it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side . It then retracts the span ready to move off again . A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions . AVLBs can carry bridges of 60 feet ( 19 metres ) or greater in length . By using a tank chassis , the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as main battle tanks , and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire . However , this is not a universal attribute : some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications .",
