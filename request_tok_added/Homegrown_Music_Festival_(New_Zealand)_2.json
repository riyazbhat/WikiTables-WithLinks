  "/wiki/Antiform": "In structural geology , an anticline is a type of fold that is an arch-like shape and has its oldest beds at its core . A typical anticline is convex up in which the hinge or crest is the location where the curvature is greatest , and the limbs are the sides of the fold that dip away from the hinge . Anticlines can be recognized and differentiated from antiforms by a sequence of rock layers that become progressively older toward the center of the fold . Therefore , if age relationships between various rock strata are unknown , the term antiform should be used . The progressing age of the rock strata towards the core and uplifted center , are the trademark indications for evidence of anticlines on a geologic map . These formations occur because anticlinal ridges typically develop above thrust faults during crustal deformations . The uplifted core of the fold causes compression of strata that preferentially erodes to a deeper stratigraphic level relative to the topographically lower flanks . Motion along the fault including both shortening and extension of tectonic plates , usually also deforms strata near the fault . This can result in an asymmetrical or overturned fold .",
