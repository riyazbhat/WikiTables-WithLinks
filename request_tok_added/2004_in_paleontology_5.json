  "/wiki/Silurian": "The Silurian ( ) is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period , at million years ago ( Mya ) , to the beginning of the Devonian Period , Mya . The Silurian is the shortest period of the Paleozoic Era . As with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period 's start and end are well identified , but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years . The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major Ordovician-Silurian extinction events when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out . A significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed fish and bony fish . Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small , bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes , streams , and coastlines , and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian . However , terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian .",

Since its independence , Latvia has been referred to as one of the Baltic states . It is bordered by Estonia to the north , Lithuania to the south , Russia to the east , Belarus to the southeast , and shares a maritime border with Sweden to the west . Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a democratic sovereign state , parliamentary republic and a very highly developed country according to the United Nations Human Development Index .",
  "/wiki/Acanthodii": "Acanthodii or acanthodians ( sometimes called spiny sharks ) is a paraphyletic class of teleostome fish , sharing features with both bony fish and cartilaginous fish . In form they resembled sharks , but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans ( gars , bowfins ) . They represent several independent phylogenetic branches of fishes leading to the still extant Chondrichthyes . The popular name spiny sharks is a partial misnomer for these early jawed fishes . The name was coined because they were superficially shark-shaped , with a streamlined body , paired fins , and a strongly upturned tail ; stout , largely immovable bony spines supporting all the fins except the tail - hence , spiny sharks ; in retrospect , however , their close relation to modern cartilaginous fish can lead them to be considered stem-sharks . Fossilized spines and scales are often all that remains of these fishes in ancient sedimentary rocks . Although not sharks or cartilaginous fish , acanthodians did , in fact , have a cartilaginous skeleton , but their fins had a wide , bony base and were reinforced on their anterior margin with a dentine spine . The earliest acanthodians were marine , but during the Devonian , freshwater species became predominant . There are three orders recognized : Climatiiformes , Ischnacanthiformes and Acanthodiformes . Climatiiforma had shoulder armor and many small sharp spines , Ischnacanthiforma with teeth fused to the jaw , and the Acanthodiforma were filter feeders , with no teeth in the jaw , but long gill rakers . Overall , the acanthodians ' jaws are presumed to have evolved from the first gill arch of some ancestral jawless fishes that had a gill skeleton made of pieces of jointed cartilage . Paraphyletic groupings are problematic , as one can not talk precisely about their phylogenic relationships , their characteristic traits and literal extinction .",

  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Osteichthyes": "Osteichthyes ( ) , popularly referred to as the bony fish , is a diverse taxonomic group of fish that have skeletons primarily composed of bone tissue , as opposed to cartilage . The vast majority of fish are members of Osteichthyes , which is an extremely diverse and abundant group consisting of 45 orders , and over 435 families and 28,000 species . It is the largest class of vertebrates in existence today . The group Osteichthyes is divided into the ray-finned fish ( Actinopterygii ) and lobe-finned fish ( Sarcopterygii ) . The oldest known fossils of bony fish are about 420 million years old , which are also transitional fossils , showing a tooth pattern that is in between the tooth rows of sharks and bony fishes . Osteichthyes can be compared to Euteleostomi . In paleontology , the terms are synonymous . In ichthyology , the difference is that Euteleostomi presents a cladistic view which includes the terrestrial tetrapods that evolved from lobe-finned fish , whereas prior to 2014 the view of most ichthyologists was that Osteichthyes includes only fishes , and were therefore paraphyletic . However , in 2014 , an ichthyology paper was published with phylogenetic trees that treat the Osteichthyes as a clade including tetrapods .",
  "/wiki/Estonia": "Estonia ( Estonian : Eesti [ \u02c8e\u02d0s\u02b2ti ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Estonia ( Estonian : Eesti Vabariik ) , is a country on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe . It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland with Finland on the other side , to the west by the Baltic Sea with Sweden on the other side , to the south by Latvia ( 343 km ) , and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia ( 338.6 km ) . The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland and of 2,222 islands in the Baltic Sea , covering a total area of 45,227 km2 ( 17,462 sq mi ) , water 2,839 km2 ( 1,096 sq mi ) , land area 42,388 km2 ( 16,366 sq mi ) , and is influenced by a humid continental climate . The official language of the country , Estonian , is the second-most-spoken Finnic language . The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 BC . Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile . In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule , resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991 .",
  "/wiki/Devonian": "The Devonian ( ) is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic , spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian , million years ago ( Mya ) , to the beginning of the Carboniferous , Mya . It is named after Devon , England , where rocks from this period were first studied . The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian . Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land , forming extensive forests which covered the continents . By the middle of the Devonian , several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots , and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared . Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established . Fish reached substantial diversity during this time , leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the Age of Fishes . The placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment . The ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates ( tetrapods ) began adapting to walking on land , as their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs . In the oceans , primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and Late Ordovician . The first ammonites , species of molluscs , appeared . Trilobites , the mollusc-like brachiopods and the great coral reefs , were still common .",

Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east .

  "/wiki/Thelodonti": "Thelodonti ( from Greek : feeble teeth ) is a class of extinct jawless fishes with distinctive scales instead of large plates of armor . There is much debate over whether the group of Palaeozoic fish known as the Thelodonti ( formerly coelolepids ) represent a monophyletic grouping , or disparate stem groups to the major lines of jawless and jawed fish . Thelodonts are united in possession of thelodont scales . This defining character is not necessarily a result of shared ancestry , as it may have been evolved independently by different groups . Thus the thelodonts are generally thought to represent a polyphyletic group , although there is no firm agreement on this point . On the basis that they are monophyletic , they are reconstructed as being ancestrally marine and invading freshwater on multiple occasions . Thelodonts were morphologically very similar , and probably closely related , to fish of the classes Heterostraci and Anaspida , differing mainly in their covering of distinctive , small , spiny scales . These scales were easily dispersed after death ; their small size and resilience makes them the most common vertebrate fossil of their time . The fish lived in both freshwater and marine environments , first appearing during the Ordovician , and perishing during the Frasnian-Famennian extinction event of the Late Devonian . Traditionally they were considered predominantly deposit-feeding bottom dwellers , but more recent studies have showed they occupied various ecological roles in various parts of the water column , much like modern bony fishes and sharks . In particular , a large variety of species preferred reef ecosystems , and it has been suggested that this preference was the reason for the development of their unique scales , protecting against abrasion and allowing for the development of more flexible bodies than other jawless fish , which had inflexible armors and were restricted to open habitats .",
