  "/wiki/Canadians": "Canadians ( French : Canadiens ) are people identified with the country of Canada . This connection may be residential , legal , historical or cultural . For most Canadians , many ( or all ) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Canadian . Canada is a multilingual and multicultural society home to people of groups of many different ethnic , religious , and national origins , with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants . Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization , different waves ( or peaks ) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today . Elements of Indigenous , French , British , and more recent immigrant customs , languages , and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada , and thus a Canadian identity . Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic , geographic , and economic neighbour - the United States . Canadian independence from the United Kingdom grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867 . World War I and World War II in particular , gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship . Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1 , 1947 , and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982 . Canada 's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom . Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians ' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development .",
  "/wiki/English_Canadians": "English Canadians or Anglo-Canadians ( ) , refers to either Canadians of English ethnic origin and heritage or to English-speaking or Anglophone , Canadians of any ethnic origin ; it is used primarily in contrast with French Canadians .

They or their ancestors came from various European , Asian , Caribbean , African , Latin American , and Pacific Island cultures , as well as French Canada and North American Aboriginal groups . As such , although the office of the Governor General is said to alternate between French and English persons , two recent Governors General ( Adrienne Clarkson , an English-speaking Chinese Canadian ; and Micha\u00eblle Jean , a French-speaking Haitian Canadian ) show that this refers to language and not culture or ethnicity .
