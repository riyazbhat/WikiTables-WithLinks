  "/wiki/Venezuela_national_football_team": "The Venezuela national football team ( ) represents Venezuela in men 's international association football and is controlled by the Venezuelan Football Federation ( FVF ) , the governing body for football in Venezuela . It is nicknamed La Vinotinto ( Red wine ) because of the traditional burgundy color of their shirts . When playing at home in official games , they usually rotate between three stadiums : The Polideportivo Cachamay in Puerto Ordaz , the Estadio Jos\u00e9 Antonio Anzo\u00e1tegui in Puerto La Cruz and the Estadio Pueblo Nuevo in San Crist\u00f3bal . In friendly matches , they tend to rotate between the rest of the stadiums in the country . Unlike other South American nations , and akin to some Caribbean nations , baseball is extremely popular in Venezuela , which diverts athletic talent away from football , contributing to its historic lack of success in CONMEBOL competitions . As of 2018 , they are the only CONMEBOL side to have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup . Often Venezuela would go through entire qualification tournaments without recording a single win , although this has not happened since 1998 . Until 2011 , their best finish in the Copa Am\u00e9rica was fifth in their first entry , in 1967 . It is only recently with the spread of the World Cup 's popularity in nations where football was not the primary sport ( such as Japan , the United States , and Australia ) that the national team found incentives to increase player development and fan support . As of September 2019 , Venezuela has the highest position on the FIFA World Ranking of any team that has not yet qualified for the World Cup , being ranked 26th . In spite of its lackluster senior performance , Venezuela has been notable for being the first country from outside the three traditional CONMEBOL forces ( Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay ) to reach the final of any FIFA competition , with its U-20 team achieved the feat in 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup .",
