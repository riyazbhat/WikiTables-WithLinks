  "/wiki/Security_officer": "A security guard ( also known as a security inspector , security officer , or protective agent ) is a person employed by a government or private party to protect the employing partys assets ( property , people , equipment , money , etc . ) from a variety of hazards ( such as waste , damaged property , unsafe worker behavior , criminal activity such as theft , etc . ) by enforcing preventative measures . Security guards do this by maintaining a high-visibility presence to deter illegal and inappropriate actions , looking ( either directly , through patrols , or indirectly , by monitoring alarm systems or video surveillance cameras ) for signs of crime or other hazards ( such as a fire ) , taking action to minimize damage ( such as warning and escorting trespassers off property ) , and reporting any incidents to their clients and emergency services ( such as the police or paramedics ) , as appropriate . Security officers are generally uniformed to represent their lawful authority to protect private property . Security guards are generally governed by legal regulations , which set out the requirements for eligibility ( e.g. , a criminal record check ) and the permitted authorities of a security guard in a given jurisdiction . The authorities permitted to security guards vary by country and subnational jurisdiction . Security officers are hired by a range of organizations , including businesses , government departments and agencies and not-for-profit organizations ( e.g. , churches and charitable organizations ) . Until the 1980s , the term watchman was more commonly applied to this function , a usage dating back to at least the Middle Ages in Europe where there was no form of law enforcement ( other than it being a private matter ) . This term was carried over to North America where it was interchangeable with night-watchman [ e.g . security guard ] until both terms were replaced with the modern security-based titles . Security officers are sometimes regarded as fulfilling a private policing function .",

  "/wiki/Portrait_painting": "Portrait painting is a genre in painting , where the intent is to represent a specific human subject . The term 'portrait painting ' can also describe the actual painted portrait . Portraitists may create their work by commission , for public and private persons , or they may be inspired by admiration or affection for the subject . Portraits are often important state and family records , as well as remembrances . Historically , portrait paintings have primarily memorialized the rich and powerful . Over time , however , it became more common for middle-class patrons to commission portraits of their families and colleagues . Today , portrait paintings are still commissioned by governments , corporations , groups , clubs , and individuals . In addition to painting , portraits can also be made in other media such as prints ( including etching and lithography ) , photography , video and digital media . It might seem obvious that a painted portrait is intended to achieve a likeness of the sitter that is recognisable to those who have seen them , and ideally is a very good record of their appearance . In fact this concept has been slow to grow , and it took centuries for artists in different traditions to acquire the distinct skills for painting a good likeness .",

  "/wiki/Yoga_as_exercise": "Yoga as exercise is a physical activity consisting mainly of postures ( asanas ) , often connected by flowing sequences called vinyasas , sometimes accompanied by rhythmic breathing ( pranayama ) , and often ending with relaxation ( lying down in savasana ) or meditation . Yoga in this form has become familiar across the world , especially in America and Europe . It is derived from medieval Ha\u1e6dha yoga , and is sometimes so named , but it is generally simply called yoga . This is despite the existence of multiple older traditions of yoga within Hinduism dating back to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali , some not involving asanas at all , and despite the fact that in no tradition was the practice of asanas central . Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names , including modern postural yoga , modern transnational yoga , and transnational anglophone yoga . Asana practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including Yogendra and Kuvalayananda , who emphasised its health benefits . The flowing sequences of Salute to the Sun , Surya Namaskar , were pioneered by the Rajah of Aundh , Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi , in the 1920s . Surya Namaskar and many standing poses used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by Krishnamacharya in Mysore from the 1930s to the 1950s . Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga : Pattabhi Jois created Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga , which in turn led to Power Yoga ; B. K. S. Iyengar created Iyengar Yoga , and systematised the canon of asanas in his 1966 book Light on Yoga ; and Indra Devi taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood . Other major schools founded in the 20th century include Bikram Choudhury 's Bikram Yoga and Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh 's Sivananda Vedanta Schools of Yoga . Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe , and then the rest of the world . Some of Ha\u1e6dha yoga 's components like the Satkarmas ( purifications ) , Mudras ( seals or gestures to restrain the Prana or vital principle ) , and pranayama are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise .",
