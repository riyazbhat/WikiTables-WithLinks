  "/wiki/John_Beard_(tenor)": "John Beard ( c. 1716 - 5 February 1791 ) was an English tenor of the 18th century . He is best remembered for creating an extensive number of roles in the operas and oratorios of George Frideric Handel . His d\u00e9but came in Handel 's 1734 revival of Il pastor fido ( Handel ) , which was a great success . He continued to sing for Handel , creating roles in ten of his operas and performing in every one of Handel 's English-language oratorios , odes , and music dramas , with the sole exception of The Choice of Hercules . He also performed for Thomas Arne , and sang at the Chapel Royal . His marriage , during 1739 , to Lady Henrietta Herbert , only daughter of James Waldegrave , 1st Earl Waldegrave caused much scandal : Lord Egmont commented that there is no prudence below the girdle . Lady Henrietta died in 1753 and in 1759 he married again , this time to Charlotte Rich , whose father was the proprietor of the opera house in Covent Garden . After he ( the father ) , died in 1761 , Beard succeeded to the role until 1767 , when deafness forced him to retire , selling Covent Garden 's ownership for \u00a360,000 . He died at Hampton . Handel created several heroic leading roles for Beard , a revolution in the heyday of the castrato voice . The title roles in Samson , Judas Maccabeus , and Jephtha call for strength and expressive qualities over agility . He also sang the role of Farmer Hawthorne in the world premiere of Thomas Arne 's Love in a Village .",

  "/wiki/Susanna_Maria_Cibber": "Susannah Maria Cibber ( February 1714 - 30 January 1766 ) , also known as Susannah Maria Arne , was a celebrated English singer and actress . She was the sister of the composer Thomas Arne . Although she began her career as a soprano , her voice lowered in the early part of her career to that of a true contralto . She was universally admired for her ability to move her audiences emotionally both as an actress and vocalist . Possessing a sweet , expressive , and agile singing voice with a wide vocal range , Cibber was an immensely popular singer , even if at times her voice was criticized for a lack of polished technique . Charles Burney wrote of her singing that by a natural pathos , and perfect conception of the words , she often penetrated the heart , when others , with infinitely greater voice and skill , could only reach the ear . Cibber was particularly admired by Handel , who wrote numerous parts especially for her including the contralto arias in his 1741 oratorio Messiah , the role of Micah in Samson , the role of Lichas in Hercules and the role of David in Saul among others . In the mid-1730s she began appearing in plays in addition to appearing in operas and oratorios . She became the greatest dramatic actress of the eighteenth-century London stage and at the time of her death was the highest-paid actress in England .",
  "/wiki/Bass_(voice_type)": "A bass ( ) is a type of classical male singing voice and has the lowest vocal range of all voice types . According to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera , a bass is typically classified as having a vocal range extending from around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C ( i.e. , E-E ) . Its tessitura , or comfortable range , is normally defined by the outermost lines of the bass clef . Categories of bass voices vary according to national style and classification system . Italians favour subdividing basses into the basso cantante ( singing bass ) , basso buffo ( funny bass ) , or the dramatic basso profondo ( low bass ) . The American system identifies the bass-baritone , comic bass , lyric bass , and dramatic bass . The German fach system offers further distinctions : Spielbass ( Bassbuffo ) , Schwerer Spielbass ( Schwerer Bassbuffo ) , Charakterbass ( Bassbariton ) , and Seri\u00f6ser Bass . These classification systems can overlap . Rare is the performer who embodies a single fach without also touching repertoire from another category .",
