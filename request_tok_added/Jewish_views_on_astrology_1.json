  "/wiki/Keter": "Keter ( , ke\u1e6fer Crown ) also known as Kether , is the topmost of the Sephirot of the Tree of Life in Kabbalah . Since its meaning is crown , it is interpreted as both the topmost of the Sephirot and the regal crown of the Sephirot . It is between Chokhmah and Binah ( with Chokhmah on the right and Binah in the left ) and it sits above Tiferet . It is usually given three paths , to Chokhmah , Tiferet and Binah . Keter is so sublime , it is called in the Zohar the most hidden of all hidden things , and is completely incomprehensible to man . It is also described as absolute compassion , and Rabbi Moshe Cordovero describes it as the source of the 13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy . Keter is invisible , colorless .",
  "/wiki/Chokhmah_(Kabbalah)": "Chokm\u00e2h ( , \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 ISO 259 or khok-maw ) is the Biblical Hebrew word rendered as wisdom in English Bible versions ( LXX sophia , Vulgate ' ) . The word occurs 149 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible It is cognate with the Arabic word for wisdom , \u1e25ikma ( Semitic root ) . Adjectival wise is used as a honorific , as in Talmid Chacham ( lit . student of a sage ) for a Torah scholar , or hakham Bashi for a chief rabbi . The Talmud ( Shabbat 31a ) describes knowledge of the Talmudic order of Kodshim as a high level of wisdom , chokhmah . In the Kabbalah , Chokhmah is the uppermost of the sephirot of the right line ( kav yamin , the Pillar of Mercy ) in the Tree of Life . It is to the bottom right of Keter , with Binah across from it . Under it are the sephirot of Chesed and Netzach . It commonly has four paths going to Keter , Binah , Tifereth , and Chesed . ( Some kabbalists attribute a path between Chokhmah and Gevurah . )",
  "/wiki/Binah_(Kabbalah)": "Binah ( meaning understanding ; b\u012bn\u0101h ) , is the third sephira on the kabbalistic Tree of Life . It sits on the level below Keter ( in the formulations that include that sephirah ) , across from Chokhmah and directly above Gevurah . It is usually given four paths : to Keter , Chokhmah , Gevurah , and Tiphereth ( some Kabbalists place a path from Binah to Chesed as well . ) Binah is associated with the color black .",
  "/wiki/Chesed": "Chesed ( , also Romanized \u1e25esed ) is a Hebrew word . In its positive sense , the word is used of kindness or love between people , of piety of people towards God as well as of love or mercy of God towards humanity . It is frequently used in Psalms in the latter sense , where it is traditionally translated lovingkindness in English translations . In Jewish theology it is likewise used of God 's love for the Children of Israel , and in Jewish ethics it is used for love or charity between people . Chesed in this latter sense of charity is considered a virtue on its own , and also for its contribution to tikkun olam ( repairing the world ) . It is also considered the foundation of many religious commandments practiced by traditional Jews , especially interpersonal commandments . Chesed is also one of the ten Sephirot on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life . It is given the association of kindness and love , and is the first of the emotive attributes of the sephirot .",
  "/wiki/Gevurah": "Gevurah or geburah ( \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 ) , strength , is the fifth sephirah in the kabbalistic tree of life , and it is the second of the emotive attributes of the sephirot . It sits below Binah , across from Chesed , and above Hod . Gevurah is the essence of judgment ( DIN ) and limitation , and corresponds to awe and the element of fire . In the Bahir it is written And who are the Officers ? We learned that there are three . Strength ( Gevurah ) is the Officer of all the Holy Forms to the left of the Blessed Holy One . He is Gabriel . Gevurah is associated with the color red .",
  "/wiki/Tiferet": "Tiferet ( Adornment , ) alternatively Tifaret , Tifereth , Tyfereth or Tiphereth , is the sixth sefira in the kabbalistic Tree of Life . It has the common association of Spirituality , Balance , Integration , Beauty , Miracles , and Compassion .",
  "/wiki/Netzach": "Netzach ( , eternity ) is the seventh of the ten Sefirot in the Jewish mystical system of Kabbalah . It is located beneath Chesed ( 'loving-kindness ' ) , at the base of the Pillar of Mercy which also consists of Chochmah ( 'wisdom ' ) . Netzach generally translates to 'eternity ' , and in the context of Kabbalah refers to 'perpetuity ' , 'victory ' , or 'endurance ' .",
  "/wiki/Hod_(Kabbalah)": "Hod ( Hebrew howd majesty , splendour , glory ) is the eighth sephira of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life . Hod sits below Gevurah and across from Netzach in the tree of life ; Yesod is to the south-east of Hod . It has four paths , which lead to Gevurah , Tiphereth , Netzach , and Yesod . All the sephirot are likened to different parts of the body , and Netzach and Hod are likened to the two feet of a person i.e . the right and left foot . The feet are usually only the means for a person 's activity . While the hands are the main instrument of action , the feet help bring a person to the place where he wishes to execute that action . Hasidic Judaism 's view of Hod is that it is connected with Jewish prayer . Prayer is seen as form of submission ; Hod is explained as an analogy - that instead of conquering an obstacle in one 's way , ( which is the idea of Netzach ) , subduing oneself to that obstacle is related to the quality of Hod . Hod is where form is given by language in its widest sense , being the key to the mystery of form ( this may be an adoption of a point of view of Jacques Lacan ) . Our unconscious desires come from Netzach , and are given form in the symbolic realm by Hod , manifesting unconsciously through Yesod to Malkuth . Hod is like doing your dirty laundry -Reb Zalman Shachter-Shalomi",
  "/wiki/Yesod_(Kabbalah)": "Yesod ( Hebrew : \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3 foundation ) is a sephirah or node in the kabbalistic Tree of Life , a system of Jewish philosophy . Yesod , located near the base of the Tree , is the sephirah below Hod and Netzach , and above Malkuth ( the kingdom ) . It is seen as a vehicle allowing movement from one thing or condition to another ( the power of connection ) . Yesod , Kabbalah , & the Tree of Life are Jewish concepts adopted by various philosophical systems including Christianity , New Age Eastern-based mysticism , & Western esoteric practices .",
  "/wiki/Malkuth": "Malkuth ( ; Modern : Ashkenazi : , 'kingdom ' ) , Malchut or Malchus is the tenth of the sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life . It sits at the bottom of the Tree , below Yesod . This sephirah has as a symbol the Bride which relates to the sphere of Tipheret , symbolized by the Bridegroom . Unlike the other nine sephirot , it is an attribute of God which does not emanate from God directly . Rather it emanates from God 's creation - when that creation reflects and evinces God 's glory from within itself . The word can be translated or identified as positive communication , royalty/kingly dynasty , or humility ."
