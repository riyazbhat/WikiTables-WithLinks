  "/wiki/Forbidden_Colours": "Forbidden Colours is a 1983 song by David Sylvian and Ryuichi Sakamoto . The song is the vocal version of the theme from the Nagisa Oshima film Merry Christmas , Mr. Lawrence ( in certain territories retitled Furyo ) . It appears on the film 's soundtrack album and was released as a single on Virgin Records in 1983 ( the second collaborative single release by Sylvian and Sakamoto , following 1982 's Bamboo Houses ) . The title of the song is taken from Japanese writer Yukio Mishima 's 1953 novel Forbidden Colors ; although not directly related to the film , both works include exploration of homosexual themes . In 1984 the track was re-recorded and released as the B-side to Red Guitar , the lead single to Sylvian 's first solo album Brilliant Trees and was later also included as a bonus track on certain editions of his 1987 album Secrets of the Beehive . Both Sakamoto and Sylvian have since recorded several interpretations of the song , both instrumental ( under the title Merry Christmas , Mr. Lawrence ) and vocal . An orchestral version featuring vocals by Sylvian was included on Sakamoto 's 1999 album Cinemage .",

Following their breakup , Sylvian embarked on a solo career with his debut album Brilliant Trees ( 1984 ) . His solo work has been described by AllMusic as far-ranging and esoteric , and has included collaborations with artists such as Ryuichi Sakamoto , Robert Fripp , Holger Czukay , and Fennesz .",

  "/wiki/Iggy_Pop": "James Newell Osterberg Jr. ( born April 21 , 1947 ) , better known as Iggy Pop , is an American singer , songwriter , musician , record producer , and actor . Designated the Godfather of Punk , he was the vocalist of influential proto-punk band the Stooges , who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited multiple times since . Initially playing a raw , primitive style of rock and roll , the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances , which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop . He had a long collaborative and personal friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career , beginning with the Stooges ' album Raw Power in 1973 . With both musicians having relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions , Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums The Idiot and Lust for Life . Throughout his career , Pop is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics and distinctive voice . He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity . Pop , who traditionally ( but not exclusively ) performs bare-chested , also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd . Pop 's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career , including garage rock , punk rock , hard rock , art rock , new wave , jazz , blues , and electronic . Though his popularity has fluctuated through the years , many of Pop 's songs have become well known , including Search and Destroy and I Wan na Be Your Dog by the Stooges , and his solo hits Lust for Life , The Passenger and Real Wild Child ( Wild One ) . In 1990 , he recorded his first and only Top 40 U.S. hit , Candy , a duet with B-52 's singer Kate Pierson . Although Pop has had limited commercial success , he has remained both a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres .",
