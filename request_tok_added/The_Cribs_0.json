  "/wiki/ASCAP": "The American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers ( ASCAP /\u02c8\u00e6sk\u00e6p/ ) is an American non-profit performance-rights organization ( PRO ) that protects its members ' musical copyrights by monitoring public performances of their music , whether via a broadcast or live performance , and compensating them accordingly . ASCAP collects licensing fees from users of music created by ASCAP members , then distributes them back to its members as royalties . In effect , the arrangement is the product of a compromise : when a song is played , the user does not have to pay the copyright holder directly , nor does the music creator have to bill a radio station for use of a song . In 2012 , ASCAP collected over US $ 941 million in licensing fees and distributed $ 828.7 million in royalties to its members , with an 11.6 percent operating expense ratio . As of July 2018 , ASCAP membership included over 670,000 songwriters , composers , and music publishers , with over 11 million registered works . In the United States , ASCAP competes with other PROs , including BMI , SESAC , and SoundExchange .",

The 2001 event , was somewhat notoriously notable for Phill Jupitus stretching out the time it took to announce the Best Producer award , with him exclaiming Best Producer ? . 'Would you like a cowbell in that ? ' , before being told off camera to get on with announcing the winner . The Q Awards have included many awards recognising a lifetime of achievement , rather than achievements over the year in question .
