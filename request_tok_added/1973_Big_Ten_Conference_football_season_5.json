  "/wiki/Guard_(American_football)": "In gridiron football , a guard ( G ) is a player who lines up between the center and the tackles on the offensive line of a football team on the line of scrimmage used primarily for blocking . Right guards ( RG ) is the term for the guards on the right of the offensive line , while left guards ( LG ) are on the left side . Guards are to the right or left of the center . The guard 's job is to protect the quarterback from the incoming linemen during pass plays , as well as creating openings ( holes ) for the running backs to head through .

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",
