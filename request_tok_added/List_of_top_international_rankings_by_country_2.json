  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",
  "/wiki/Pear": "The pear ( /\u02c8p\u025b\u0259r/ ) tree and shrub are a species of genus Pyrus /\u02c8pa\u026ar\u0259s/ , in the family Rosaceae , bearing the pomaceous fruit of the same name . Several species of pear are valued for their edible fruit and juices while others are cultivated as trees . The tree is medium-sized and native to coastal as well as mildly temperate regions of Europe , north Africa and Asia . Pear wood is one of the preferred materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture . About 3000 known varieties of pears are grown worldwide . The fruit is consumed fresh , canned , as juice , and dried . In 2017 , world production of pears was 24 million tonnes , with China as the main producer .",
  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",
  "/wiki/Vegetable_oil": "Vegetable oils , or vegetable fats , are oils extracted from seeds , or less often , from other parts of fruits . Like animal fats , vegetable fats are mixtures of triglycerides . Soybean oil , rapeseed oil , and cocoa butter are examples of fats from seeds . Olive oil , palm oil , and rice bran oil are examples of fats from other parts of fruits . In common usage , vegetable oil may refer exclusively to vegetable fats which are liquid at room temperature . Vegetable oils are usually edible ; non-edible oils derived mainly from petroleum are termed mineral oils .",
  "/wiki/Beef": "Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle , particularly skeletal muscle . Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times . Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients . Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts , such as roasts , short ribs or steak ( filet mignon , sirloin steak , rump steak , rib steak , rib eye steak , hanger steak , etc . ) , while other cuts are processed ( corned beef or beef jerky ) . Trimmings , on the other hand , are usually mixed with meat from older , leaner ( therefore tougher ) cattle , are ground , minced or used in sausages . The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage . Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal , such as the oxtail , liver , tongue , tripe from the reticulum or rumen , glands ( particularly the pancreas and thymus , referred to as sweetbread ) , the heart , the brain ( although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy , BSE , commonly referred to as mad cow disease ) , the kidneys , and the tender testicles of the bull ( known in the United States as calf fries , prairie oysters , or Rocky Mountain oysters ) . Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is , but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings . The bones are used for making beef stock . Meat from younger cows ( calves ) is called veal . Beef from steers and heifers is similar .",
  "/wiki/Consumption_(economics)": "Consumption , defined as spending for acquisition of utility , is a major concept in economics and is also studied in many other social sciences . It is seen in contrast to investing , which is spending for acquisition of future income . Different schools of economists define consumption differently . According to mainstream economists , only the final purchase of newly produced goods and services by individuals for immediate use constitutes consumption , while other types of expenditure - in particular , fixed investment , intermediate consumption , and government spending - are placed in separate categories ( see Consumer choice ) . Other economists define consumption much more broadly , as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design , production and marketing of goods and services ( e.g . the selection , adoption , use , disposal and recycling of goods and services ) . Economists are particularly interested in the relationship between consumption and income , as modeled with the consumption function .",
  "/wiki/Association_football": "Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , [ a ] is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players . It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies , making it the world 's most popular sport . The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end . The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal . Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The ball is 68-70 cm ( 27-28 in ) in circumference and known as the football . The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other team 's goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks . Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play , except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area . Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball , but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms . The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins .",
  "/wiki/Sport": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",

  "/wiki/Geography": "Geography ( from Greek : \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 , geographia , literally earth description ) is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands , features , inhabitants , and phenomena of the Earth and planets . The first person to use the word \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 was Eratosthenes ( 276-194 BC ) . Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities - not merely where objects are , but also how they have changed and come to be . Geography is often defined in terms of two branches : human geography and physical geography . Human geography deals with the study of people and their communities , cultures , economies , and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place . Physical geography deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere , hydrosphere , biosphere , and geosphere . The four historical traditions in geographical research are spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena , area studies of places and regions , studies of human-land relationships , and the Earth sciences . Geography has been called the world discipline and the bridge between the human and the physical sciences ."
