  "/wiki/Midwife": "A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery . The education and training for a midwife is similar to that of a nurse , in contrast to obstetricians and perinatologists who are physicians ( doctors ) . In many countries , midwifery is either a branch of nursing or has some links to nursing such as a shared regulatory body , though others regard them as entirely separate professions . Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal . They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques . For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife 's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries , they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons . In many parts of the world , these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women . In others , only the midwife is available to provide care , and in yet other countries , many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives . Many developing countries are investing money and training for midwives , sometimes by upskilling those people already practicing as traditional birth attendants . Some primary care services are currently lacking , due to a shortage of funding for these resources .",
