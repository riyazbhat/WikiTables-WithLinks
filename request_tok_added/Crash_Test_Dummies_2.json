  "/wiki/Juno_Awards_of_1992": "The Juno Awards of 1992 , representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year , were awarded on 29 March 1992 in Toronto at a ceremony in the O'Keefe Centre . Rick Moranis was the host for the ceremonies , which were broadcast on CBC Television from 9 pm Eastern . Nominations were announced 12 February 1992 . Bryan Adams was nominated in 7 categories to set a Juno record , while Tom Cochrane received nominations in 6 . Adams sparked controversy in the Canadian music industry several months earlier when he openly criticised Canadian content regulations when his album project , Waking Up the Neighbours , was disqualified as Canadian for radio airplay purposes . That album was created largely with the help of non-Canadian producer Robert John Mutt Lange , therefore the songs fell below the legal Canadian content threshold . However , Adams qualified for the 1992 Juno nominations as an individual Canadian citizen . The 1992 Juno Awards thus became viewed as a showdown between Adams and Tom Cochrane , as the latter met Canadian content requirements . When all the 1992 Juno Awards were presented , Tom Cochrane was the major winner with 4 Junos , compared to 3 for Adams . 1992 's awards also featured an unprecedented three-way tie for winners in the Best Jazz Album category .",
