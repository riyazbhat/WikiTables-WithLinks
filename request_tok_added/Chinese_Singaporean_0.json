Its capital is Fuzhou , while its largest city by population is Xiamen , both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province . The name Fujian came from the combination of Fuzhou and Jianzhou ( present Nanping ) , a city in Fujian , during the Tang dynasty . While its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin , it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China . Historically the dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province , including the Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian . This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province 's name ( \u95a9 ) . Hakka Chinese is also spoken , by the Hakka people in Fujian . Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese . Due to emigration , a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia and Philippines speak Southern Min ( or Hokkien ) . As a result of the Chinese Civil War , Historical Fujian is now divided between the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and the Republic of China ( ROC , Taiwan ) , and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions .

Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 .
