  "/wiki/St_Mary_and_St_Michael's_Church,_Great_Urswick": "St Mary and St Michael 's Church is in the village of Great Urswick , Cumbria , England . It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness , the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness , and the diocese of Carlisle . Its benefice is united with those of St Cuthbert , Aldingham , St Matthew , Dendron , and St Michael , Rampside . These churches are part of a group known as the Low Furness Group of Parishes . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Perpendicular_Gothic": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Niche_(architecture)": "A niche ( , or ) in classical architecture is an exedra or an apse that has been reduced in size , retaining the half-dome heading usual for an apse . Nero 's Domus Aurea ( AD 64-69 ) was the first semi-private dwelling that possessed rooms that were given richly varied floor plans , shaped with niches and exedras ; sheathed in dazzling polished white marble , such curved surfaces concentrated or dispersed the daylight . The word derives from the Latin nidus or nest , via the French niche . The Italian nicchio for a sea-shell may also be involved , as the traditional decoration for the top of a niche is a scallop shell , as in the illustration , hence also the alternative term of conch for a semi-dome , usually reserved for larger exedra . In Gothic architecture , a niche may be set within a tabernacle framing , like a richly decorated miniature house ( aedicule ) , such as might serve for a reliquary . The backings for the altars in churches ( reredos ) can be embedded with niches for statues . Though a niche in either Classical or Gothic contexts may be empty and merely provide some articulation and variety to a section of wall , the cult origins of the niche suggested that it be filled with a statue . One of the earliest buildings which uses external niches containing statues is the Church of Orsanmichele in Florence , built between 1380 and 1404 . The Uffizi Palace in Florence ( 1560-81 ) modified the concept by setting the niche within the wall so it did not protrude . The Uffizi has two dozen or so such niches containing statues of great historical figures . In England the Uffizi style niches were adopted at Montacute House ( c. 1598 ) , where there are nine exterior niches containing statues of the Nine Worthies . In Fra Filippo Lippi 's Madonna , the trompe-l'oeil niche frames her as with the canopy of estate that was positioned over a personage of importance in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern Europe .",
  "/wiki/Piet\u00e0": "A piet\u00e0 ( Italian pronunciation : [ pje\u02c8ta ] ; meaning pity , compassion ) is a subject in Christian art depicting the Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus , most often found in sculpture . As such , it is a particular form of the Lamentation of Christ , a scene from the Passion of Christ found in cycles of the Life of Christ . When Christ and the Virgin are surrounded by other figures from the New Testament , the subject is strictly called a lamentation in English , although piet\u00e0 is often used for this as well , and is the normal term in Italian .",
  "/wiki/Coping_(architecture)": "Coping ( from cope , Latin capa ) consists of the capping or covering of a wall . A splayed or wedge coping slopes in a single direction ; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point . A coping may consist of stone ( capstone ) , brick , clay or terracotta , concrete or cast stone , tile , slate , wood , thatch , or various metals , including aluminum , copper , stainless steel , steel , and zinc . In all cases it should be weathered ( have a slanted or curved top surface ) to throw off the water . Various types of copings exist . A diagrammatic explanation of copper copings is available . In Romanesque work copings appeared plain and flat , and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip . In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering ( mainly on the outer side ) , and began at the top with an astragal ; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off ; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section , and the coping mouldings continued round the sides , as well as at top and bottom , mitring at the angles , as in many of the colleges at Oxford .",
  "/wiki/Embattled": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",

  "/wiki/Roughcast": "Roughcast or pebbledash is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand , small gravel , and often pebbles or shells . The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop . The idea is to maintain an even spread , free from lumps , ridges or runs and without missing any background . Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix , whereas pebbledashing adds them on top . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910-1911 ) , roughcast used to be a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings , but it is now frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses , especially those built using timber framing ( half timber ) . Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours , and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded . Though it is an occasional home-design fad , its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5% . However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland , with a high percentage of new houses still being built with roughcasting . [ citation needed ] This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s , when housing was in greater demand , and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could , and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work , which also added rudimentary weather protection . Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building materials needed , although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all , but small and sharp flint chips , and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash . There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar , sharp-dash , sharpstone dash , thrown dash , pebble stucco , Derbyshire Spar , Yellow spar , golden gravel , black and white , and also sunflower . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition , the central tower of St Albans Cathedral , built with Roman tiles from Verulamium , was covered with roughcast believed to be as old as the building .",

  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",
  "/wiki/Lintel_(architecture)": "A lintel or lintol is a structural horizontal block that spans the space or opening between two vertical supports . It can be a decorative architectural element , or a combined ornamented structural item . It is often found over portals , doors , windows and fireplaces . In the case of windows , the bottom span is instead referred to as a sill , but , unlike a lintel , does not serve to bear a load to ensure the integrity of the wall . Modern day lintels are made using prestressed concrete and are also referred to as beams in beam and block slabs or ribs in rib and block slabs . These prestressed concrete lintels and blocks are components that are packed together and propped to form a suspended floor concrete slab .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",

  "/wiki/Fanlight": "A fanlight is a window , often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape , with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan . It is placed over another window or a doorway , and is sometimes hinged to a transom . The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst . It is also called a sunburst light .",
  "/wiki/Hood_mould": "In architecture , a hood mould , label mould ( from Latin labia , lip ) , drip mould or dripstone , is an external moulded projection from a wall over an opening to throw off rainwater . This moulding can be terminated at the side by ornamentation called a label stop . The hood mould was introduced into architecture in the Romanesque period , though they became much more common in the Gothic period . Later , with the increase in rectangular windows they became more prevalent in domestic architecture .",
  "/wiki/Dormer": "A dormer is a roofed structure , often containing a window , that projects vertically beyond the plane of a pitched roof . A dormer window is a form of roof window . Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane . The term dormer is commonly used to refer to a dormer window although a dormer does not necessarily contain a window . A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion . As a prominent element of many buildings , different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture . When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals , it is usually referred to as a lucarne .",
  "/wiki/Sundial": "A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky . In the narrowest sense of the word , it consists of a flat plate ( the dial ) and a gnomon , which casts a shadow onto the dial . As the Sun appears to move across the sky , the shadow aligns with different hour-lines , which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day . The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon , though a single point or nodus may be used . The gnomon casts a broad shadow ; the shadow of the style shows the time . The gnomon may be a rod , wire , or elaborately decorated metal casting . The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth 's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year . The style 's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial 's geographical latitude . In a broader sense , a sundial is any device that uses the Sun 's altitude or azimuth ( or both ) to show the time . In addition to their time-telling function , sundials are valued as decorative objects , literary metaphors , and objects of intrigue and mathematical study . A rudimentary sundial can be easily constructed to mark the passing of time by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals . It is common for inexpensive , mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons , shadow lengths , and hour-lines , which can not be adjusted to tell correct time .",
  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

  "/wiki/Finial": "A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object , often formed to be a decorative feature . In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies .

It is traditionally made from solid milled wood or plaster , but may be of plastic or reformed wood . In classical architecture and sculpture , the molding is often carved in marble or other stones . A plain molding has right-angled upper and lower edges . A sprung molding has upper and lower edges that bevel towards its rear , allowing mounting between two non-parallel planes ( such as a wall and a ceiling ) , with an open space behind . Moldings may be decorated with paterae as long , uninterrupted elements may be boring for eyes .",
