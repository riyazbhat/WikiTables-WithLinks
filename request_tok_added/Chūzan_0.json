He is said to have taken power after defeating a usurper to the throne by the name of Riy\u016b who had overthrown the 25th chief of the Tenson Dynasty .",
  "/wiki/Shunbajunki": "Shunbajunki 's reign is noted for the construction of Shuri Castle , and the introduction of the Japanese kana writing system . The Chinese language and writing system was not to be introduced until roughly a century later ; even after that time , government documents continued to be written in kana , as did much poetry . Shunbajunki died in 1248 , and was succeeded by his son Gihon .",
  "/wiki/Gihon_(Ryukyu)": "Gihon was the third and last of the Shunten Lineage . He succeeded his father Shunbajunki at the age of 44 , in 1248 . Gihon 's reign was marked by terrible disasters , including famine , epidemics , and devastating typhoons . Around 1254 , he appointed a young lord by the name of Eiso to be Regent ( Sessei ) , and to aid in managing these disasters . When Gihon abdicated in 1259 or 1260 , he withdrew into the forest alone . Eiso succeeded him as king and began a new royal lineage . The precise location , date , and circumstances of Gihon 's death are unknown , though it is safe to assume he died shortly after his abdication . Local legends allege that he was last seen at the cliffs of Hedo Point , the northernmost point on Okinawa Island .",
  "/wiki/Taisei_(Ryukyu)": "He was the second ruler in the Eis\u014d lineage of monarchs ; that is , his father was King Eis\u014d and his son was King Eiji . The years of Taisei 's reign at Shuri were uneventful . Taisei was the grandfather of Tamagusuku , who would become the first monarch of the kingdom of Ch\u016bzan in central Okinawa .",
  "/wiki/Eiji_(Ryukyu)": "He was the third ruler in the Eis\u014d lineage of monarchs ; that is , his grandfather was King Eiso and his father was King Taisei . The five years of Eiji 's reign at Shuri were uneventful , but after his death , the island was split into three polities . Eiji was the father of Tamagusuku , who would become the first monarch of the polity of Ch\u016bzan in central Okinawa .",
  "/wiki/Tamagusuku": "Tamgusuku was a chief of the Okinawan polity of Ch\u016bzan from roughly 1314-1336 . He was the third son of Eiji ( r. 1309-1313 ) , he was the fourth ruler of the lineage of Eiso ( r. 1260-1299 ) . Succeeding his father Eiji as paramount chief of Okinawa 's territorial lords at the age of nineteen , Tamagusuku lacked the charisma and leadership skills to command respect and loyalty from those lords ( the anji ) . A number of these lords rebelled , and the island of Okinawa came to be divided into three kingdoms . Tamagusuku , remaining in Urasoe , became the chief of Ch\u016bzan . His failure to institute reforms or innovations in governance is generally claimed as one of the causes of the fall of the lineage ( dynasty ) , which ended with Tamagusuku 's son and successor Seii . The Lord of \u014czato fled south from Tamagusuku 's capital at Urasoe and , along with his followers , formed the polity of Nanzan ( \u5357\u5c71 , Southern Mountain ) . The Lord of Nakijin , based some distance to the north , declared himself chief of Hokuzan ( \u5317\u5c71 , Northern Mountain ) . He was succeeded by his only son Seii .",
  "/wiki/Seii_(Ryukyu)": "Seii ( \u897f\u5a01 ) ( c. 1326 - 1349 ) was the second king of the Okinawan kingdom of Ch\u016bzan . He succeeded his father , Tamagusuku , in 1336 , at the age of ten . His reign is characterized by the meddling of his mother in government affairs , and her corruption . The king 's mother took advantage of her privileges and position , and severely damaged popular support for her son . Seii died in 1349 . The Governor of Urasoe , Satto , seized power for himself .",
  "/wiki/Satto": "Satto ( \u5bdf\u5ea6 ) ( c. 1320 - 1395 ) , also known as Chadu , was a chief of Ch\u016bzan , one of three polities formerly on the island of Okinawa . His reign was marked by expansion and development of Ch\u016bzan 's trade relations with other states , and the beginning of Okinawa 's tributary relations with Ming Dynasty China , a relationship that continued for roughly five hundred years , almost until the fall of the Qing Dynasty . Satto was Governor of the Urasoe district , which surrounded and included Ch\u016bzan 's capital . On the death of chief Seii in 1350 , Satto seized the throne for himself . His own line , or dynasty , however , did not last past his son , Bunei , who was ousted in 1405 . Chinese envoys arrived in Ch\u016bzan in 1372 , requesting admission of Chinese cultural supremacy and that Okinawa send representatives to Nanjing . Satto complied with these requests without hesitation , as this granted him formal license to trade with the most powerful nation in the region . He sent his younger brother Taiki ( \u6cf0\u671f ) to Nanjing in 1374 , as the leader of a mission to formally submit to China , entering into tributary and trade relations . The Hongwu Emperor entertained the Ryukyuan mission , accepted their gifts , and sent them back with various gifts from China , including a royal seal , which served as a symbol of investiture . A Chinese official accompanied the returning mission , and represented the Imperial Court in officially confirming Satto as chief of Okinawa . Though Okinawa was never conquered or annexed by China , this custom of investiture , of formally confirming the chief in the eyes of the Chinese court , continued as part of tributary relations until the dismantling of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom five centuries later . There were at least nine tributary missions to China over the next twenty years , three of them led by Taiki .",
  "/wiki/Bunei_(Ryukyu)": "Bunei ( \u6b66\u5be7 ) ( r. 1398-1406 ) , also known as Wuning , was the last chief of Ch\u016bzan , one of three polities on the island of Okinawa , before it was united into the Ryukyu Kingdom by Sh\u014d Hashi .",
  "/wiki/Sh\u014d_Shish\u014d": ", also known as Talumei , was Anji of Sashiki and later chief of Ch\u016bzan , one of three polities on the island of Okinawa , before they were united . He was the progenitor of what became the First Sh\u014d Dynasty . The son of Shish\u014d was Sh\u014d Hashi , who is known as the first king of the Ryukyu Kingdom . Sh\u014d Hashi overthrew chief Bunei of Ch\u016bzan in 1406 and installed his father as king . His kingship was acknowledged by the Yongle Emperor of China , who caused a diplomatic mission to be sent to the Ryukyuan capital in 1415 . On 30 January 1406 , the Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the Ryukyuans castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace . The emperor said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration , and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again ."
