  "/wiki/New_Year's_Day": "New Year 's Day , also simply called New Year , is observed on 1 January , the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar . In pre-Christian Rome under the Julian calendar , the day was dedicated to Janus , god of gateways and beginnings , for whom January is also named . As a date in the Gregorian calendar of Christendom , New Year 's Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus , which is still observed as such in the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church . The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary , Mother of God . In present day , with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their de facto calendar , New Year 's Day is among the most celebrated public holidays in the world , often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight as the new year starts in each time zone . Other global New Year 's Day traditions include making New Year 's resolutions and calling one 's friends and family .",
  "/wiki/Gregorian_Calendar": "The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world . It is named after Pope Gregory XIII , who introduced it in October 1582 . The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425 days long , approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined by the Earth 's revolution around the Sun . The rule for leap years is : Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year , except for years that are exactly divisible by 100 , but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400 . For example , the years 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 are not leap years , but the years 1600 and 2000 are . The calendar was developed as a correction to the Julian calendar , shortening the average year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the equinoxes . To deal with the 10 days ' difference ( between calendar and reality ) that this drift had already reached , the date was advanced so that 4 October 1582 was followed by 15 October 1582 . There was no discontinuity in the cycle of weekdays or of the Anno Domini calendar era . The reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter ( computus ) , restoring it to the time of the year as originally celebrated by the early Church . The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe and their overseas possessions . Over the next three centuries , the Protestant and Eastern Orthodox countries also moved to what they called the Improved calendar , with Greece being the last European country to adopt the calendar in 1923 . To unambiguously specify a date during the transition period , ( or in history texts ) , dual dating is sometimes used to specify both Old Style and New Style dates ( abbreviated as O.S and N.S .",
  "/wiki/Easter": "Easter , also called Pascha ( Greek , Latin ) or Resurrection Sunday , is a festival and holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead , described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day after his burial following his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary 30 AD . It is the culmination of the Passion of Jesus , preceded by Lent ( or Great Lent ) , a 40-day period of fasting , prayer , and penance . Most Christians refer to the week before Easter as Holy Week , which contains the days of the Easter Triduum , including Maundy Thursday , commemorating the Maundy and Last Supper , as well as Good Friday , commemorating the crucifixion and death of Jesus . In Western Christianity , Eastertide , or the Easter Season , begins on Easter Sunday and lasts seven weeks , ending with the coming of the 50th day , Pentecost Sunday . In Eastern Christianity , the season of Pascha begins on Pascha and ends with the coming of the 40th day , the Feast of the Ascension . Easter and the holidays that are related to it are moveable feasts which do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars which follow only the cycle of the Sun ; rather , its date is offset from the date of Passover and is therefore calculated based on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar . The First Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) established two rules , independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity , which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the council . No details for the computation were specified ; these were worked out in practice , a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies .

  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",
  "/wiki/Jesus_Christ": "Jesus [ e ] ( c. 4 BC - c. AD 30 / 33 ) , also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ , [ f ] was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader . He is the central figure of Christianity . Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah ( the Christ ) prophesied in the Old Testament . Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , [ g ] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus . [ h ] [ i ] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry . He preached orally and was often referred to as rabbi . Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God , engaged in healings , taught in parables and gathered followers . He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , turned over to the Roman government , and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect . After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the early Church . Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Christian Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , from where he will return . Most Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God . The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection , an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology .",

  "/wiki/Spiritual_Baptist": "The Spiritual Baptist faith is a syncretic Afro-American religion that combines elements of traditional African religion with Christianity . Despite the African influences , Spiritual Baptists consider themselves to be Christians . The Baptist faith was brought to Trinidad by the Merikins , former American slaves who were recruited by the British to fight , as the Corps of Colonial Marines , against the Americans during the War of 1812 . After the end of the war , these ex-slaves were settled in Trinidad , to the east of the Mission of Savannah Grande ( now known as Princes Town ) in six villages , since then called the Company Villages . These American settlers brought with them the Baptist faith of the Second Great Awakening combined with , in the case of those from Georgia , the Gullah culture . With the coming of missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society from Great Britain , the Baptist faith in the Company Villages was much affected , but despite the ensuing schism between the so-called London Baptists and the rest , the Baptist congregations of the Company Villages , even including those with Gullah origins , retained so little visible African influence in their practice that John Hackshaw was able to give a different view of the Baptists in the north of the country : The faith expanded to Barbados in 1957 as the Sons of God Apostolic Spiritual Baptists movement . It now ranks as one of two indigenous religions in the country , the other being the Rastafari religion . Archbishop Granville Williams , who was born in Barbados , lived for 16 years in Trinidad and Tobago , where he witnessed the local Spiritual Baptists . Becoming enthusiastic about the Trinidadian movement , he asserted that he had seen a vision and heard the voice of God . Upon returning to Barbados he held the first open-air meeting in Oistins , Christ Church . Due to a well received response in Barbados , he quickly established the Jerusalem Apostolic Spiritual Baptist Church in Ealing Grove . This church was quickly followed by Zion at Richmond Gap .",
  "/wiki/Corpus_Christi_(feast)": "The Feast of Corpus Christi also known in Liturgical Latin as Dies Sanctissimi Corporis et Sanguinis Domini Iesu Christi ( Latin for Day of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Jesus Christ the Lord , also known as Solemnity of the Corpus Christi ) is a Christian liturgical solemnity celebrating the Real Presence of the Body and Blood , Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ in the elements of the Eucharist . Two months earlier , the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is observed on Maundy Thursday in a sombre atmosphere leading to Good Friday . The liturgy on that day also commemorates Christ 's washing of the disciples ' feet , the institution of the priesthood and the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane . The feast of Corpus Christi was proposed by St. Thomas Aquinas , Doctor of the Church to Pope Urban IV ; in order to create a feast focused solely on the Holy Eucharist , emphasizing the joy of the Eucharist being the Body and Blood , Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ . Having recognized the authenticity of the Eucharistic Miracle of Bolsena on input of Aquinas , in 1264 , the pontiff , then living in Orvieto , established the feast of Corpus Christi as a Solemnity and extended it to the whole Roman Catholic Church . The feast is liturgically celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday or , where the Solemnity of The Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ is not a holy day of obligation , it is assigned to the Sunday after the Most Holy Trinity as its proper day . At the end of Holy Mass , there is often a procession of the Blessed Sacrament , generally displayed in a monstrance . The procession is followed by Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament . A notable Eucharistic procession is that presided over by the Pope each year in Rome , where it begins at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran and passes to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major , where it concludes with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament . The celebration of the feast was suppressed in Protestant churches during the Reformation for theological reasons : outside Lutheranism , which maintained the confession of the Real Presence , Protestants denied the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist other than as a merely symbolic or spiritual presence . Today , most Protestant denominations do not recognize the feast day . The Church of England abolished it in 1548 as the English Reformation progressed , but later reintroduced it .",
  "/wiki/Holy_Eucharist": "The Eucharist ( ; also called Holy Communion or the Lord 's Supper among other names ) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches , and as an ordinance in others . According to the New Testament , the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper ; giving his disciples bread and wine during a Passover meal , Jesus commanded his followers to do this in memory of me while referring to the bread as my body and the cup of wine as the new covenant in my blood . Through the eucharistic celebration Christians remember both Christ 's sacrifice of himself on the cross and his commission of the apostles at the Last Supper . The elements of the Eucharist , sacramental bread ( leavened or unleavened ) and sacramental wine ( or by some grape juice ) , are consecrated on an altar ( or a communion table ) and consumed thereafter . Communicants , those who consume the elements , may speak of receiving the Eucharist as well as celebrating the Eucharist . Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite , though they differ about exactly how , where , and when Christ is present . While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the appearances of the elements ( smell , taste , color , weight , fragility , nutritional effects , etc . ) , Roman Catholics believe that their substances actually become the body and blood of Christ ( transubstantiation ) while the appearances or species of the elements remain . Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present in , with , and under the forms of the bread and wine ( sacramental union ) . Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist . Anglican eucharistic theologies universally affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a spiritual presence , while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship believe this is a corporeal presence . Others , such as the Plymouth Brethren , take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper and a memorial .",

Indenturees usually enter into an indenture for a specific payment or other benefit ( such as transportation to a new place ) , or to meet a legal obligation , such as debt bondage . On completion of the contract , indentured servants were given their freedom , and occasionally plots of land . Indentured servitude was often brutal , with a high percentage of servants dying prior to the expiration of their indentures .

  "/wiki/Trade_union": "A trade union ( or a labor union in the U.S. ) is an association of workers forming a legal unit or legal personhood , usually called a bargaining unit , which acts as bargaining agent and legal representative for a unit of employees in all matters of law or right arising from or in the administration of a collective agreement . Labour unions typically fund the formal organization , head office , and legal team functions of the labour union through regular fees or union dues . The delegate staff of the labour union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections . Today , unions are usually formed for the purpose of securing improvement in pay , benefits , working conditions , or social and political status through collective bargaining by the increased bargaining power wielded by the banding of the workers . The trade union , through an elected leadership and bargaining committee , bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ( rank and file members ) and negotiates labour contracts ( collective bargaining ) with employers . The most common purpose of these associations or unions is maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment . This may include the negotiation of wages , work rules , occupational health and safety standards , complaint procedures , rules governing status of employees including promotions , just cause conditions for termination , and employment benefits . Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ( craft unionism ) , a cross-section of workers from various trades ( general unionism ) , or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ( industrial unionism ) . The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers . Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning . Originating in Great Britain , trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution . Trade unions may be composed of individual workers , professionals , past workers , students , apprentices or the unemployed .",

  "/wiki/Republic": "A republic ( Latin : res publica , meaning public affair ) is a form of government in which the country is considered a public matter , not the private concern or property of the rulers . The primary positions of power within a republic are attained , through democracy , oligarchy , autocracy , or a mix thereof , rather than being unalterably occupied . As such it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and has therefore no monarch as head of state . In the context of American constitutional law , the definition of republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body [ better source needed ] and exercise power according to the rule of law under a constitution , including separation of powers with an elected head of state , referred to as a constitutional republic or representative democracy . As of 2017 [ update ] , 159 of the world 's 206 sovereign states use the word republic as part of their official names - not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments , nor is the word republic used in the names of all nations with elected governments . The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica , which literally means public thing , public matter , or public affair and was used to refer to the state as a whole . The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic , lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC . This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats and wielding significant influence ; several popular assemblies of all free citizens , possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws ; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority . Most often a republic is a single sovereign state , but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics , or that have governments that are described as republican in nature .

This religious Eid is the first and only day in the month of Shawwal during which Muslims are not permitted to fast . The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities , so the day of celebration varies by locality . Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat ( Islamic prayer ) that consists of two rakats ( units ) generally performed in an open field or large hall . It may only be performed in congregation ( jam\u0101\u02bfat ) and features six additional Takbirs ( raising of the hands to the ears while saying All\u0101hu \u02beAkbar , meaning God is the greatest ) in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam : three at the start of the first rakat and three just before ruk\u016b\u02bf in the second rakat . Other Sunni schools usually have twelve Takbirs , similarly split in groups of seven and five . In Shia Islam , the salat has six Takbirs in the first rakat at the end of qira ' a , before ruk\u016b\u02bf , and five in the second . Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality , this salat is either far\u1e0d \u0641\u0631\u0636 ( obligatory ) , musta\u1e25abb \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0628 ( strongly recommended ) or mand\u016bb \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0628 ( preferable ) .",

A commemoration of Muhammad 's first revelation , [ citation needed ] the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days , from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next . Fasting from sunrise to sunset is fard ( obligatory ) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill , travelling , elderly , pregnant , breastfeeding , diabetic , or menstruating . The predawn meal is referred to as suhur , and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar . Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca , it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day . The spiritual rewards ( thawab ) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan . Accordingly , Muslims refrain not only from food and drink , but also tobacco products , sexual relations , and sinful behavior , devoting themselves instead to salat ( prayer ) , recitation of the Quran , and the performance of charitable deeds [ citation needed ] as they strive for purity and heightened awareness of God ( taqwa ) .

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",
  "/wiki/Islamic_calendar": "The Islamic calendar ( ' ) , also known as the Hijri , Lunar Hijri , Muslim or Arabic calendar , is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days . It is used to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals , such as the annual period of fasting and the proper time for the pilgrimage to Mecca . The civil calendar of almost all countries where the religion is predominantly Muslim is the Gregorian calendar , with Syriac month-names used in the Levant and Mesopotamia ( Iraq , Syria , Jordan , Lebanon and Palestine ) . Notable exceptions to this rule are Iran and Afghanistan , which use the Solar Hijri calendar . Rents , wages and similar regular commitments are generally paid by the civil calendar . The Islamic calendar employs the Hijri era whose epoch was established as the Islamic New Year of 622 AD/CE . During that year , Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina and established the first Muslim community ( ummah ) , an event commemorated as the Hijra . In the West , dates in this era are usually denoted AH ( , in the year of the Hijra ) in parallel with the Christian ( AD ) , Common ( CE ) and Jewish eras ( AM ) . In Muslim countries , it is also sometimes denoted as H from its Arabic form ( , abbreviated ) . In English , years prior to the Hijra are reckoned as BH ( Before the Hijra ) . The current Islamic year is 1441 AH . In the Gregorian calendar , 1441 AH runs from approximately 1 September 2019 to 20 August 2020 .",

  "/wiki/Hinduism": "Hinduism is the world 's third largest religion . It is an Indian religion and dharma , or way of life , [ note 1 ] widely practised in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia . Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world , [ note 2 ] and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as San\u0101tana Dharma , the eternal tradition , or the eternal way , beyond human history . Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion [ note 3 ] or synthesis [ note 4 ] of various Indian cultures and traditions , [ note 5 ] with diverse roots [ note 6 ] and no founder . This Hindu synthesis started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE , after the end of the Vedic period ( 1500 to 500 BCE ) , and flourished in the medieval period , with the decline of Buddhism in India . Although Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies , it is linked by shared concepts , recognisable rituals , cosmology , shared textual resources , and pilgrimage to sacred sites . Hindu texts are classified into \u015aruti ( heard ) and Sm\u1e5bti ( remembered ) . These texts discuss theology , philosophy , mythology , Vedic yajna , Yoga , agamic rituals , and temple building , among other topics . Major scriptures include the Vedas and the Upanishads , the Puranas , the Mahabharata , the Ramayana , and the \u0100gamas . Sources of authority and eternal truths in its texts play an important role , but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the understanding of these truths and to further develop the tradition .

  "/wiki/Christmas_Day": "Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions , Christmastide includes an octave . Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world 's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians , as well as culturally by many non-Christians , and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it . The traditional Christmas narrative , the Nativity of Jesus , delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies . When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city , the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born , with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information . Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25 . This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar . Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar . For Christians , believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than knowing Jesus ' exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian , and secular themes and origins . Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving ; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath ; Christmas music and caroling ; viewing a Nativity play ; an exchange of Christmas cards ; church services ; a special meal ; and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly .",

  "/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations": "The Commonwealth of Nations , generally known simply as the Commonwealth , is a political association of 54 member states , mostly former territories of the British Empire . The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat , which focuses on intergovernmental aspects , and the Commonwealth Foundation , which focuses on non-governmental relations between member states . The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was originally created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , and formalised by the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which modernised the community and established the member states as free and equal . The human symbol of this free association is the Head of the Commonwealth , currently Queen Elizabeth II , and the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting appointed Charles , Prince of Wales to be her designated successor , although the position is not technically hereditary . The Queen is the head of state of 16 member states , known as the Commonwealth realms , while 33 other members are republics and five others have different monarchs . Member states have no legal obligations to one another , but are connected through their use of the English language and historical ties . Their stated shared values of democracy , human rights and the rule of law are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games . The countries of the Commonwealth cover more than 29,958,050 km2 ( 11,566,870 sq mi ) , equivalent to 20% of the world 's land area , and span all six inhabited continents ."
