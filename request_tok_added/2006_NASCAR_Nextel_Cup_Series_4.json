  "/wiki/Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo": "The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe that was manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet from 1970 to 2007 model years ( non-continuously ) , encompassing six generations . Chevrolet positioned the Monte Carlo as a personal luxury car , with the last generation classified as a full-sized coup\u00e9 . The first four generations of the Monte Carlo ( 1970-1972 , 1973-1977 , 1978-1980 , and 1981-1988 ) were of a rear-wheel-drive , V8-powered ( a V6 engine from 1978 ) coupe design , using body-on-frame construction . The later rear-wheel-drive generations did not incorporate the trend of uni-body construction that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to satisfy increasing demand for fuel-economy after the 1973 oil crisis and the early 1980s recession . After the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988 , the nameplate was revived in 1994 for the fifth-generation , a front-drive , V6-powered coupe based on the Chevrolet Lumina sedan . The sixth and final-generation Monte Carlo from 1999 was built alongside the Chevrolet Impala , which succeeded the Lumina as Chevrolet 's mid-sized sedan . The Monte Carlo SS was revived from 1999 to 2007 , that was initially powered by 3.8 L V6 ( supercharged in 2004 and 2005 ) and by a 5.3 L V8 for 2006 and 2007 . The car was named for the city Monte Carlo in the Principality of Monaco , specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/Sp\u00e9lugues .",
