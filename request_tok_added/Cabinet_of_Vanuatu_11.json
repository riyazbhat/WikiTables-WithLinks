The party was launched on 11 November 2010 and is led by MP Ralph Regenvanu . The party aims to produce a generational change in Vanuatu 's leadership and is concerned about foreign ownership of businesses . Upon launching the party , Regenvanu -a popular , young and independent Member of Parliament- reportedly described chiefs , churches , women and youth as the four solid legs of the party . He also stated that prospective GJP candidates for parliamentary election would be severely tested on their record of community service , to ensure that all GJP MPs were committed to defending the public interest . Subsequently , Regenvanu said his party advocated against people selling their land to investors and thereby depriving their children and descendants of that asset . It also supported a greater use of the customary judicial system , where chiefs act as mediators , rather than the Western system , which Regenvanu said often implied significant financial costs for litigants . ( See the article on the law of Vanuatu . ) A month after launching the party , Regenvanu was appointed Minister of Cooperatives and ni-Vanuatu Business Development in the Cabinet of new Prime Minister Sato Kilman . The party obtained four seats in Parliament in the October 2012 general election , the first national election it contested . Regenvanu was subsequently appointed Minister for Lands in the government headed by his ally Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil ( of the Green Confederation ) . As Minister for Lands , Regenvanu -who described himself as a notorious critic of free trade and foreign ownership of lands- introduced a proposal whereby land leases would necessarily be examined by a committee , thus depriving the ministry itself of the power to lease lands without any external controls .",
