  "/wiki/Riverina": "The Riverina is an agricultural region of South-Western New South Wales ( NSW ) , Australia . The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains , warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation . This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia . Bordered on the south by the state of Victoria and on the east by the Great Dividing Range , the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee drainage zones to their confluence in the west . Home to Aboriginal groups for over 40,000 years , the Riverina was originally colonised by Europeans in the mid-19th century as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond . In the 20th century , the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes . The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria , and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies . Major population and service centres in the Riverina include the cities of Wagga Wagga , Leeton and Griffith . Wagga Wagga is home to a campus of Charles Sturt University , the only local provider of higher education for the region . Wagga Wagga is home to two major Australian Defence Force establishments .",
