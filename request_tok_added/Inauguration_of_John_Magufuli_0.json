Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland , Botswana adopted its name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966 . Since then , it has been a representative republic , with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections and the lowest perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998 . It is currently Africa 's oldest continuous democracy. , Botswana is topographically flat , with up to 70 percent of its territory being the Kalahari Desert . It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast , Namibia to the west and north , and Zimbabwe to the northeast . Its border with Zambia to the north near Kazungula is poorly defined but is , at most , a few hundred metres long . A mid-sized country of just over 2.3 million people , Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world . Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city , Gaborone . Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world - with a GDP per capita of about US $ 70 per year in the late 1960s - Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the world 's fastest-growing economies . The economy is dominated by mining , cattle , and tourism . Botswana boasts a GDP ( purchasing power parity ) per capita of about $ 18,825 per year as of 2015 [ update ] , which is one of the highest in Africa . Its high gross national income ( by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa ) gives the country a relatively high standard of living and one of the highest Human Development Index of continental Sub-Saharan Africa .",

Eastern DR Congo has been the scene of ongoing military conflict in Kivu , since 2015 . Centred on the Congo Basin , the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was reached by the Bantu expansion about 3,000 years ago . In the west , the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries . In the centre and east , the kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century . In the 1870s , just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa , European exploration of the Congo Basin was carried out , first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of Leopold II of Belgium . Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Berlin Conference in 1885 and made the land his private property , naming it the Congo Free State . During the Free State , his colonial military unit , the Force Publique , forced the local population to produce rubber . From 1885 to 1908 , millions of the Kongo people died as a consequence of disease and exploitation .",

Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language .

After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 .

  "/wiki/Robert_Mugabe": "Robert Gabriel Mugabe ( /m\u028a\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0bi/ ; Shona : [ mu\u0261a\u0253e ] ; 21 February 1924 - 6 September 2019 ) was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017 . He served as Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party , the ZANU - Patriotic Front ( ZANU-PF ) , from 1980 to 2017 . Ideologically an African nationalist , during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist-Leninist , and as a socialist after the 1990s . His policies have been described as Mugabeism . Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama , Southern Rhodesia . Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare , he worked as a school teacher in Southern Rhodesia , Northern Rhodesia , and Ghana . Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire , Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority . After making anti-government comments , he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974 . On release , he fled to Mozambique , established his leadership of ZANU , and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War , fighting Ian Smith 's predominately white government . He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement , putting an end to the war . In the 1980 general election , Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory . As Prime Minister of the newly renamed Zimbabwe , Mugabe 's administration expanded healthcare and education and - despite his professed desire for a socialist society - adhered largely to mainstream , conservative economic policies ."
