  "/wiki/Compulsory_dance": "The Compulsory dance ( CDs ) , now called the pattern dance , is a part of the figure skating segment of ice dance competitions in which all the couples or solo dancers perform the same standardized steps and holds to music of a specified tempo and genre . One or more compulsory dances were usually skated as the first phase of ice dancing competitions . The 2009-10 season was the final season in which the segment was competed in International Skating Union ( ISU ) junior and senior level competition . In June 2010 , the ISU replaced the name compulsory dance with pattern dance for ice dancing , and merged it into the short dance beginning in the 2010-2011 figure skating season . The first CDs were developed during the 1930s by teams from Great Britain , who dominated ice dance for most of the early years after the sport was contested at the World Championships in 1952 . The CD 's prominence in ice dance slowly declined , until it was removed and replaced by the short dance ( SD ) in 2011 , the same year the ISU voted to follow the structure of ice dance competitions by eliminating the CD and original dance ( OD ) and include the SD and free dance ( FD ) . Ice dancers performed the same pattern around the rink once or twice , to the same step sequences and the same standardized tempo . The competitors were then scored based on their execution of the various elements of the dance . The CD allowed the judges to compare the technical skills of each dancer .",
  "/wiki/Original_dance": "The original dance ( OD ) was one of the programs performed by figure skaters in ice dance competitions , in which the ice dancers skated a dance of their own creation to dance music they have selected for the designated rhythm ( s ) . It was normally the second of three programs in the competition , sandwiched between the compulsory dance ( CD ) and the free dance ( FD ) . The rhythm ( s ) and type of music required for the OD changed every season , and were selected by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) before the start of the season . The ice dancers were free to choose their own music and choreography ( within the specified constraints ) and to create their own routines . They were judged on a set of required criteria , including skating skills and how well they interpreted the music and the rhythm . The ISU voted in 2010 to discontinue the OD , along with the CD , and to introduce the short dance ( SD ) as a replacement . Accordingly , after the 2009-2010 season , the ice dance competition structure was changed and the original dance was removed from all ISU junior and senior level competitions .",
  "/wiki/Free_dance_(figure_skating)": "The free dance ( FD ) is a segment of an ice dance competition , the second contested . It follows the rhythm dance . Skaters perform a creative dance program blending dance steps and movements expressing the character/rhythm ( s ) of the dance music chosen by the couple . Its duration is 4 minutes for senior ice dancers , and 3.5 minutes for juniors . French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron hold the highest recorded international FD score of 135.82 points .",
