Developed as an advanced version of the I-15 with a retractable undercarriage , the I-153 fought in the Soviet-Japanese combats in Mongolia and was one of the Soviets ' major fighter types in the early years of the Second World War . Three I-153s are still flying .",
  "/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-1": "The Yakovlev Yak-1 ( ) was a World War II Soviet fighter aircraft . Production began in early 1940 . It was a single-seat monoplane with a composite structure and wooden wings . The Yak-1 was a manoeuvrable , fast and competitive aircraft . The composite-wooden structure made it easy to maintain , and the engine proved to be reliable . It formed an essential basis for subsequent developments from the Yakovlev bureau . It was the founder of a family of aircraft , with some 43,000 being built . As a reward , designer Alexander Yakovlev was awarded the Order of Lenin ( Russian : \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 , Orden Lenina ) - the highest decoration bestowed by the Soviet Union - a 100,000 ruble prize , plus a Zis motor car .",
  "/wiki/Bell_P-39_Airacobra": "The Bell P-39 Airacobra was one of the principal American fighter aircraft in service when the United States entered World War II . The P-39 was used by the Soviet Air Force , and enabled individual Soviet pilots to collect the highest number of kills attributed to any U.S. fighter type flown by any air force in any conflict . Other major users of the type included the Free French , the Royal Air Force , the United States Army Air Forces , and the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force . Designed by Bell Aircraft , it had an innovative layout , with the engine installed in the center fuselage , behind the pilot , and driving a tractor propeller with a long shaft . It was also the first fighter fitted with a tricycle undercarriage . Although its mid-engine placement was innovative , the P-39 design was handicapped by the absence of an efficient turbo-supercharger , preventing it from performing high-altitude work . For this reason it was rejected by the RAF for use over western Europe but adopted by the USSR , where most air combat took place at medium and lower altitudes . Together with the derivative P-63 Kingcobra , the P-39 was one of the most successful fixed-wing aircraft manufactured by Bell .",
  "/wiki/Bell_P-63_Kingcobra": "The Bell P-63 Kingcobra is an American fighter aircraft developed by Bell Aircraft during World War II . Based on the preceding Bell P-39 Airacobra , the P-63 's design incorporated suggestions from P-39 pilots and was superior to its predecessor in virtually all respects . The P-63 was not accepted for combat use by the United States Army Air Forces . However , it was deployed during World War II by the Soviet Air Force , which had also been the most prolific user of the P-39 .",

The MiG-15 was one of the first successful jet fighters to incorporate swept wings to achieve high transonic speeds . In combat over Korea , it outclassed straight-winged jet day fighters , which were largely relegated to ground-attack roles , and was quickly countered by the similar American swept-wing North American F-86 Sabre . When refined into the more advanced MiG-17 , the basic design would again surprise the West when it proved effective against supersonic fighters such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in the Vietnam War of the 1960s . The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the most produced jet aircraft ; in excess of 13,000 were manufactured . Licensed foreign production may have raised the production total to almost 18,000 .

It is an advanced development of the similar looking MiG-15 of the Korean War . The MiG-17 was license-built in China as the Shenyang J-5 and Poland as the PZL-Mielec Lim-6 . MiG-17s first saw combat in 1958 in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis and later proved to be an effective threat against more modern supersonic fighters of the United States in the Vietnam War .

  "/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-27": "The Sukhoi Su-27 ( ; NATO reporting name : Flanker ) is a Soviet-origin twin-engine supermaneuverable fighter aircraft designed by Sukhoi . It was intended as a direct competitor for the large United States fourth-generation fighters such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle , with range , heavy aircraft ordnance , sophisticated avionics and high maneuverability . The Su-27 was designed for air superiority missions , and subsequent variants are able to perform almost all aerial warfare operations . It was designed with the Mikoyan MiG-29 as its complement . The Su-27 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1985 . The primary role was long range air defence against American SAC B-1B and B-52G/H bombers , protecting the Soviet coast from aircraft carriers and flying long range fighter escort for Soviet heavy bombers such as the Tu-95 Bear , Tu-22M Backfire and Tu-160 Blackjack . There are several related developments of the Su-27 design . The Su-30 is a two-seat , dual-role fighter for all-weather , air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions . The Su-33 'Flanker-D ' is a naval fleet defense interceptor for use on aircraft carriers . Further versions include the side-by-side two-seat Su-34 'Fullback ' strike/fighter-bomber variant , and the Su-35 'Flanker-E ' improved air superiority and multi-role fighter .

The aircraft was designed by the Mikoyan design bureau as a replacement for the earlier MiG-25 Foxbat ; the MiG-31 is based on and shares design elements with the MiG-25 . The MiG-31 has the distinction of being one of the fastest combat jets in the world . It continues to be operated by the Russian Air Force and the Kazakhstan Air Force following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The Russian Defence Ministry expects the MiG-31 to remain in service until 2030 or beyond ."
