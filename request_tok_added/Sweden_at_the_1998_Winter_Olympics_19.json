  "/wiki/Canada_at_the_1998_Winter_Olympics": "Canada competed at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . Canada has competed at every Winter Olympic Games . Canada 's biggest story at these games was the failure of the men 's ice hockey team to win a medal . For the first time , Canada 's best players ( professional players from the National Hockey League ) were able to compete at the Olympics , so Canadians had high expectations . The team lost its semi-final game to the Czech Republic when goaltender Dominik Ha\u0161ek stopped all five shots he faced in the tie-breaking shootout . Canada then lost the bronze medal game to Finland . The women 's ice hockey team , on the other hand , captured a silver medal in the first Games to feature the women 's event . For the first time , curling was included as an official event , having been showcased as a demonstration sport at Lillehammer in 1994 , and both Canadian teams reached the podium . Also making the news was Ross Rebagliati 's disqualification for marijuana being found in his system and having his gold medal stripped . The IOC reinstated the medal days later .",

She died in 2000 at 36 of cancer , leaving a legacy that extended outside of curling . Schmirler was honoured posthumously with an induction into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and was awarded the World Curling Freytag Award , which later led to her induction into the World Curling Federation Hall of Fame . In 2019 , Schmirler was named the second greatest Canadian female curler in history ( after Jennifer Jones ) in a TSN poll of broadcasters , reporters and top curlers .
