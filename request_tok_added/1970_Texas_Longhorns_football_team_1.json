  "/wiki/Cotton_Speyrer": "Charles Wayne Speyrer ( born April 29 , 1949 ) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Baltimore Colts and the Miami Dolphins . He played college football at the University of Texas . Speyrer was a first team all state running back at Port Arthur Jefferson High school and a two-time all american receiver at the University of Texas . He is a member of the University of Texas Hall of Honor and the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame and the only player ever named to the Cotton Bowl All-Decade team in two different decades . Speyrer was a key play-maker in what is considered by some to be the most famous drive in Texas history . Texas was fresh off its famed 15-14 come-from-behind victory over No . 2 Arkansas in the 1969 Shootout , and was eager to avoid a letdown over the eighth-ranked Irish in the 1970 Cotton Bowl National Championship game between Notre Dame , featuring Joe Theismann , and the University of Texas at Austin . But the early proceedings had the makings of one of the decade 's biggest upsets when Notre Dame charged out to a 10-0 lead . Starting on their own 24-yard line , the Longhorns embarked upon a fourth-quarter , 17-play march that included a pair of fourth-and-two conversions , the last coming at the Notre Dame 10 when James Street completed a clutch pass to a diving Speyrer that took the Horns to the two . From there , it took three plays before Billy Dale pushed the ball over the goal line to cement UT 's second national title - Texas 21 , Notre Dame 17 . Speyrer is also known for his last minute touchdown catch for a come-from - behind win in the Texas-UCLA game in the fall of 1970 . That victory cemented Texas ' second National Championship year .",
  "/wiki/Wide_receiver": "A wide receiver , also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers , is an offensive position in gridiron football , and is a key player . They get their name because they are split out wide ( near the sidelines ) , farthest away from the rest of the team . Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field . The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist .",
  "/wiki/1971_Washington_Redskins_season": "The 1971 Washington Redskins season was the team 's 40th in the National Football League , and its 35th in Washington , D.C .

Coming into the 1971 season , the team had not made the postseason in 26 years . The Redskins had had only four winning seasons since their last playoff berth in 1945 , the most recent a 7-5-2 campaign in 1969 under Vince Lombardi , who died of colon cancer in September 1970 . Allen was Washington 's fourth head coach in as many seasons . Lombardi succeeded Otto Graham , and assistant Bill Austin took over when Lombardi fell mortally ill in the summer of 1970 , and posted a 6-8 record . Despite a broken left ankle suffered by leading receiver Charley Taylor in a Week 6 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs that forced him to miss the remainder of the season , the Redskins went 9-4-1 , good for second place in the NFC East .

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
  "/wiki/1971_New_York_Jets_season": "The 1971 New York Jets season was the twelfth season for the team and the second in the National Football League .

  "/wiki/Running_back": "A running back ( RB ) is a member of the offensive backfield in gridiron football . The primary roles of a running back are to receive handoffs from the quarterback to rush the ball , and block . There are usually one or two running backs on the field for a given play , depending on the offensive formation . A running back may be a halfback ( in certain contexts also referred to as a tailback ) , a wingback or a fullback . A running back will sometimes be called a feature back if he is the team 's starting running back .",

The Rams started out strong at 4-1-1 , but split their final eight games . Despite sweeping the 49ers on the season , a crucial tie against the Atlanta Falcons in week 2 proved to doom the Rams , because had they beaten Atlanta , they would 've clinched the NFC West by virtue of their sweep over the 49ers . Team owner Dan Reeves died of cancer prior to the season in April .",
  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",
  "/wiki/Offensive_tackle": "Tackle is a playing position in gridiron football . Historically , in the one-platoon system prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , a tackle played on both offense and defense . In the modern system of specialized units , offensive tackle and defensive tackle are separate positions , and the stand-alone term tackle refers to the offensive tackle position only . The offensive tackle ( OT , T ) is a position on the offensive line , left and right . Like other offensive linemen , their job is to block : to physically keep defenders away from the offensive player who has the football and enable him to advance the football and eventually score a touchdown . The term tackle is a vestige of an earlier era of football in which the same players played both offense and defense .",
  "/wiki/Defensive_back": "In gridiron football , defensive backs ( DBs ) are the players on the defensive team who take positions somewhat back from the line of scrimmage ; they are distinguished from the defensive line players and linebackers , who take positions directly behind or close to the line of scrimmage . The defensive backs , in turn , generally are classified into several different specialized positions :",
  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",
