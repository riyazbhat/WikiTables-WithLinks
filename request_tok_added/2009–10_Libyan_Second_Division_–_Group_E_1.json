It is the capital of the Butnan District ( formerly Tobruk District ) and has a population of 120,000 ( 2011 est. ) . Tobruk was the site of an ancient Greek colony and , later , of a Roman fortress guarding the frontier of Cyrenaica . Over the centuries , Tobruk also served as a waystation along the coastal caravan route . By 1911 , Tobruk had become an Italian military post , but during World War II , Allied forces , mainly the Australian 6th Division , took Tobruk on 22 January 1941 . The Australian 9th Division ( The Rats of Tobruk ) pulled back to Tobruk to avoid encirclement after actions at Er Regima and Mechili and reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941 where prolonged fighting against German and Italian forces followed . Although the siege was lifted by Operation Crusader in November 1941 , a renewed offensive by Axis forces under Erwin Rommel the following year resulted in Tobruk being captured in June 1942 and held by the Axis forces until November 1942 , when it was recaptured by the Allies . Rebuilt after World War II , Tobruk was later expanded during the 1960s to include a port terminal linked by an oil pipeline to the Sarir oil field . King Idris of Libya had his palace at Bab Zaytun . Tobruk was traditionally a stronghold of the Senussi royal dynasty and one of the first to rebel against Colonel Gaddafi in the Arab Spring .",
