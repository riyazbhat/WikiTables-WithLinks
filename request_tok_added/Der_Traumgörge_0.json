Its tessitura , or comfortable range , is normally defined by the outermost lines of the bass clef . Categories of bass voices vary according to national style and classification system . Italians favour subdividing basses into the basso cantante ( singing bass ) , basso buffo ( funny bass ) , or the dramatic basso profondo ( low bass ) . The American system identifies the bass-baritone , comic bass , lyric bass , and dramatic bass . The German fach system offers further distinctions : Spielbass ( Bassbuffo ) , Schwerer Spielbass ( Schwerer Bassbuffo ) , Charakterbass ( Bassbariton ) , and Seri\u00f6ser Bass . These classification systems can overlap . Rare is the performer who embodies a single fach without also touching repertoire from another category .",
