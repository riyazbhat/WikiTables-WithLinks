  "/wiki/Taylor_oil_spill": "The 2004 Taylor oil spill is an ongoing spill located in the Gulf of Mexico , around off the coast of the U.S. state of Louisiana , which resulted from the destruction of a Taylor Energy oil platform during Hurricane Ivan , and it is the longest oil spill in U.S. history . It was first brought to public attention when the contamination at the site was noticed in 2010 by those monitoring the nearby Deepwater Horizon oil spill . A later report by the Associated Press in 2015 challenged the estimates of the extent of the leak given by the company and the U.S. Coast Guard , which were then revised to be around 1000 times greater than initially reported . Upper estimates of the spill have been calculated to be as much as of oil lost over the life of the disaster , affecting an area as large as . As of 2018 , it was estimated that 300 to 700 barrels of oil per day are being spilled , making it one of the worst modern oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico by volume . The reserves are likely sufficient for the spill to continue for up to 100 years if it is not contained . Taylor Energy has spent as much as $ 435 million or more decommissioning the site . They contend that nothing further can be done to contain the spill , and that current observations of oil plumes in the area are the result of contaminated sediments , and not an active spill . This has been contradicted by the reports of non-profit groups , the press , and the government .",
