The climate is characterized by mild winters , and warm summers with many hours of sunshine . The island has 11,103 residents , making it the 4th most populated of the Croatian islands . Hvar 's location at the center of the Adriatic sailing routes has long made this island an important base for commanding trade up and down the Adriatic , across to Italy and throughout the wider Mediterranean . It has been inhabited since pre-historic times , originally by a Neolithic people whose distinctive pottery gave rise to the term Hvar culture , and later by the Illyrians . The ancient Greeks founded the colony of Pharos in 384 BC on the site of today 's Stari Grad , making it one of the oldest towns in Europe . They were also responsible for setting out the agricultural field divisions of the Stari Grad Plain , now a UNESCO World Heritage Site . In medieval times , the City of Hvar rose to importance within the Venetian Empire as a major naval base . Prosperity brought culture and the arts , with one of the first public theatres in Europe , nobles palaces and many fine communal buildings . The 16th century was an unsettled time , with the Hvar Rebellion , coastal raids by pirates and the Ottoman army from the mainland , resulting in some unusual fortified buildings on the northern shore to protect the local population .",
