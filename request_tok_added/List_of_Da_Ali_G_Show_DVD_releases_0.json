  "/wiki/DVD_region_code": "DVD ( digital versatile disc ) region codes are a digital rights management technique designed to allow rights holders to control the international distribution of a DVD release , including its content , release date , and price , all according to the appropriate region . This is achieved by way of region-locked DVD players , which will play back only DVDs encoded to their region ( plus those without any region code ) . The American DVD Copy Control Association also requires that DVD player manufacturers incorporate the regional-playback control ( RPC ) system . However , region-free DVD players , which ignore region coding , are also commercially available , and many DVD players can be modified to be region-free , allowing playback of all discs . DVDs may use one code , multiple codes ( multi-region ) , or all codes ( region free ) .",
