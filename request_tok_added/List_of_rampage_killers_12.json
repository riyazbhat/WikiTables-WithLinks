  "/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370": "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ( also known as MH370 or MAS370 ) [ a ] was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport to its destination , Beijing Capital International Airport . The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft last communicated with air traffic control ( ATC ) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea . The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later but was tracked by military radar for another hour , deviating westwards from its planned flight path , crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea . It left radar range 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) northwest of Penang Island in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia . With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead , the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines ' history until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , which was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine four months later . The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines , which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in December 2014 . The search for the missing airplane , which became the most costly in aviation history , focused initially on the South China and Andaman seas , before analysis of the aircraft 's automated communications with an Inmarsat satellite identified a possible crash site somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean . The lack of official information in the days immediately after the disappearance prompted fierce criticism from the Chinese public , particularly from relatives of the passengers ; most people on board Flight 370 were of Chinese origin . Several pieces of marine debris confirmed to be from the aircraft washed ashore in the western Indian Ocean during 2015 and 2016 . After a three-year search across 120,000 square kilometres ( 46,000 sq mi ) of ocean failed to locate the aircraft , the Joint Agency Coordination Centre heading the operation suspended their activities in January 2017 . A second search launched in January 2018 by the private contractor Ocean Infinity also ended without success after six months . The disappearance of Flight 370 has been dubbed one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time .",

Kennedy International Airport , New York City . On October 31 , 1999 , the Boeing 767-300ER operating the route crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about south of Nantucket Island , Massachusetts , killing all 217 passengers and crew on board . Since the crash occurred in international waters , it was investigated by the Ministry of Civil Aviation 's Egyptian Civil Aviation Agency ( ECAA ) and the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) under International Civil Aviation Organization rules . As the ECAA lacked the resources of the NTSB , the Egyptian government asked the American government to have the NTSB handle the investigation . Two weeks after the crash , the NTSB proposed handing the investigation over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , as the evidence they had collected suggested that a criminal act had taken place , and that the crash was intentional rather than accidental . The Egyptian authorities refused to accept the proposal to hand the investigation over to the FBI , and so the NTSB solely continued the investigation . The NTSB found that the probable cause of the accident was the airplane 's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean . The NTSB 's report stated that the impact was a result of the relief first officer 's flight control inputs , but did not determine a specific reason for the relief first officer 's alleged actions . The ECAA concluded that the incident was caused by mechanical failure of the aircraft 's elevator control system . The report suggested several possibilities for the cause of the accident , focusing on the possible failure of one of the right elevator 's power control units .",

The bombing was the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to the September 11 attacks , and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in United States history . A Gulf War veteran , McVeigh sought revenge against the federal government for the 1993 Waco siege that ended in the deaths of 86 people , many of whom were children , exactly two years before the bombing , as well as the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident and American foreign policy . He hoped to inspire a revolution against the federal government , and defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical government . He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses , including the use of a weapon of mass destruction . He was found guilty on all counts in 1997 and sentenced to death . McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11 , 2001 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute , Indiana . His execution was carried out in a considerably shorter time than most inmates awaiting the death penalty , as most convicts on death row in the United States spend an average of 15 years there . Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier were also convicted as conspirators in the plot . Nichols was sentenced to eight life terms for the deaths of eight federal agents , and to 161 life terms without parole by the state of Oklahoma for the deaths of the others .

The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius , shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings , and destroyed or burned 86 cars , causing an estimated $ 652 million worth of damage . Local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations . Until the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States , and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country 's history . Within 90 minutes of the explosion , McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession . Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack ; Nichols was arrested , and within days , both were charged . Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices . McVeigh , a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer , had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building . His co-conspirator , Nichols , had assisted with the bomb 's preparation . Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993 , McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas .",

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed . It was Germanwings ' first fatal crash in the 18-year history of the company . The investigation determined that the crash was caused deliberately by the co-pilot , Andreas Lubitz , who had previously been treated for suicidal tendencies and declared unfit to work by his doctor . Lubitz kept this information from his employer and instead reported for duty . Shortly after reaching cruise altitude and while the captain was out of the cockpit , he locked the cockpit door and initiated a controlled descent that continued until the aircraft impacted a mountainside . In response to the incident and the circumstances of the co-pilot 's involvement , aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in the cockpit at all times .

The cause of the crash was independently investigated by two agencies in two countries : the United States National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) and the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee ( NTSC ) . The NTSB , which had jurisdiction based on Boeing 's manufacture of the aircraft in the United States , investigated the crash under lead investigator Greg Feith . Its investigation concluded that the crash was the result of deliberate flight control inputs , most likely by the captain . The Indonesian NTSC , led by Engineering Professor Oetarjo Diran , was unable to determine a cause of the crash . Another potential factor that led to the crash of the 737 aircraft was the power control unit ( PCU ) that controlled the aircraft 's rudder . The cause of some 737 crashes , such as USAir Flight 427 , had been attributed to the 737 's rudder issues . Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working , and thus not the cause of the crash , a private investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in a state court in Los Angeles , which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB 's and Parker Hannifin 's conclusions , decided that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve inside the PCU , based on forensic findings from an electron microscope which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash .
