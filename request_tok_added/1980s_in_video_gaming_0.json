  "/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.": "Super Mario Bros. [ b ] is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo . The successor to the 1983 arcade game , Mario Bros. , it was released in Japan in 1985 for the Famicom , and in North America and Europe for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) in 1985 and 1987 respectively . Players control Mario , or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode , as they travel the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser . They must traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom , Fire Flower , and Starman . The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a grand culmination of the Famicom team 's three years of game mechanics and programming . The design of the first level , World 1-1 , serves as a tutorial for first-time video gamers on the basic mechanics of platform gameplay . The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a farewell to the Famicom 's cartridge medium in favor of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System , whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years . Super Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time , with praise on its precise controls . It is one of the bestselling games of all time , with more than 40 million physical copies . It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash , and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre . Koji Kondo 's soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games , making music into a centerpiece of game design . The game inspired an expansive franchise including a long-running game series , an animated television series , and a feature film .",
  "/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System": "The Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced , released , and marketed by Nintendo . It is a remodelled export version of the company 's Family Computer [ a ] ( FC ) platform in Japan , commonly known as the Famicom [ b ] , which was launched on July 15 , 1983 . The NES was launched in a test market of New York City on October 18 , 1985 , followed by Los Angeles as a second test market in February 1986 , followed by Chicago and San Francisco , then other top 12 American markets , followed by a full launch across North America and some countries in Europe in September 1986 , followed by Australia and other countries in Europe in 1987 . Brazil saw only unlicensed clones until the official local release in 1993 . The console 's South Korean release was packaged as the Hyundai Comboy [ c ] and distributed by Hyundai Electronics ( now SK Hynix ) . As one of the best-selling gaming consoles of its time , the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 . With the NES , Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers , authorizing them to produce and distribute games for Nintendo 's platform . It had been preceded by Nintendo 's first home video game console , the Color TV-Game , and was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) .",
  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",

  "/wiki/Tetris": "Tetris ( Russian : \u0422\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441 [ \u02c8t\u025btr\u02b2\u026as ] ; portmanteau of tetromino and tennis ) is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov . The first playable version was completed on June 6 , 1984 , while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow . He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- ( the falling pieces contain 4 segments ) and tennis , Pajitnov 's favorite sport . The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once . Tetris was the first game to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States , where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC . The game is a popular use of tetrominoes , the four-element case of polyominoes , which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907 . ( The name for these figures was given by the mathematician Solomon W. Golomb in 1953 . ) The game , or one of its many variants , is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system , as well as on devices such as graphing calculators , mobile phones , portable media players , PDAs , Network music players , and as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes . It has inspired Tetris serving dishes , and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings . While versions of Tetris were sold for a range of 1980s home computer platforms as well as arcades , it was the successful handheld version for the Game Boy , launched in 1989 , that established the game to critics and fans as one of the greatest video games of all time . In January 2010 , it was announced that the games in the franchise had sold over 170 million copies - approximately 70 million physical and 100 million paid mobile downloads - making it the second-best-selling paid-downloaded game of all time behind Minecraft as of October 2018 .",

  "/wiki/Light_gun_shooter": "Light gun shooter , also called light gun game or simply gun game , is a shooter video game genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller . Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets , either antagonists or inanimate objects . Light gun shooters generally feature action or horror themes and some may employ a humorous , parodic treatment of these conventions . These games typically feature on-rails movement , which gives the player control only over aiming ; the protagonist 's other movements are determined by the game . Games featuring this device are sometimes termed rail shooters , though this term is also applied to games of other genres in which on-rails movement is a feature . Some , particularly later , games give the player greater control over movement and in still others the protagonist does not move at all . Light gun shooters employ light gun controllers , so named because they function through the use of light sensors . Mechanical games using light guns had existed since the 1930s , though they operated differently from those used in video games . Throughout the 1970s mechanical games were replaced by electronic video games and in the 1980s popular light gun shooters such as Duck Hunt emerged . The genre was most popular in the 1990s , subsequent to the release of Virtua Cop , the formula of which was later improved upon by Time Crisis . The genre is less popular in the new millennium , as well as being hampered by compatibility issues , but retains a niche appeal for fans of old school gameplay .",

Unlike other Mario games , Super Mario Land is set in Sarasaland , a new environment depicted in line art , and Mario pursues Princess Daisy ( who makes her debut in this game ) . The game also includes two Gradius-style shooter levels .

Super Mario Land was expected to showcase the console until Nintendo of America bundled Tetris with new Game Boys . The game launched alongside the Game Boy first in Japan ( April 1989 ) and later worldwide . Super Mario Land was later rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console in 2011 again as a launch title , which featured some tweaks to the game 's presentation .

The game was first released in North America in October 1988 , and in the PAL region the following year . It has been remade or re-released for several video game consoles . The game is the product of a circle of influences following the breakthrough success of Super Mario Bros. ( 1985 ) . The sequel prototype is based on two cooperative players lifting and throwing each other , lifting and stacking objects , and scrolling the screen upward - a design too complex for the Famicom hardware and with dissatisfying gameplay . This ambitious concept was postponed in favor of a quicker upgrade to the original Super Mario Bros. engine , released in Japan as the notoriously challenging Super Mario Bros. 2 . The Mario team resumed development of the prototype for another interim game , Yume K\u014dj\u014d : Doki Doki Panic ( 1987 ) . Instead of Mario graphics , this advergame was branded with the characters and themes of Fuji Television 's technology expo called Yume K\u014dj\u014d '87 ( lit . Dream Factory ) . Nintendo of America decided Japan 's Super Mario Bros. 2 had gameplay too frustratingly difficult and too similar to Super Mario Bros. to be worth releasing into the recently crashed American market .

The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges .

It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes .

The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1988 , almost two years after its initial release in Japan . The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda , again involving the protagonist , Link , on a quest to save Princess Zelda , who has fallen under a sleeping spell . The Adventure of Link 's emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements was a significant departure from its predecessor .

This eventually changed with the release of The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild in 2017 , which serves as the latest chapter in the overall continuity . The game was a critical and financial success , and introduced elements such as Link 's magic meter and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games , although the role-playing elements , such as experience points , and the platform-style side-scrolling and limited lives have not been used since in canonical games .

It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company , Activision Blizzard , and consists of several subsidiary studios . Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016 . The company was founded as Activision , Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale , California , by former Atari game developers , upset at how they were treated at Atari , to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console . Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name .
