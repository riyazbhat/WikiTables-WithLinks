  "/wiki/Catherine_II_of_Russia": "Catherine II ( ; - ) , most commonly known as Catherine the Great ( ) , born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst , was Empress of Russia from 1762 until 1796 , the country 's longest-ruling female leader . She came to power following a that she organised - resulting in her husband , Peter III , being overthrown . Under her reign , Russia was revitalised ; it grew larger and stronger , and was recognised as one of the great powers of Europe . In her accession to power and her rule of the empire , Catherine often relied on her noble favourites , most notably count Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin . Assisted by highly successful generals such as Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev , and admirals such as Fyodor Ushakov , she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy . In the south , the Crimean Khanate was crushed following victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish wars , and Russia colonised the territories of Novorossiya along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas . In the west , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , ruled by Catherine 's former lover , King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski , was eventually partitioned , with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share . In the east , Russia started to colonise Alaska , establishing Russian America . Catherine reformed the administration of Russian guberniyas , and many new cities and towns were founded on her orders . An admirer of Peter the Great , Catherine continued to modernize Russia along Western European lines . However , military conscription and the economy continued to depend on serfdom , and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labor . This was one of the chief reasons behind several rebellions , including the large-scale Pugachev Rebellion of Cossacks and peasants .",

  "/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin": "Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov ( 22 April 1870 - 21 January 1924 ) , better known by his alias Lenin , was a Russian revolutionary , politician , and political theorist . He served as head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924 . Under his administration , Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party communist state governed by the Russian Communist Party . Ideologically a communist , he developed a variant of Marxism known as Leninism . Born to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in Simbirsk , Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother 's 1887 execution . Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire 's Tsarist government , he devoted the following years to a law degree . He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist . In 1897 , he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years , where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya . After his exile , he moved to Western Europe , where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( RSDLP ) . In 1903 , he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split , leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov 's Mensheviks . Encouraging insurrection during Russia 's failed Revolution of 1905 , he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution , which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism . After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government , he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution , in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime .",

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership , he eventually consolidated power to become the country 's de facto dictator by the 1930s . A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism , Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism-Leninism , while his own policies are known as Stalinism . Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire ( now Georgia ) , Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth . He edited the party 's newspaper , Pravda , and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction via robberies , kidnappings , and protection rackets . Repeatedly arrested , he underwent several internal exiles . After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin 's newly renamed Communist Party , Stalin joined its governing Politburo . Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union 's establishment in 1922 , Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin 's 1924 death . Under Stalin , Socialism in One Country became a central tenet of the party 's dogma .

  "/wiki/Karl_Marx": "Karl Marx ( ; 5 May 1818 - 14 March 1883 ) was a German philosopher , economist , historian , sociologist , political theorist , journalist and socialist revolutionary . Born in Trier , Germany , Marx studied law and philosophy at university . He married Jenny von Westphalen in 1843 . Due to his political publications , Marx became stateless and lived in exile with his wife and children in London for decades , where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and publish his writings , researching in the reading room of the British Museum . His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet , The Communist Manifesto , and the three-volume . His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual , economic and political history , and his name has been used as an adjective , a noun and a school of social theory . Marx 's critical theories about society , economics and politics - collectively understood as Marxism - hold that human societies develop through class struggle . In capitalism , this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes ( known as the bourgeoisie ) that control the means of production and the working classes ( known as the proletariat ) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages . Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism , Marx predicted that , like previous socio-economic systems , capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as socialism . For Marx , class antagonisms under capitalism , owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature , would eventuate the working class ' development of class consciousness , leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless , communist society constituted by a free association of producers . Marx actively pressed for its implementation , arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation . Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and his work has been both lauded and criticised .",
