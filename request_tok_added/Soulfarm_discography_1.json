  "/wiki/Violin": "The violin , sometimes known as a fiddle , is a wooden string instrument in the violin family . Most violins have a hollow wooden body . It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use . Smaller violin-type instruments exist , including the violino piccolo and the kit violin , but these are virtually unused . The violin typically has four strings , usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3 , D4 , A4 , E5 , and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings , though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers ( pizzicato ) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ( col legno ) . Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres . They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition , both in ensembles ( from chamber music to orchestras ) and as solo instruments and in many varieties of folk music , including country music , bluegrass music and in jazz . Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion , with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound . Further , the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures , including Indian music and Iranian music . The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it . The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy , with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection . In Europe , it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music , such as the viola .",
  "/wiki/Lekhah_Dodi": "Lekha Dodi ( ; also transliterated as Lecha Dodi , L'chah Dodi , Lekah Dodi , Lechah Dodi ; Ashkenazic pronunciation : Lecho Dodi ) is a Hebrew-language Jewish liturgical song recited Friday at dusk , usually at sundown , in synagogue to welcome Shabbat prior to the evening services . It is part of the Kabbalat Shabbat ( welcoming of Sabbath ) . Lekhah Dodi means come my beloved , and is a request of a mysterious beloved that could mean either God or one 's friend ( s ) to join together in welcoming Shabbat that is referred to as the bride : likrat kallah ( to greet the [ Shabbat ] bride ) . During the singing of the last verse , the entire congregation rises and turns to the west towards the setting sun ( or toward the entrance to the synagogue ) , to greet Queen Shabbat as she arrives . It was composed in the 16th century by Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz , who was born in Thessaloniki and later became a Safed Kabbalist . As was common at the time , the song is also an acrostic , with the first letter of the first eight stanzas spelling the author 's name . The author draws from the rabbinic interpretation of Song of Songs in which the maiden is seen as a metaphor for the Jews and the lover ( dod ) is a metaphor for God , and from Nevi'im , which uses the same metaphor . The poem shows Israel asking God to bring upon that great Shabbat of Messianic deliverance .

It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound . Since the 18th century , it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family , between the violin ( which is tuned a perfect fifth above ) and the cello ( which is tuned an octave below ) . The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3 , G3 , D4 , and A4 . In the past , the viola varied in size and style , as did its names . The word viola originates from the Italian language . The Italians often used the term : viola da braccio meaning literally : 'of the arm ' . Brazzo was another Italian word for the viola , which the Germans adopted as Bratsche . The French had their own names : cinquiesme was a small viola , haute contre was a large viola , and taile was a tenor . Today , the French use the term alto , a reference to its range . The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony , up until the eighteenth century , taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line . Music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef .",
  "/wiki/Double_bass": "The double bass , or simply the bass ( and numerous other names ) , is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra . It is a standard member of the orchestra 's string section , as well as the concert band , and is featured in concertos , solo , and chamber music in Western classical music . The bass is used in a range of other genres , such as jazz , 1950s-style blues and rock and roll , rockabilly , psychobilly , traditional country music , bluegrass , tango and many types of folk music . The bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff . The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths ( like a viol ) , rather than fifths , with strings usually tuned to E , A , D and G. The instrument 's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate , with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family . The double bass is played with a bow ( arco ) , or by plucking the strings ( pizzicato ) , or via a variety of extended techniques . In orchestral repertoire and tango music , both arco and pizzicato are employed . In jazz , blues , and rockabilly , pizzicato is the norm . Classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument , as does traditional bluegrass . In jazz , blues , and related genres , the bass is frequently amplified .",
  "/wiki/Accordion": "Accordions ( from 19th-century German Akkordeon , from Akkord - musical chord , concord of sounds ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type , colloquially referred to as a squeezebox . A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist . The concertina and bandone\u00f3n are related ; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family . The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys , causing pallets to open , which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel , called reeds . These vibrate to produce sound inside the body . Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument 's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block . [ notes 1 ] The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual , and the accompaniment , consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons , on the left-hand manual . The accordion is widely spread across the world . In some countries ( for example Brazil , Colombia , Dominican Republic , Mexico and Panama ) it is used in popular music ( for example Gaucho , Forr\u00f3 and Sertanejo in Brazil , Vallenato in Colombia , and norte\u00f1o in Mexico ) , whereas in other regions ( such as Europe , North America and other countries in South America ) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and is often used in folk music in Europe , North America and South America .

  "/wiki/The_Byrds": "The Byrds /b\u025c\u02d0rdz/ were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles , California in 1964 . The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence , with frontman Roger McGuinn ( known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967 ) remaining the sole consistent member . Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles , the Beach Boys , and the Rolling Stones for a short period in the mid-1960s , the Byrds are today considered by critics to be nearly as influential as those bands . Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn 's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar was absorbed into the vocabulary of rock and has continued to be influential . Initially , the band pioneered the musical genre of folk rock as a popular format in 1965 , by melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music on their debut album and the hit singles Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! . As the 1960s progressed , the band was influential in originating psychedelic rock and raga rock , with their song Eight Miles High and the albums Fifth Dimension ( 1966 ) , Younger Than Yesterday ( 1967 ) and The Notorious Byrd Brothers ( 1968 ) . They also played a pioneering role in the development of country rock , with the 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo representing their fullest immersion into the genre . The original five-piece lineup of the Byrds consisted of Jim McGuinn ( lead guitar , vocals ) , Gene Clark ( tambourine , vocals ) , David Crosby ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) , Chris Hillman ( bass guitar , vocals ) , and Michael Clarke ( drums ) . This version of the band was relatively short-lived ; by early 1966 , Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group .

  "/wiki/Mandolin": "A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mando\u02c8li\u02d0no ] ; literally small mandola ) is a stringed musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are typically tuned in a succession of perfect fifths , with the same tuning as a violin . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass . There are many styles of mandolin , but three are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top - both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music .",
  "/wiki/Djembe": "A djembe or jembe ( ; from Malinke jembe ) is a rope-tuned skin-covered goblet drum played with bare hands , originally from West Africa . According to the Bambara people in Mali , the name of the djembe comes from the saying Anke dj\u00e9 , anke b\u00e9 which translates to everyone gather together in peace and defines the drum 's purpose . In the Bambara language , dj\u00e9 is the verb for gather and b\u00e9 translates as peace . The djembe has a body ( or shell ) carved of hardwood and a drumhead made of untreated ( not limed ) rawhide , most commonly made from goatskin . Excluding rings , djembes have an exterior diameter of 30-38 cm ( 12-15 in ) and a height of 58-63 cm ( 23-25 in ) . The majority have a diameter in the 13 to 14 inch range . The weight of a djembe ranges from 5 kg to 13 kg ( 11-29 lb ) and depends on size and shell material . A medium-size djembe carved from one of the traditional woods ( including skin , rings , and rope ) weighs around 9 kg ( 20 lb ) . The djembe can produce a wide variety of sounds , making it a most versatile drum . The drum is very loud , allowing it to be heard clearly as a solo instrument over a large percussion ensemble . The Malink\u00e9 people say that a skilled drummer is one who can make the djembe talk , meaning that the player can tell an emotional story . ( The Malink\u00e9 never used the djembe as a signaling drum . )",

  "/wiki/Saxophone": "The saxophone ( referred to colloquially as the sax ) is a woodwind instrument usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece . Although most saxophones are made from brass , they are categorized as woodwind instruments , because sound is produced by an oscillating reed , traditionally made out of woody cane , rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family . As with the other woodwind instruments , the pitch of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by changing the effective length of the tube . The player covers holes by pressing mechanical keys , triggering a system of pads , pivots , and linkages . The saxophone is used in classical music ( such as concert bands , chamber music , solo repertoire , and , occasionally , orchestras ) , military bands , marching bands , jazz ( such as big bands and jazz combos ) , and contemporary music . The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music . Saxophone players are called saxophonists . Since the first saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s , saxophones have been produced in a variety of series distinguished by transpositions within instrument sets and tuning standard . Sax patented the saxophone on 28 June 1846 , in two groups of seven instruments each . Each series consisted of instruments ranked by pitch , in alternating transposition . The series pitched in B\u266d and E\u266d soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered today are from this series . Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax .",
  "/wiki/Piano": "The piano is an acoustic , stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 ( the exact year is uncertain ) , in which the strings are struck by felt hammers . It is played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings . The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate soft and loud respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume ( i.e. , loudness ) produced in response to a pianist 's touch or pressure on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack . The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord , a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume ; compared to the harpsichord , the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range . An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame . Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( typically padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible , such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then , while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal , shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord .",
  "/wiki/Slide_guitar": "Slide guitar is a particular technique for playing the guitar that is often used in blues-style music . The technique involves placing an object against the strings while playing to create glissando effects and deep vibratos . It typically involves playing the guitar in the traditional position ( flat against the body ) with the use of a tubular slide fitted on one of the guitarist 's fingers . The slide may be a metal or glass tube , such as the neck of a bottle . The term bottleneck was historically used to describe this type of playing . The strings are typically plucked while the slide is moved over the strings to change the pitch . The guitar may also be placed on the player 's lap and played with a hand-held bar and is then referred to as lap slide guitar or lap steel guitar . Creating music with a slide of some type has been traced back to primitive stringed instruments in African culture and also to the origin of the steel guitar in Hawaii . Near the beginning of the twentieth century , blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta popularized the bottleneck slide guitar style , and the first recording of slide guitar was by Sylvester Weaver in 1923 . Since the 1930s , performers including Robert Nighthawk , Earl Hooker , Elmore James and Muddy Waters popularized slide guitar in the electric blues genre and influenced later slide guitarists in the rock genre including the Rolling Stones , Duane Allman and Ry Cooder . Lap slide guitar pioneers include Oscar Buddy Woods , Black Ace Turner and Freddie Roulette .",

  "/wiki/Rhodes_piano": "The Rhodes piano ( also known as the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes ) is an electric piano invented by Harold Rhodes , which became popular in the 1970s . The instrument generates sound like a conventional piano with keys and hammers , but instead of strings , the hammers strike thin metal tines , which vibrate between an electromagnetic pickup . The signal is then sent through a cable to an external keyboard amplifier and speaker . The instrument evolved from Rhodes ' attempt to manufacture pianos while teaching recovering soldiers during World War II . Development continued after the war and into the following decade . Fender started marketing the Piano Bass , a cut-down version of the piano , but the full-size instrument did not appear until after that company 's sale to CBS in 1965 . CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s , and it was used extensively through the decade , particularly in jazz , pop , and soul music . It was less used in the 1980s because of competition with polyphonic and digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 and an inconsistent quality control caused by cost-cutting . The company was eventually sold to Roland , which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization or approval from its inventor . In the 1990s , the instrument experienced a resurgence in popularity , resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights to the piano in 1997 . Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000 , the instrument has since been reissued , and his teaching methods are still in use .",

Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths : from low to high , C2 , G2 , D3 and A3 , an octave lower than the viola . Music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef , with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher-range passages . Played by a cellist or violoncellist , it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment , as well as numerous concerti . The cello often plays the bass part , both in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra 's string section , where the cello may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses . Figured bass music of the Baroque-era typically assumes a cello , viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ , harpsichord , lute or theorbo . Cellos are found in many other ensembles , from modern Chinese orchestras to cello rock bands ."
