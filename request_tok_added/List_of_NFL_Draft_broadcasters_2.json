It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting . The draft was held April 17-18 , 1999 , at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City , New York . The league also held a supplemental draft after the regular draft and before the regular season . Five quarterbacks were selected in the first round - Tim Couch , Donovan McNabb , Akili Smith , Daunte Culpepper , and Cade McNown - the second most ( along with the 2018 NFL Draft ) after the 1983 NFL Draft . Only McNabb and Culpepper , however , would have successful careers , while Couch , Smith , and McNown are generally regarded as draft busts . McNabb , the most successful of the five , was also the only first-round quarterback from the draft to appear in the Super Bowl . The draft is also noted for the Ricky Williams trade , which saw the New Orleans Saints trade all six of their draft picks to the Washington Redskins for the fifth overall selection in order to draft running back Ricky Williams . New Orleans finished with a 3-13 record following the trade and Williams struggled as a rookie , resulting in the firing of Saints head coach Mike Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich .",

Eighth in all-time wins at 205 and fifth in regular season wins at 200 , Schottenheimer has the most wins of a head coach to not reach an NFL championship . After coaching in the NFL , he won a 2011 championship in his one season with the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League ( UFL ) . He was inducted to the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2010 . Schottenheimer 's tenure as an NFL head coach was marked by consistent regular season success and postseason struggles . During the course of over two decades , he went 14 seasons before posting a losing record and had only two seasons with more losses than wins . However , Schottenheimer won only five of 18 postseason games he appeared in and never advanced beyond the conference championship round of the playoffs . Schottenheimer 's Browns were twice denied a Super Bowl berth by the Denver Broncos through game events that later became famous in NFL Lore : John Elway leading the Broncos on a 98-yard , game-tying drive in the 1986 AFC Championship and Earnest Byner fumbling the ball on the Broncos ' goal line with a minute remaining in the 1987 AFC Championship . Both events are now cited as part of the Cleveland sports curse .
