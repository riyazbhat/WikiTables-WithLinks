It was previously based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse using the Short Tucano T.1 , a modified version of the Brazilian Embraer EMB-312 Tucano training aircraft . 72 Squadron started its service life supporting the army during World War I on operations in Middle East and afterwards was quickly disbanded . In its second incarnation the squadron was a real fighter unit , transitioning from Gloster Gladiator biplanes to Gloster Javelin all-weather jets , in between flying the Supermarine Spitfire during the Battle of Britain . The jets went in 1961 and from then till 2002 the squadron flew helicopters in the transport role . The squadron nickname , Basutoland , is derived from the fact that during both world wars , the Basutoland Protectorate , now Lesotho , donated aircraft to RAF , which were assigned to No . 72 Squadron .",
  "/wiki/Westland_Wessex": "The Westland Wessex was a British-built turbine-powered development of the Sikorsky H-34 . It was developed and produced under licence by Westland Aircraft ( later Westland Helicopters ) . One of the main changes from Sikorsky 's H-34 was the replacement of the piston-engine powerplant with a turboshaft engine . Early models were powered by a single Napier Gazelle engine , while later builds used a pair of de Havilland Gnome engines . The Wessex was initially produced for the Royal Navy ( RN ) and later for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) ; a limited number of civilian aircraft were also produced , as well as some export sales . The Wessex operated as an anti-submarine warfare and utility helicopter ; it is perhaps best recognised for its use as a search and rescue ( SAR ) helicopter . The type entered operational service in 1961 , and had a service life in excess of 40 years before being retired in Britain .",

It has an area of 22,970 square kilometres ( 8,867 sq mi ) and a population of 408,487 ( 2019 ) . Its mainland is about 180 mi ( 290 km ) long and 68 mi ( 110 km ) wide . It has the lowest population and population density in Central America . The country 's population growth rate of 1.87% per year ( 2018 estimate ) is the second highest in the region and one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere . The Maya Civilization spread into the area of Belize between 1500 B.C . and A.D. 300 and flourished until about 1200 . European contact began in 1502 when Christopher Columbus sailed along the Gulf of Honduras . European exploration was begun by English settlers in 1638 . This period was also marked by Spain and Britain both laying claim to the land until Britain defeated the Spanish in the Battle of St. George 's Caye ( 1798 ) .

  "/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier": "The Hawker Siddeley Harrier is the first of the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft . It was developed in the 1960s as the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing ( V/STOL ) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era . The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft , following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft , the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 . The British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s . It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A , for use by the US Marine Corps ( USMC ) , in the 1970s . During the Harrier 's service the RAF positioned the bulk of the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces ; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases . The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support , operating from amphibious assault ships , and , if needed , forward operating bases . Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas . The Harrier 's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft . The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process . In the 1970s the British Aerospace Sea Harrier was developed from the Harrier for use by the Royal Navy ( RN ) on s. The Sea Harrier and the Harrier fought in the 1982 Falklands War , in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile . The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force .",

The airliner was designed to operate on long-distance routes from the shorter runways of the era and commanded excellent hot and high performance for operations from African airports . The performance of the VC10 was such that it achieved the fastest crossing of the Atlantic by a jet airliner , a record still held to-date for a sub-sonic airliner , of 5 hours and 1 minute ; only the supersonic Concorde was faster . The VC10 is often compared to the larger Soviet Ilyushin Il-62 , the two types being the only airliners to use a rear-engined quad layout ; the smaller business jet Lockheed JetStar also has this engine arrangement . Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built , they provided long service with BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981 . They were also used from 1965 as strategic air transports for the Royal Air Force , and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft . The 50th anniversary of the first flight of the prototype VC10 , G-ARTA , was celebrated with a VC10 Retrospective Symposium and the official opening of a VC10 exhibition at Brooklands Museum on 29 June 2012 .
