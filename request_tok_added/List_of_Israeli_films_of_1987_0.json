  "/wiki/Hebrew_language": "Hebrew ( /\u02c8hi\u02d0bru\u02d0/ ; \u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea , Ivrit Hebrew pronunciation : [ iv\u02c8\u0281it ] or [ \u0295iv\u02c8\u027eit ] ( listen ) ) is a Northwest Semitic language native to Israel . In 2013 , Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide . Historically , it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors , although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh itself . [ note 1 ] The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE . Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family . Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken , and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language . Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE , declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt . [ note 2 ] Aramaic and , to a lesser extent , Greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-Jewish commerce and poetry . With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language , becoming the main language of the Yishuv , and subsequently of the State of Israel . According to Ethnologue , in 1998 , Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide . After Israel , the United States has the second-largest Hebrew-speaking population , with about 220,000 fluent speakers , mostly from Israel .",

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",
  "/wiki/Romance_film": "Romance films or romance movies are romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theaters and on TV that focus on passion , emotion , and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters and the journey that their love takes them through dating , courtship or marriage . Romance films make the romantic love story or the search for strong and pure love and romance the main plot focus . Occasionally , romance lovers face obstacles such as finances , physical illness , various forms of discrimination , psychological restraints or family that threaten to break their union of love . As in all quite strong , deep , and close romantic relationships , tensions of day-to-day life , temptations ( of infidelity ) , and differences in compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films . Romantic films often explore the essential themes of love at first sight , young with older love , unrequited romantic love , obsessive love , sentimental love , spiritual love , forbidden love/romance , platonic love , sexual and passionate love , sacrificial love , explosive and destructive love , and tragic love . Romantic films serve as great escapes and fantasies for viewers , especially if the two people finally overcome their difficulties , declare their love , and experience life happily ever after , implied by a reunion and final kiss . In romantic television series , the development of such romantic relationships may play out over many episodes , and different characters may become intertwined in different romantic arcs .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Family": "In the context of human society , a family ( from Latin : familia ) is a group of people related either by consanguinity ( by recognized birth ) or affinity ( by marriage or other relationship ) . The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society . Ideally , families would offer predictability , structure , and safety as members mature and participate in the community . In most societies , it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family . Additionally , as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members , it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment , ideally builds a person into a functional adult , transmits culture , and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge . Anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal ( a mother and her children ) ; patrifocal ( a father and his children ) ; conjugal ( a wife , her husband , and children , also called the nuclear family ) ; avuncular ( for example , a grandparent , a brother , his sister , and her children ) ; or extended ( parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent 's family ) . Members of the immediate family may include spouses , parents , grandparents , brothers , sisters , sons , and daughters.Members of the extended family may include aunts , uncles , cousins , nephews , nieces , and siblings-in-law . Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family , depending on an individual 's specific relationship with them , and the legal definition of immediate family varies . Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo . The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history . The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics . The word families can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community , nationhood , global village , and humanism .",
  "/wiki/Fantasy": "Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe , often inspired by real world myth and folklore . Its roots are in oral traditions , which then became fantasy literature and drama . From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media , including film , television , graphic novels , manga and video games . Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively , though these genres overlap . In popular culture , the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature . In its broadest sense , however , fantasy consists of works by many writers , artists , filmmakers , and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works .",
  "/wiki/Musical_film": "Musical film is a film genre with many songs in the movies . The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film 's characters , but in some cases , they serve merely as breaks in the storyline , often as elaborate production numbers . The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology . Typically , the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater . Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater ; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching . In a sense , the viewer becomes the diegetic audience , as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it .",
