  "/wiki/Billboard_200": "The Billboard 200 is a record chart ranking the 200 most popular music albums and EPs in the United States . It is published weekly by Billboard magazine . It is frequently used to convey the popularity of an artist or groups of artists . Often , a recording act will be remembered by its number ones , those of their albums that outperformed all others during at least one week . The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 in May 1967 , and acquired its present title in March 1992 . Its previous names include the Billboard Top LPs ( 1961-72 ) , Billboard Top LPs & Tapes ( 1972-84 ) , Billboard Top 200 Albums ( 1984-85 ) and Billboard Top Pop Albums . The chart is based mostly on sales ( both at retail and digital ) of albums in the United States . The weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991 , but since July 2015 , tracking week begins on Friday ( to coincide with the Global Release Date of the music industry ) and ends on Thursday . A new chart is published the following Tuesday with an issue post-dated to the Saturday of that week , four days later . The chart 's streaming schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday .",
