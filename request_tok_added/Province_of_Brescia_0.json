  "/wiki/Christian_Democracy_(Italy)": "Christian Democracy ( Italian : Democrazia Cristiana , DC ) was a Christian democratic political party in Italy . The DC was founded in 1943 ( in Nazi-occupied Italy ) as the ideal successor of the Italian People 's Party , which had the same symbol , a crossed shield ( scudo crociato ) . A Catholic-inspired , centrist , catch-all party comprising both right- and left-leaning political factions , the DC played a dominant role in the politics of Italy for fifty years , from its inception in 1944 until its final demise in 1994 amid the Tangentopoli scandals . The party was nicknamed the White Whale ( Balena bianca ) , due to party 's huge organization and to its official color . From 1946 until 1994 the DC was the largest party in Parliament , governing in successive coalitions . It originally supported governments based on liberal-conservative political positions , before moving to centre-left coalitions . The party was succeeded by a string of smaller parties , including the Italian People 's Party , the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats , and the still active Union of the Centre . Former Christian Democrats are also spread among other parties , including the centre-right Forza Italia and the centre-left Democratic Party .

  "/wiki/Italian_Socialist_Party": "The Italian Socialist Party ( , PSI ) was a socialist and later social-democratic political party in Italy , whose history stretched for longer than a century , making it one of the longest-living parties of the country . Founded in Genoa in 1892 , the PSI dominated the Italian left until after World War II , when it was eclipsed in status by the Italian Communist Party . The Socialists came to special prominence in the 1980s , when their leader Bettino Craxi , who had severed the residual ties with the Soviet Union and re-branded the party as liberal-socialist , served as Prime Minister ( 1983-1987 ) . The PSI was disbanded in 1994 as a result of the Tangentopoli scandals . The party has had a series of legal successors : the Italian Socialists ( 1994-1998 ) , the Italian Democratic Socialists ( 1998-2007 ) and the Italian Socialist Party ( since 2007 , originally Socialist Party ) . These parties have never reached the popularity of the old PSI . Socialist leading members and voters have joined quite different parties , from the centre-right Forza Italia , The People of Freedom , and the 2013 Forza Italia , to the centre-left Democratic Party . Prior to World War I , future dictator Benito Mussolini was a member of the PSI .",

It was the main member of the Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government , Pole for Freedoms and House of Freedoms coalitions . Throughout its existence , the party was characterised by a strong reliance on the personal image and charisma of its leader - it has therefore been called a personality party or Berlusconi 's personal party - and the skillful use of media campaigns , especially via television . The party 's organisation and ideology depended heavily on its leader . Its appeal to voters was based on Berlusconi 's personality more than on its ideology or programme . In November 2008 the national council of the party , presided by Alfredo Biondi , voted to merge Forza Italia into The People of Freedom ( PdL ) , Berlusconi 's new political vehicle , whose official foundation took place in March 2009 .",
  "/wiki/Lega_Nord": "Lega Nord ( LN ; ) , whose complete name is Lega Nord per l'Indipendenza della Padania ( Northern League for the Independence of Padania ) , is a political party in Italy . In the run-up of the 2018 general election , the party was rebranded as Lega ( League ) without changing its official name in the party 's statute . The party was nonetheless frequently referred to only as Lega even before the rebranding , as well as Carroccio . The LN was established in 1991 as a federation of six regional parties of northern and north-central Italy , including Liga Veneta , Lega Lombarda , Piemont Autonomista , Uniun Ligure , Lega Emiliano-Romagnola and Alleanza Toscana , which became the founding national sections . The party 's founder was Umberto Bossi , federal secretary from 1991 to 2012 . After an internal crisis and struggle , the LN was briefly led by Roberto Maroni , who was elected President of Lombardy in 2013 . Consequently , Matteo Salvini defeated Bossi in a leadership election and became secretary . Currently , Giancarlo Giorgetti and Lorenzo Fontana serve as deputy secretaries , while Roberto Calderoli coordinates the national sections . Leading members include Attilio Fontana ( President of Lombardy ) , Luca Zaia ( President of Veneto ) , Massimiliano Fedriga ( President of Friuli-Venezia Giulia ) , Maurizio Fugatti ( President of Trentino ) and Donatella Tesei ( President of Umbria ) .
