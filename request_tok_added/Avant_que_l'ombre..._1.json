  "/wiki/Virginia_Woolf": "Adeline Virginia Woolf ( /w\u028alf/ ; n\u00e9e Stephen ; 25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941 ) was an English writer , considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and also a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device . Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington , London , the seventh child in a blended family of eight . Her mother , Julia Prinsep Jackson , celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist 's model , had three children from her first marriage , while Woolf 's father , Leslie Stephen , a notable man of letters , had one previous daughter . The Stephens produced another four children , including the modernist painter Vanessa Bell . While the boys in the family received college educations , the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature . An important influence in Virginia Woolf 's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives , Cornwall , where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse , which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse ( 1927 ) . Woolf 's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental breakdown , followed two years later by the death of her half-sister and a mother figure to her , Stella Duckworth . From 1897 to 1901 , she attended the Ladies ' Department of King 's College London , where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women 's higher education and the women 's rights movement . Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her father 's vast library . Encouraged by her father , Woolf began writing professionally in 1900 . Her father 's death in 1905 caused another mental breakdown for Woolf . Following his death , the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury , where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle .",

  "/wiki/Pun": "The pun , also called paronomasia , is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term , or of similar-sounding words , for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect . These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic , homographic , metonymic , or figurative language . A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression , while a pun involves expressions with multiple ( correct or fairly reasonable ) interpretations . Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions , especially as their usage and meaning are usually specific to a particular language or its culture . Puns have a long history in human writing . For example , the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games .",
  "/wiki/Sexual_freedom": "A sexual norm can refer to a personal or a social norm . Most cultures have social norms regarding sexuality , and define normal sexuality to consist only of certain sex acts between individuals who meet specific criteria of age , consanguinity ( e.g . incest ) , race/ethnicity ( e.g . miscegenation ) , and/or social role and socioeconomic status . In most societies , the term 'normal ' identifies a range or spectrum of behaviors . Rather than each act being simply classified as acceptable or not acceptable , many acts are viewed as more or less accepted by different people , and the opinion on how normal or acceptable they are greatly depends on the individual making the opinion as well as the culture itself . Based on information gained from sexological studies , a great many ordinary people 's sex lives are very often quite different from popular beliefs about normal , in private . If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively , they may be called sexual freedom , sexual liberation or free love . If they are regarded negatively , they may be called sexual licence or licentiousness . Restrictive social norms , if judged negatively , are called sexual oppression . If the restrictive norms are judged positively , they may be regarded as encouraging chastity , sexual self-restraint or sexual decency , and negative terms are used for the targeted sexuality , e.g . sexual abuse and perversion .",

  "/wiki/Esoterism": "Western esotericism , also known as esotericism , esoterism , and sometimes the Western mystery tradition , is a term under which scholars have categorised a wide range of loosely related ideas and movements which have developed within Western society . The idea of grouping a wide range of Western traditions and philosophies together under the category that is now termed esotericism developed in Europe during the late seventeenth century . Various academics have debated how to define Western esotericism , with a number of different options proposed . One scholarly model adopts its definition of esotericism from certain esotericist schools of thought themselves , treating esotericism as a perennialist hidden , inner tradition . A second perspective sees esotericism as a category that encompasses movements which embrace an enchanted world-view in the face of increasing disenchantment . A third views Western esotericism as a category encompassing all of Western culture 's rejected knowledge that is accepted neither by the scientific establishment nor by orthodox religious authorities . The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the Eastern Mediterranean during Late Antiquity , where Hermeticism , Gnosticism , and Neoplatonism developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity . Renaissance Europe saw increasing interest in many of these older ideas , with various intellectuals combining pagan philosophies with the Kabbalah and Christian philosophy , resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like Christian theosophy . The seventeenth century saw the development of initiatory societies professing esoteric knowledge such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry , while the Age of Enlightenment of the eighteenth century led to the development of new forms of esoteric thought . The nineteenth century saw the emergence of new trends of esoteric thought that have come to be known as occultism . Prominent groups in this century included the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn . Modern Paganism developed within occultism , and includes religious movements such as Wicca .",

Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily , right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea . The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz . Palermo then became a possession of Carthage . Two Greek colonies were established , known collectively as Panormos or All-Port ; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century BC . As Panormus , the town became part of the Roman Republic and Empire for over a thousand years . From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital . The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm ( Arabic : \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0645 ) , the root for Palermo 's present-day name . Following the Norman reconquest , Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom ( from 1130 to 1816 ) , the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Frederick II and King Conrad IV .

  "/wiki/Ballad": "A ballad is a form of verse , often a narrative set to music . Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson ballad\u00e9e or ballade , which were originally dance songs . Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of Britain and Ireland from the later medieval period until the 19th century . They were widely used across Europe , and later in Australia , North Africa , North America and South America . Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form , consisting of couplets ( two lines ) of rhymed verse , each of 14 syllables . Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated , in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines . Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides . The form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads . In the later 19th century , the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and is often used for any love song , particularly the sentimental ballad of pop or rock music , although the term is also associated with the concept of a stylized storytelling song or poem , particularly when used as a title for other media such as a film .",

  "/wiki/Angel": "An angel is generally a supernatural being found in various religions and mythologies . Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between God ( or Heaven ) and humanity . Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings , and carrying out tasks on behalf of God . Abrahamic religions often organize angels into hierarchies , although such rankings may vary between sects in each religion . Such angels may receive specific names ( such as Gabriel or Michael ) or titles ( such as seraph or archangel ) . People have also extended the use of the term angel to various notions of spirits or figures found in other religious traditions . The theological study of angels is known as angelology . Angels expelled from Heaven are referred to as fallen angels as distinct from the heavenly host . In fine art angels are usually depicted as having the shape of human beings of extraordinary beauty but no gender ( until the 19th century at least ) . They are often identified In Christian artwork with bird wings , halos , and light .",
  "/wiki/Satan": "Satan , also known as the Devil , is an entity in the Abrahamic religions that seduces humans into sin or falsehood . In Christianity and Islam , he is usually seen as either a fallen angel or a jinn , who used to possess great piety and beauty , but rebelled against God , who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and a host of demons . In Judaism , Satan is typically regarded as a metaphor for the yetzer hara , or evil inclination , or as an agent subservient to God . A figure known as the satan first appears in the Tanakh as a heavenly prosecutor , a member of the sons of God subordinate to Yahweh , who prosecutes the nation of Judah in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh 's followers by forcing them to suffer . During the intertestamental period , possibly due to influence from the Zoroastrian figure of Angra Mainyu , the satan developed into a malevolent entity with abhorrent qualities in dualistic opposition to God . In the apocryphal Book of Jubilees , Yahweh grants the satan ( referred to as Mastema ) authority over a group of fallen angels , or their offspring , to tempt humans to sin and punish them . In the Synoptic Gospels , Satan tempts Jesus in the desert and is identified as the cause of illness and temptation . In the Book of Revelation , Satan appears as a Great Red Dragon , who is defeated by Michael the Archangel and cast down from Heaven . He is later bound for one thousand years , but is briefly set free before being ultimately defeated and cast into the Lake of Fire . In Christianity , Satan is also known as the Devil and , although the Book of Genesis does not mention him , he is often identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden . In the Middle Ages , Satan played a minimal role in Christian theology and was used as a comic relief figure in mystery plays . During the early modern period , Satan 's significance greatly increased as beliefs such as demonic possession and witchcraft became more prevalent .",
