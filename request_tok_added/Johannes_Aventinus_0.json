  "/wiki/Tuisto": "According to Tacitus 's Germania ( AD 98 ) , Tuisto ( or Tuisco ) is the legendary divine ancestor of the Germanic peoples . The figure remains the subject of some scholarly discussion , largely focused upon etymological connections and comparisons to figures in later ( particularly Norse ) Germanic mythology .",
  "/wiki/Mannus": "Mannus , according to the Roman writer Tacitus , was a figure in the creation myths of the Germanic tribes . Tacitus is the only source of these myths . Tacitus wrote that Mannus was the son of Tuisto and the progenitor of the three Germanic tribes Ingaevones , Herminones and Istvaeones . In discussing the German tribes Tacitus wrote : Several authors consider the name Mannus in Tacitus ' work to stem from an Indo-European root ; see Proto-Indo-European religion , Brothers . The names Mannus and Tuisto/Tuisco seem to have some relation to Proto-Germanic Mannaz , man and Tiwaz , Tyr , the god . Mannus again became popular in literature in the 16th century , after works published by Annius de Viterbo and Johannes Aventinus purported to list him as a primeval king over Germany and Sarmatia . In the 19th century , F. Nork wrote that the names of the three sons of Mannus can be extrapolated as Ingui , Irmin , and Istaev or Iscio . A few scholars like Ralph T. H. Griffith have expressed a connection between Mannus and the names of other ancient founder-kings , such as Minos of Greek mythology , and Manu of Hindu tradition . Guido von List incorporated the myth of Mannus and his sons into his occult beliefs which were later adopted into Nazi occult beliefs .",
  "/wiki/Laertes": "In Greek mythology , Laertes ( ; , La\u00e9rt\u0113s ; also spelled La\u00ebrtes ) was an Argonaut and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar . His title was King of the Cephallenians , an ethnic group who lived both on the Ionian islands and on the mainland , which he presumably inherited from his father Arcesius and grandfather Cephalus . His realm included Ithaca and surrounding islands , and perhaps even the neighboring part of the mainland of other Greek city-states .",
  "/wiki/Ingaevones": "The Ingaevones were a West Germanic cultural group living along the North Sea coast in the areas of Jutland , Holstein , and Frisia in the classical period . Tribes in this area included the Frisii , Chauci , ( later replaced by the Saxons ) and Jutes . The name is sometimes given by modern editors or translators as Ingvaeones , on the assumption that this is more likely to be the correct form , since an etymology can be formed for it as 'son of Yngvi ' , Yngvi occurring later as a Scandinavian divine name . Hence the postulated common group of closely related dialects of the Ingvaeones is called Ingvaeonic or North Sea Germanic . Tacitus ' source categorized the Ingaevones near the ocean as one of the three tribal groups descended from the three sons of Mannus , son of Tuisto , progenitor of all the Germanic peoples , the other two being the Irminones and the Istaevones . According to the speculations of , this threefold subdivision of the West Germanic tribes corresponds to archeological evidence from Late Antiquity . Pliny ca 80 CE in his Natural History ( IV.28 ) lists the Ingaevones as one of the five Germanic races , the others being the Vandili , the Istvaeones , the Hermiones and the Bastarnae . According to him , the Ingaevones were made up of Cimbri , Teutons and Chauci . Stripped of its Latin ending , the Ingvaeon are the Ingwine , friends of Ing familiar from Beowulf , where Hrothgar is Lord of the Ingwine - whether one of them or lord over them being ambiguous . An Ingui is also listed in the Anglo-Saxon royal house of Bernicia and was probably once seen as the progenitor of all Anglian kings . Since the Ingaevones form the bulk of the Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain , they were speculated by Noah Webster to have given England its name , and Grigsby remarks that on the continent they formed part of the confederacy known as the 'friends of Ing ' and in the new lands they migrated to in the 5th and 6th centuries . In time , they would name these lands Angle-land , and it is tempting to speculate that the word Angle was derived from , or thought of as a pun on , the name of Ing .",
  "/wiki/Odysseus": "Odysseus ( /o\u028a\u02c8d\u026asi\u0259s , o\u028a\u02c8d\u026asju\u02d0s/ ; Greek : \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 , \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 , \u1f48dysse\u00fas [ odysse\u035c\u00fas ] ) , also known by the Latin variant Ulysses , is a legendary Greek king of Ithaca and the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey . Odysseus also plays a key role in Homer 's Iliad and other works in that same epic cycle . Son of La\u00ebrtes and Anticlea , husband of Penelope , and father of Telemachus and Acusilaus . Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual brilliance , guile , and versatility ( polytropos ) , and is thus known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning ( Greek : \u03bc\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 or m\u0113tis , cunning intelligence ) . He is most famous for his nostos , or homecoming , which took him ten eventful years after the decade-long Trojan War .",
  "/wiki/Istvaeones": "The Istvaeones ( also spelled Ist\u00e6vones ) were a Germanic group of tribes living near the banks of the Rhine during the Roman empire which reportedly shared a common culture and origin . The Istaevones were contrasted to neighbouring groups , the Ingaevones on the North Sea coast , and the Herminones , living inland of these groups . In linguistics , the term Istvaeonic languages is also sometimes used in discussions about the grouping of the northwestern West Germanic languages , consisting of Frankish and its descendants ( principally Old Dutch ) as well as several closely related historical dialects . Whether or not the Istvaeones spoke a Germanic language according to modern definitions , the theory proposes that their language indirectly influenced later Germanic languages in the area as a substrate .",
  "/wiki/Brennus_(4th_century_BC)": "Brennus ( or Brennos ) was a chieftain of the Senones . He defeated the Romans at the Battle of the Allia ( 18 July 390 BC ) . In 387 BC he led an army of Cisalpine Gauls in their attack on Rome and captured most of the city , holding it for several months . Brennus 's sack of Rome was the only time in 800 years the city was occupied by a non-Roman army before the fall of the city to the Visigoths in 410 AD .",
  "/wiki/Irminones": "The Irminones , also referred to as Herminones or Hermiones ( ) , were a large group of early Germanic tribes settling in the Elbe watershed and by the 1st century AD expanding into Bavaria , Swabia and Bohemia . Notably this included the large sub-group of the Suevi , that itself contained many different tribal groups , but the Irminones also for example included the Chatti . Irminonic or Elbe Germanic is also therefore a term for one of the unattested dialect groups ancestral to the West Germanic language family , especially the High German languages , which include modern Standard German .",
  "/wiki/Hector": "In Greek mythology and Roman mythology , Hector ( ; , ) was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War . He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defence of Troy , killing 31,000 Greek fighters . He was ultimately killed by Achilles .",
  "/wiki/Brennus_(3rd_century_BC)": "Brennus ( or Brennos ) ( died 279 BC at Delphi , Ancient Greece ) was one of the Gaul leaders of the army of the Gallic invasion of the Balkans . While invading the Greek mainland he managed to momentarily reach as far south as Delphi in an attempt to loot the rich treasury of the sanctuary of Apollo . His army suffered a devastating defeat at Delphi , he was heavily injured during the battle and committed suicide there . His militarily inexperienced army was forced to a continuous retreat by the tactical attacks of the Greek city-states and was cut down to a remaining band that fled from Greece . In 280 BC a great army , comprising about 85,000 warriors , coming from Pannonia and split in three divisions , marched south in a great expedition to the Greek mainland against Macedonia and then further south to central Greece as far south as Delphi during a failed and short-lived campaign against the Greek city-states . The division led by Brennus and Acichorius moved against the Paionians . Some writers suppose that Brennus and Acichorius are the same person , the former being only a title and the latter the real name . The other two divisions were led by Cerethrius and Bolgios , moving against the Thracians and Triballi , and against the Macedonians and Illyrians , respectively . Brennus is said to have belonged to an otherwise unknown tribe called the Prausi . These Gauls had settled in Pannonia because of population increases in Gaul , and sought further conquests .",
  "/wiki/Boiorix": "Boiorix was a king of the Cimbri tribe during the Cimbrian War . His most notable achievement was the victory against the Romans at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC .

  "/wiki/Ariovistus": "Ariovistus was a leader of the Suebi and other allied Germanic peoples in the second quarter of the 1st century BC . He and his followers took part in a war in Gaul , assisting the Arverni and Sequani in defeating their rivals , the Aedui .
