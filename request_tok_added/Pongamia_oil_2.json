  "/wiki/Acid_value": "Acid value ( or neutralization number or acid number or acidity ) is the mass of potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) in milligrams that is required to neutralize one gram of chemical substance . The acid number is a measure of the number of carboxylic acid groups in a chemical compound , such as a fatty acid , or in a mixture of compounds . In a typical procedure , a known amount of sample dissolved in an organic solvent ( often isopropanol ) and titrated with a solution of potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) of known concentration using phenolphthalein as a colour indicator . The acid number is used to quantify the acidity of a substance e.g . biodiesel . It is the quantity of base , expressed in milligrams of potassium hydroxide , that is required to neutralize the acidic constituents in 1 g of sample . V is the volume of titrant ( ml ) consumed by the crude oil sample and 1 ml of spiking solution at the equivalent point , b is the volume of titrant ( ml ) consumed by 1 ml of spiking solution at the equivalent point , and 56.1 g/mol is the molecular weight of KOH . W is the mass of the sample in grams . The molar concentration of titrant ( N ) is calculated as such : In which W is the mass ( g ) of KHP in 50 ml of KHP standard solution , V is the volume of titrant ( ml ) consumed by 50 ml KHP standard solution at the equivalent point , and 204.23 g/mol is the molecular weight of KHP . There are standard methods for determining the acid number , such as ASTM D 974 and DIN 51558 ( for mineral oils , biodiesel ) , or specifically for biodiesel using the European Standard EN 14104 and ASTM D664 are both widely used worldwide . Acid number ( mg KOH/g oil ) for biodiesel should to be lower than 0.50 mg KOH/g in both EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standard fuels . This is since the FFA produced may corrode automotive parts and these limits protect vehicle engines and fuel tanks .",
  "/wiki/Calorific_value": "The heating value ( or energy value or calorific value ) of a substance , usually a fuel or food ( see food energy ) , is the amount of heat released during the combustion of a specified amount of it . The calorific value is the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions . The chemical reaction is typically a hydrocarbon or other organic molecule reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water and release heat . It may be expressed with the quantities : There are two kinds of heat of combustion , called higher and lower heating value , depending on how much the products are allowed to cool and whether compounds like are allowed to condense . The values are conventionally measured with a bomb calorimeter . They may also be calculated as the difference between the heat of formation \u0394H of the products and reactants ( though this approach is somewhat artificial since most heats of formation are calculated from measured heats of combustion ) . For a fuel of composition CHON , the ( higher ) heat of combustion is usually to a good approximation ( \u00b13% ) , though it can be drastically wrong if ( for instance in the case of nitroglycerine ( ) this formula would predict a heat of combustion of 0 ) . The value corresponds to an exothermic reaction ( a negative change in enthalpy ) because the double bond in molecular oxygen is much weaker than other double bonds or pairs of single bonds , particularly those in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water ; conversion of the weak bonds in oxygen to the stronger bonds in carbon dioxide and water releases energy as heat . By convention , the heat of combustion is defined to be the heat released for the complete combustion of a compound in its standard state to form stable products in their standard states : hydrogen is converted to water ( in its liquid state ) , carbon is converted to carbon dioxide gas , and nitrogen is converted to nitrogen gas . That is , the heat of combustion , \u0394H\u00b0 , is the heat of reaction of the following process : Chlorine and sulfur are not quite standardized ; they are usually assumed to convert to hydrogen chloride gas and SO or SO gas , respectively , or to dilute aqueous hydrochloric and sulfuric acids , respectively , when the combustion is conducted in a bomb containing some quantity of water .",
  "/wiki/Cetane_number": "Cetane number ( cetane rating ) is an indicator of the combustion speed of diesel fuel and compression needed for ignition . It plays a similar role for diesel as octane rating does for gasoline . The CN is an important factor in determining the quality of diesel fuel , but not the only one ; other measurements of diesel fuel 's quality include ( but are not limited to ) energy content , density , lubricity , cold-flow properties and sulphur content .",
  "/wiki/Density": "The density ( more precisely , the volumetric mass density ; also known as specific mass ) , of a substance is its mass per unit volume . The symbol most often used for density is \u03c1 ( the lower case Greek letter rho ) , although the Latin letter D can also be used . Mathematically , density is defined as mass divided by volume :",
  "/wiki/Iodine_value": "The iodine value ( or iodine adsorption value or iodine number or iodine index ) in chemistry is the mass of iodine in grams that is consumed by 100 grams of a chemical substance . Iodine numbers are often used to determine the amount of unsaturation in fatty acids . This unsaturation is in the form of double bonds , which react with iodine compounds . The higher the iodine number , the more C=C bonds are present in the fat . It can be seen from the table that coconut oil is very saturated , which means it is good for making soap . On the other hand , linseed oil is highly unsaturated , which makes it a drying oil , well suited for making oil paints .",
  "/wiki/Saponification_value": "Saponification value number represents the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to saponify 1g of fat under the conditions specified . It is a measure of the average molecular weight ( or chain length ) of all the fatty acids present . As most of the mass of a fat/tri-ester is in the 3 fatty acids , the saponification value allows for comparison of the average fatty acid chain length . The long chain fatty acids found in fats have a low saponification value because they have a relatively fewer number of carboxylic functional groups per unit mass of the fat as compared to short chain fatty acids . If more moles of base are required to saponify N grams of fat then there are more moles of the fat and the chain lengths are relatively small , given the following relation : Number of moles = mass of oil / average molecular mass The calculated molar mass is not applicable to fats and oils containing high amounts of unsaponifiable material , free fatty acids ( > 0.1% ) , or mono- and diacylglycerols ( > 0.1% ) . Handmade soap makers who aim for bar soap use NaOH ( sodium hydroxide , lye ) . Because saponification values are listed in KOH ( potassium hydroxide ) the value must be converted from potassium to sodium to make bar soap ; potassium soaps make a paste , gel or liquid soap . To convert KOH values to NaOH values , divide the KOH values by the ratio of the molecular weights of KOH and NaOH ( 1.403 ) . Standard methods for analysis are for example : ASTM D5558 for vegetable and animal fats , ASTM D 94 ( for petroleum ) and DIN 51559 .",
  "/wiki/Specific_gravity": "Specific gravity , also called relative density , is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance ; equivalently , it is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume . Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance . The reference substance for liquids is nearly always water at its densest ( at ) ; for gases it is air at room temperature ( ) . Nonetheless , the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference . Pressure is nearly always . Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry . In British beer brewing , the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1,000 . Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines , hydrocarbons , antifreeze coolants , sugar solutions ( syrups , juices , honeys , brewers wort , must , etc . ) and acids .",

  "/wiki/Viscosity": "The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate . For liquids , it corresponds to the informal concept of thickness : for example , syrup has a higher viscosity than water . Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion . For instance , when a fluid is forced through a tube , it flows more quickly near the tube 's axis than near its walls . In such a case , experiments show that some stress ( such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube ) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube . This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion : the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity . A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid . Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids . Otherwise , the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity ; such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid . A fluid with a high viscosity , such as pitch , may appear to be a solid .",
  "/wiki/Boiling_point": "The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor . The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure . A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure . A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure . For example , water boils at at sea level , but at at altitude . For a given pressure , different liquids will boil at different temperatures . The normal boiling point ( also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point ) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level , one atmosphere . At that temperature , the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid . The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar . The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity ( a mol , kg , pound , etc . ) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure ( often atmospheric pressure ) . Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation .",
  "/wiki/Cloud_point": "In the petroleum industry , cloud point refers to the temperature below which wax in diesel or biowax in biodiesels forms a cloudy appearance . The presence of solidified waxes thickens the oil and clogs fuel filters and injectors in engines . The wax also accumulates on cold surfaces ( producing , for example , pipeline or heat exchanger fouling ) and forms an emulsion with water . Therefore , cloud point indicates the tendency of the oil to plug filters or small orifices at cold operating temperatures . An everyday example of cloud point can be seen in olive oil stored in cold weather . Olive oil begins to solidify at around 4 \u00b0C , whereas winter temperatures in temperate countries can often be colder than 0 \u00b0C . In these conditions , olive oil begins to develop white , waxy clumps of solidified oil that sink to the bottom of the container . In crude or heavy oils , cloud point is synonymous with wax appearance temperature ( WAT ) and wax precipitation temperature ( WPT ) . The cloud point of a nonionic surfactant or glycol solution is the temperature at which the mixture starts to phase-separate , and two phases appear , thus becoming cloudy . This behavior is characteristic of non-ionic surfactants containing polyoxyethylene chains , which exhibit reverse solubility versus temperature behavior in water and therefore cloud out at some point as the temperature is raised . Glycols demonstrating this behavior are known as cloud-point glycols and are used as shale inhibitors.The cloud point is affected by salinity , being generally lower in more saline fluids .",
  "/wiki/Fire_Point": "The fire point of a fuel is the lowest temperature at which the vapour of that fuel will continue to burn for at least 6 seconds after ignition by an open flame of standard dimension . At the flash point , a lower temperature , a substance will ignite briefly , but vapor might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire . Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points . Although in general the fire points can be assumed to be about 10 \u00b0C higher than the flash points , although this is no substitute for testing if the fire point is safety critical . Testing of the fire point is done by open cup apparatus .",
  "/wiki/Flash_point": "The flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature at which vapours of the material will ignite , when given an ignition source . The flash point is sometimes confused with the autoignition temperature , the temperature that results in spontaneous autoignition . The fire point is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after the ignition source is removed . The fire point is higher than the flash point , because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion . Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature , but ignition source temperature is far higher than either the flash or fire point .",
  "/wiki/Pour_point": "The pour point of a liquid is the temperature below which the liquid loses its flow characteristics . It is defined as the minimum temperature in which the oil has the ability to pour down from a beaker . In crude oil a high pour point is generally associated with a high paraffin content , typically found in crude deriving from a larger proportion of plant material . That type of crude oil is mainly derived from a kerogen Type III ."
