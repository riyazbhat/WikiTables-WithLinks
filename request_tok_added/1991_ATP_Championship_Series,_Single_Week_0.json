In 1989 it was upgraded to become one of the premier nine tournaments of the Grand Prix Tour ( Grand Prix Super Series ) , replacing the Tokyo Open . The event is usually the final tournament on the tour before the season-ending ATP Finals . Because of its sponsorship , the event was officially known from 2003 to 2016 as BNP Paribas Masters , and from 2017 as the Rolex Paris Masters . Prior to the Tennis Masters Series replacing the ATP Super 9 in 2000 , the event was known as the Paris Open . It is also often referred to as the Paris Indoor event in reference to both the facts that the other tennis event held in Paris , the French Open is held outdoors , and that since 2009 , it is the only Masters 1000 tournament which is played indoors .
