  "/wiki/Tignes": "Tignes ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ ti\u0272 ] ) is a commune in the Tarentaise Valley , in the Savoie department in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France , known for the highest skiable area in Europe and the longest ski season in Europe . It is located in the Savoie region with good transport links in and out of Lyon , Geneva and Chambery . It is best known as a snow sure ski resort . Together with neighbouring Val d'Is\u00e8re , it forms the Espace Killy ski area . The proximity of two resorts offers one of the most seamless links between ski areas in Europe , in effect creating a single skiable area of over 300 km piste . Whilst not the largest ski area in the Alps , the level of integration between the two resorts has the effect of making it feel as one , often described as feeling like one of the largest single ski areas as a result . Tignes was the freestyle skiing venue for the 1992 Winter Olympics , co-host city for the 1992 Winter Paralympics and host of the Winter X Games . This , coupled with the year round skiing , season length and large number of ski parks/slalom runs has supplanted Tignes as the go to training ground for snow sport athletes . The terrain of valley lends itself to more challenging skiing , with advanced skiers often opting for the resort as their preferred ski area . The town has however strived to improve its appeal to beginner and intermediate skiers with the introduction of easier runs lower down in the valley towards Tignes-Les-Br\u00e9vi\u00e8res and upgrading/installing new chairlifts with smaller elevation gains .",
