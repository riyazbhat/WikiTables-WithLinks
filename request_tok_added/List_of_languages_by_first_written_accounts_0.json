  "/wiki/Egyptian_language": "The Egyptian language ( Egyptian : r n km.t , ) was spoken in ancient Egypt and was a branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages . Its attestation stretches over an extraordinarily long time , from the Old Egyptian stage ( mid-4th millennium BC , Old Kingdom of Egypt ) . Its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC , which makes it one of the oldest recorded languages known , along with Sumerian . Its classical form is known as Middle Egyptian , the vernacular of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt which remained the literary language of Egypt until the Roman period . The spoken language had evolved into Demotic by the time of Classical Antiquity , and finally into Coptic by the time of Christianisation . Spoken Coptic was almost extinct by the 17th century , but it remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria .",
  "/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs": "Egyptian hieroglyphs ( ) were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt . Hieroglyphs combined logographic , syllabic and alphabetic elements , with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters . Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood . The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing , as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet . Through the Phoenician alphabet 's major child systems , the Greek and Aramaic scripts , the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use , most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts ( through Greek ) and the Arabic script and Brahmic family of scripts ( through Aramaic ) . The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age , around the 32nd century BC ( Naqada III ) , with the first decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty ( 28th century BC ) . Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom period ; during this period , the system made use of about 900 distinct signs . The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom and Late Period , and on into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods . Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Roman period , extending into the 4th century AD . With the final closing of pagan temples in the 5th century , knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost . Although attempts were made , the script remained undeciphered throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period . The decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was finally accomplished in the 1820s by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion , with the help of the Rosetta Stone .",
  "/wiki/Seth-Peribsen": "Seth-Peribsen ( also known as Ash-Peribsen , Peribsen and Perabsen ) is the serekh name of an early Egyptian monarch ( pharaoh ) , who ruled during the Second Dynasty of Egypt ( c. 2890 - c. 2686 BC ) . His chronological position within this dynasty is unknown and it is disputed who ruled both before and after him . The duration of his reign is also unknown . Peribsen 's name is unusual , in that Set , not Horus , was his patron deity . This goes against the Egyptian tradition of a king choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron . Peribsen 's tomb was discovered in 1898 at Abydos . It was well preserved and showed traces of restoration undertaken during later dynastic periods .",

Its modern name means Mother of Pots as the whole area is littered with the broken pot shards of offerings made in earlier times . The cultic ancient name of the area was ( w- ) pkr or ( r\ua723- ) pkr District of the pkr [ -tree ] ( an unidentified species ) or Opening of the pkr [ -tree ] ( Coptic : upoke ) , belonging to t\ua723-dsr the secluded/cleared land ( necropolis ) or crk-hh Binding of Eternity ( Coptic : Alkhah ) . The area was a site of veneration and worship in ancient Egypt , and by the time of the Middle Kingdom , at least one of the royal tombs was excavated and rebuilt for the priests of Osiris . The tombs of this area were first excavated by \u00c9mile Am\u00e9lineau in the 1890s and more systematically by Flinders Petrie between 1899-1901 . Since then the area has been excavated repeatedly by the German Archaeological Institute since the 1970s , which has allowed for a thorough reconstruction of the original layout and appearance of these tombs .",
  "/wiki/Naqada_III": "Naqada III is the last phase of the Naqada culture of ancient Egyptian prehistory , dating approximately from 3200 to 3000 BC . It is the period during which the process of state formation , which had begun to take place in Naqada II , became highly visible , with named kings heading powerful polities . Naqada III is often referred to as Dynasty 0 or the Protodynastic Period to reflect the presence of kings at the head of influential states , although , in fact , the kings involved would not have been a part of a dynasty . They would more probably have been completely unrelated and very possibly in competition with each other . In this period , those kings ' names were inscribed in the form of serekhs on a variety of surfaces including pottery and tombs .",
  "/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt": "Abydos ( ; Sahidic ' ) is one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt , and also of the eighth nome in Upper Egypt . It is located about west of the Nile at latitude 26\u00b0 10 ' N , near the modern Egyptian towns of el-'Araba el Madfuna and al-Balyana . In the ancient Egyptian language , the city was called Abdju ' ( \ua723b\u1e0fw or AbDw ) . The English name Abydos comes from the Greek , a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of Abydos on the Hellespont . Considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt , the sacred city of Abydos was the site of many ancient temples , including Umm el-Qa'ab , a royal necropolis where early pharaohs were entombed . These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area , leading to the growth of the town 's importance as a cult site . Today , Abydos is notable for the memorial temple of Seti I , which contains an inscription from the nineteenth dynasty known to the modern world as the Abydos King List . It is a chronological list showing cartouches of most dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from Menes until Seti I 's father , Ramesses I . The Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple . Many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost ; many may have been destroyed by the new construction .",
  "/wiki/Narmer_Palette": "The Narmer Palette , also known as the Great Hierakonpolis Palette or the Palette of Narmer , is a significant Egyptian archeological find , dating from about the 31st century BC , belonging , at least nominally , to the category of Cosmetic palettes . It contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found . The tablet is thought by some to depict the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the king Narmer . On one side , the king is depicted with the bulbed White Crown of Upper ( southern ) Egypt , and the other side depicts the king wearing the level Red Crown of Lower ( northern ) Egypt . Along with the Scorpion Macehead and the Narmer Maceheads , also found together in the Main Deposit at Nekhen , the Narmer Palette provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king . The Palette shows many of the classic conventions of Ancient Egyptian art , which must already have been formalized by the time of the Palette 's creation . The Egyptologist Bob Brier has referred to the Narmer Palette as the first historical document in the world . The Palette , which has survived five millennia in almost perfect condition , was discovered by British archeologists James E. Quibell and Frederick W. Green , in what they called the Main Deposit in the Temple of Horus at Nekhen , during the dig season of 1897-98 . Also found at this dig were the Narmer Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead . The exact place and circumstances of these finds were not recorded very clearly by Quibell and Green . In fact , Green 's report placed the Palette in a different layer one or two yards away from the deposit , which is considered to be more accurate on the basis of the original excavation notes . It has been suggested that these objects were royal donations made to the temple .",
  "/wiki/Sumerian_language": "Sumerian ( \ud808\udd74\ud808\udca0 EME.G\u0303IR15 native tongue ) is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate that was spoken in Mesopotamia ( modern-day Iraq ) and in Syria . During the 3rd millennium BC , an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Semitic-speaking Akkadians , which included widespread bilingualism . The influence of Sumerian and the East Semitic language Akkadian on each other is evident in all areas , from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale , to syntactic , morphological , and phonological convergence . This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a Sprachbund . Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language around 2000 BC ( the exact dating being subject to debate ) , but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred , ceremonial , literary and scientific language in Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian states such as Assyria and Babylonia until the 1st century AD . Thereafter it was likely forgotten until the 19th century , when Assyriologists began deciphering the cuneiform inscriptions and excavated tablets left by these speakers .",
  "/wiki/Instructions_of_Shuruppak": "The Instructions of Shuruppak ( or , Instructions of \u0160uruppak son of Ubara-tutu ) are a significant example of Sumerian wisdom literature . Wisdom literature , intended to teach proper piety , inculcate virtue , and preserve community standards , was common throughout the ancient Near East . The text is set in great antiquity by its incipit : In those days , in those far remote times , in those nights , in those faraway nights , in those years , in those far remote years . The precepts are placed in the mouth of a king \u0160uruppak ( SU.KUR.RU ) , son of Ubara-Tutu . Ubara-Tutu is recorded in most extant copies of the Sumerian king list as being the final king of Sumer prior to the deluge . Ubara-tutu is briefly mentioned in tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh . He is identified as the father of Utnapishtim , a character who is instructed by the god Ea to build a boat in order to survive the coming flood . Grouped with the other cuneiform tablets from Abu Salabikh , the Instructions date to the early third millennium BCE , being among the oldest surviving literature . The text consists of admonitory sayings of \u0160uruppak addressed to his son and eventual flood hero Ziusudra ( Akkadian : Utnapishtin ) . Otherwise named as one of the five antediluvian cities in the Sumerian tradition , the name \u0160uruppak appears in one manuscript of the Sumerian King List ( WB-62 , written SU.KUR.LAM ) where it is interpolated as an additional generation between Ubara-Tutu and Ziusudra , who are in every other instance father and son . Lambert reports that it has been suggested the interpolation may have arisen through an epithet of the father ( man of Shuruppak ) having been taken wrongly for a proper name . However , this epithet , found in the Gilgamesh XI tablet , is a designation applied to Utnapishtim , not his father .",

  "/wiki/Cuneiform": "Cuneiform , or Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform , was one of the earliest systems of writing , invented by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia . It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets , made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus . The name cuneiform itself simply means wedge-shaped . Emerging in Sumer in the late fourth millennium BC ( the Uruk IV period ) to convey the Sumerian language , which was a language isolate , cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms , stemming from an earlier system of shaped tokens used for accounting . In the third millennium , the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller ( Hittite cuneiform ) . The system consists of a combination of logophonetic , consonantal alphabetic , and syllabic signs . The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Semitic Akkadian ( Assyrian/Babylonian ) , Eblaite and Amorite languages , the language isolates Elamite , Hattic , Hurrian and Urartian , as well as Indo-European languages Hittite and Luwian ; it inspired the later Semitic Ugaritic alphabet as well as Old Persian cuneiform . Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-612 BC ) . By the second century AD , the script had become extinct , its last traces being found in Assyria and Babylonia , and all knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century . Geoffrey Sampson stated that Egyptian hieroglyphs came into existence a little after Sumerian script , and , probably , [ were ] invented under the influence of the latter , and that it is probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to Egypt from Sumerian Mesopotamia . There are many instances of Egypt-Mesopotamia relations at the time of the invention of writing , and standard reconstructions of the development of writing generally place the development of the Sumerian proto-cuneiform script before the development of Egyptian hieroglyphs , with the suggestion the former influenced the latter . Between half a million and two million cuneiform tablets are estimated to have been excavated in modern times , of which only approximately 30,000-100,000 have been read or published .",

  "/wiki/Fara_period": "The Early Dynastic period ( abbreviated ED period or ED ) is an archaeological culture in Mesopotamia ( modern-day Iraq ) that is generally dated to c. 2900-2350 BC and was preceded by the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods . It is part of the history of Mesopotamia . It saw the development of writing and the formation of the first cities and states . The ED itself was characterized by the existence of multiple city-states : small states with a relatively simple structure that developed and solidified over time . This development ultimately led to the unification of much of Mesopotamia under the rule of Sargon , the first monarch of the Akkadian Empire . Despite this political fragmentation , the ED city-states shared a relatively homogeneous material culture . Sumerian cities such as Uruk , Ur , Lagash , Umma , and Nippur located in Lower Mesopotamia were very powerful and influential . To the north and west stretched states centered on cities such as Kish , Mari , Nagar , and Ebla . The study of Central and Lower Mesopotamia has long been given priority over neighboring regions . Archaeological sites in Central and Lower Mesopotamia - notably Girsu but also Eshnunna , Khafajah , Ur , and many others - have been excavated since the 1800s . These excavations have yielded cuneiform texts and many other important artifacts . As a result , this area was better known than neighboring regions , but the excavation and publication of the archives of Ebla have changed this perspective by shedding more light on surrounding areas , such as Upper Mesopotamia , western Syria , and southwestern Iran .",

A plaster-cast of the artifact is today in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum . The Kish tablet is inscribed with proto-cuneiform signs . It has been dated to ca . 3500 BC ( middle Uruk period ) , although some scholars believe it may be from somewhat later - Uruk IV period ( ca . 3350-3200 BC ) . Several thousands of proto-cuneiform documents dating to Uruk IV and III periods ( ca . 3350-3000 BC ) have been found in Uruk . The writing is still purely pictographic , and represents a transitional stage between proto-writing and the emergence of the partly syllabic writing of the cuneiform script proper . The proto-literate period of Egypt and Mesopotamia is taken to span about 3500 to 2900 BC . The administrative texts of the Jemdet Nasr period ( 3100-2900 BC ) , found among other places at Jemdet Nasr and Tell Uqair represent a further stage in the development from proto-cuneiform to cuneiform , but can still not be identified with certainty as being written in Sumerian , although it is likely .",
  "/wiki/Uruk": "Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer ( and later of Babylonia ) , situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates river , on the dried-up , ancient channel of the Euphrates , some 30 km ( 19 mi ) east of modern Samawah , Al-Muthann\u0101 , Iraq . Uruk is the type site for the Uruk period . Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC . At its height c. 2900 BC , Uruk probably had 50,000-80,000 residents living in 6 km2 ( 2.32 sq mi ) of walled area ; making it the largest city in the world at the time . The legendary king Gilgamesh , according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian king list , ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC . The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC , in the context of the struggle of Babylonia against Elam , but it remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid ( 312-63 BC ) and Parthian ( 227 BC to 224 AD ) periods until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633-638 . William Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849 and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854 ; he had identified it as Erech , known as the second city of Nimrod . The Arabic name of Babylonia , which eventually became the name of the present-day country , al-\u02bfIr\u0101q , is thought to derive from the name Uruk , via Aramaic ( Erech ) and possibly via Middle Persian ( Er\u0101q ) transmission .

Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf , the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland , on the south bank of the Euphrates , 16 kilometres ( 9.9 miles ) from Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq . The city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800 BC , and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC , its first recorded king being Mesannepada .

  "/wiki/Canaanite_languages": "The Canaanite languages , or Canaanite dialects , are one of the three subgroups of the Northwest Semitic languages , the others being Aramaic and Amorite . They were spoken by the ancient Semitic people of the Canaan and Levant regions , an area encompassing what is today Israel , Jordan , Sinai , Lebanon , Syria , the Palestinian territories and also some fringe areas of southern Turkey and the northern Arabian Peninsula . The Canaanites are broadly defined to include the Israelites ( including Judeans and Samaritans ) , Phoenicians ( including parts of Carthaginians ) , Amorites , Ammonites , Moabites , Edomites , Suteans , Ekronites and Amalekites . The Canaanite languages continued to be everyday spoken languages until at least the 4th century CE . Hebrew is the only living Canaanite language today , having remained in continuous use by many Jews well into the Middle Ages as a liturgical language , a literary language and for commerce . It was then revived as an everyday spoken language in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and became the main language of the Jews of Palestine and later the State of Israel . This family of languages has the distinction of being the first historically attested group of languages to use an alphabet , derived from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet , to record their writings , as opposed to the far earlier Cuneiform logographic/syllabic writing of the region . The primary reference for extra-biblical Canaanite inscriptions , together with Aramaic inscriptions , is the German-language book Kanaan\u00e4ische und Aram\u00e4ische Inschriften , from which inscriptions are often referenced as KAI n ( for a number n ) .",

It is the smallest Old Kingdom pyramid , but significant due to the discovery of Pyramid Texts , spells for the king 's afterlife incised into the walls of its subterranean chambers . Inscribed for the first time in Unas 's pyramid , the tradition of funerary texts carried on in the pyramids of subsequent rulers , through to the end of the Old Kingdom , and into the Middle Kingdom through the Coffin Texts that form the basis of the Book of the Dead . Unas built his pyramid between the complexes of Sekhemket and Djoser , in North Saqqara . Anchored to the valley temple at a nearby lake , a long causeway was constructed to provide access to the pyramid site . The causeway had elaborately decorated walls covered with a roof which had a slit in one section allowing light to enter , illuminating the images . A long wadi was used as a pathway . The terrain was difficult to negotiate and contained old buildings and tomb superstructures . These were torn down and repurposed as underlay for the causeway . A significant stretch of Djoser 's causeway was reused for embankments . Tombs that were on the path had their superstructures demolished and were paved over , preserving their decorations .

It is the earliest attested Semitic language . It used the cuneiform script , which was originally used to write the unrelated , and also extinct , Sumerian ( which is a language isolate ) . Akkadian is named after the city of Akkad , a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire ( c. 2334-2154 BC ) . The mutual influence between Sumerian and Akkadian had led scholars to describe the languages as a Sprachbund . Akkadian proper names were first attested in Sumerian texts from around the mid 3rd-millennium BC . From about the 25th or 24th century BC , texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear . By the 10th century BC , two variant forms of the language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia , known as Assyrian and Babylonian respectively . The bulk of preserved material is from this later period , corresponding to the Near Eastern Iron Age . In total , hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated , covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative , legal texts , scientific works , correspondence , political and military events , and many other examples . Akkadian ( in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties ) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ( Akkadian Empire , Old Assyrian Empire , Babylonia , Middle Assyrian Empire ) throughout the later Bronze Age , and Akkadian became the lingua franca of much of the Ancient Near East by the time of the Bronze Age collapse .

Its remains constitute a tell located 11 kilometers north-west of Abu Kamal on the Euphrates river western bank , some 120 kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor . It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900 BC and 1759 BC . As a purposely-built city , the existence of Mari was related to its position in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes ; this position made it an intermediary between Sumer in the south and the Levant in the west . Mari was first abandoned in the middle of the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East Semitic state before 2500 BC . This second Mari engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla and is known for its strong affinity with Sumerian culture . It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians , who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku ( military governor ) . The governors later became independent with the rapid disintegration of the Akkadian Empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley . The Shakkanakkus ruled Mari until the second half of the 19th century BC , when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons . A short time after the Shakkanakku collapse , Mari became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty . The Amorite Mari was short-lived as it was annexed by Babylonia in c. 1761 BC , but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period . The Mariotes worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and established their city as a center of old trade .",

The language , now long extinct , is attested in cuneiform , in records dating from the 16th ( Anitta text ) to the 13th centuries BCE , with isolated Hittite loanwords and numerous personal names appearing in an Old Assyrian context from as early as the 20th century BCE . By the Late Bronze Age , Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative Luwian . It appears that in the 13th century BCE , Luwian was the most-widely spoken language in the Hittite capital , Hattusa . After the collapse of the Hittite Empire during the more general Late Bronze Age collapse , Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states , in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria . Hittite is the earliest-attested of the Indo-European languages and is the best-known of the Anatolian languages .",

  "/wiki/Hittite_cuneiform": "Hittite cuneiform is the implementation of cuneiform script used in writing the Hittite language . The surviving corpus of Hittite texts is preserved in cuneiform on clay tablets dating to the 2nd millennium BC ( roughly spanning the 17th to 12th centuries BC ) . Hittite orthography was directly adapted from Old Assyrian cuneiform . The HZL of R\u00fcster and Neu lists 375 cuneiform signs used in Hittite documents ( 11 of them only appearing in Hurrian and Hattic glosses ) , compared to some 600 signs in use in Old Assyrian . About half of the signs have syllabic values , the remaining are used as ideograms or logograms to represent the entire word - much as the characters $ ,% and & are used in contemporary English . Cuneiform signs can be employed in three functions : syllabograms , Akkadograms or Sumerograms . Syllabograms are characters that represent a syllable . Akkadograms and Sumerograms are ideograms originally from the earlier Akkadian or Sumerian orthography respectively , but not intended to be pronounced as in the original language ; Sumerograms are mostly ideograms and determiners . Conventionally , Thus , the sign GI can be used ( and transcribed ) in three ways , as the Hittite syllable gi ( also ge ) ; in the Akkadian spelling Q\u00c8-RU-UB of the preposition near as Q\u00c8 , and as the Sumerian ideogram GI for tube also in superscript , , when used as a determiner .",

  "/wiki/Palaic_language": "Palaic is an extinct Indo-European language , attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa , the capital of the Hittites . Its name in Hittite is palaumnili , or of the people of Pala ; Pala was probably to the northwest of the Hittite core area , so in the northwest of present mainland Turkey . That region was overrun by the Kaskas in the 15th century BC , and the language likely went out of daily use at that time . [ citation needed ] The entire corpus of Palaic spans only CTH 751-754 in Emmanuel Laroche 's catalog of Hittite texts ; in addition Hittite texts elsewhere cite passages in Palaic in reference to the god Zaparwa ( Hittite Ziparwa ) , the leading God of the land of Pala . In particular , CTH 750 , a festival in Hittite for Ziparwa and associated deities , includes passages stating , The Old Woman speaks the words of the bread in Palaic , or alternately the words of the meal , though no Palaic passages are quoted . The Palaic-language texts are all from a religious context , with ritual and mythological content . In addition to Zaparwa , the Palaumnili-speakers worshipped a sky god Tiyaz ( Luwian Tiwaz ) . Palaic is a fairly typical specimen of Indo-European . Old Hittite has the genitive singular suffix -as circa 1600 BC ( compare Proto-Indo-European *-os ) ; where Cuneiform Luwian instead uses the -ssa adjectival suffix . Palaic , on the northern border of both , like later Hieroglyphic Luwian has both an -as genitive and an -asa adjectival suffix . Palaic also shows the same gender distinction as seen in Hittite , i.e . animate vs. inanimate ; and has similar pronoun forms .",

  "/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek_language": "Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language , on the Greek mainland , Crete and Cyprus in Mycenaean Greece ( 16th to 12th centuries BC ) , before the hypothesised Dorian invasion , often cited as the terminus ad quem for the introduction of the Greek language to Greece . The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B , a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century . Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos , in central Crete , as well as in Pylos , in the southwest of the Peloponnese . Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself , Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania , in Western Crete . The language is named after Mycenae , one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece . The tablets long remained undeciphered , and many languages were suggested for them , until Michael Ventris deciphered the script in 1952 . The texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories . No prose narrative survives , much less myth or poetry . Still , much may be glimpsed from these records about the people who produced them and about Mycenaean Greece , the period before the so-called Greek Dark Ages .",
  "/wiki/Linear_B": "Linear B is a syllabic script that was used for writing Mycenaean Greek , the earliest attested form of Greek . The script predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries . The oldest Mycenaean writing dates to about 1450 BC . It is descended from the older Linear A , an undeciphered earlier script used for writing the Minoan language , as is the later Cypriot syllabary , which also recorded Greek . Linear B , found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos , Cydonia , Pylos , Thebes and Mycenae , disappeared with the fall of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age collapse . The succeeding period , known as the Greek Dark Ages , provides no evidence of the use of writing . It is also the only one of the Bronze Age Aegean scripts to have been deciphered , by English architect and self-taught linguist Michael Ventris . Linear B consists of around 87 syllabic signs and over 100 ideographic signs . These ideograms or signifying signs symbolize objects or commodities . They have no phonetic value and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence . The application of Linear B appears to have been confined to administrative contexts .

Settled as early as the Neolithic period , the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete . The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture . The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age , c. 1,380-1,100 BC . The reason why is unknown , but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward . In the First Palace Period ( around 2,000 BC ) , the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people . In its peak , the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC .",

It is unknown what the native speakers of hattili called their own language . The heartland of the oldest attested language of Anatolia , before the arrival of Hittite-speakers , ranged from Hattusa , then called Hattus , northward to Nerik . Other cities mentioned in Hattic include Tuhumiyara and Tissaruliya . Hittite-speakers conquered Hattus from Kanesh to its south in the 18th century BC .

  "/wiki/Old_Chinese": "Old Chinese , also called Archaic Chinese in older works , is the oldest attested stage of Chinese , and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese . [ a ] The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BC , in the late Shang dynasty . Bronze inscriptions became plentiful during the following Zhou dynasty . The latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature , including classical works such as the Analects , the Mencius , and the Zuo zhuan . These works served as models for Literary Chinese ( or Classical Chinese ) , which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century , thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese . Old Chinese was written with several early forms of Chinese characters , including Oracle Bone , Bronze , and Seal scripts . Throughout the Old Chinese period , there was a close correspondence between a character and a monosyllabic and monomorphemic word . Although the script is not alphabetic , the majority of characters were created based on phonetic considerations . At first , words that were difficult to represent visually were written using a borrowed character for a similar-sounding word ( rebus principle ) . Later on , to reduce ambiguity , new characters were created for these phonetic borrowings by appending a radical that conveys a broad semantic category , resulting in compound xingsheng ( phono-semantic ) characters . For the earliest attested stage of Old Chinese of the late Shang dynasty , the phonetic information implicit in these xingsheng characters which are grouped into phonetic series , known as the xiesheng series , represents the only direct source of phonological data for reconstructing the language . The corpus of xingsheng characters was greatly expanded in the following Zhou dynasty .",
  "/wiki/Oracle_bone": "Oracle bones ( ) are pieces of ox scapula or turtle plastron , which were used for pyromancy - a form of divination - in ancient China , mainly during the late Shang dynasty . Scapulimancy is the correct term if ox scapulae were used for the divination , plastromancy if turtle plastrons were used . Diviners would submit questions to deities regarding future weather , crop planting , the fortunes of members of the royal family , military endeavors , and other similar topics . These questions were carved onto the bone or shell in oracle bone script using a sharp tool . Intense heat was then applied with a metal rod until the bone or shell cracked due to thermal expansion . The diviner would then interpret the pattern of cracks and write the prognostication upon the piece as well . Pyromancy with bones continued in China into the Zhou dynasty , but the questions and prognostications were increasingly written with brushes and cinnabar ink , which degraded over time . The oracle bones bear the earliest known significant corpus of ancient Chinese writing and contain important historical information such as the complete royal genealogy of the Shang dynasty . When they were discovered and deciphered in the early twentieth century , these records confirmed the existence of the Shang , which some scholars had until then doubted .",

Early bronze inscriptions were almost always cast ( that is , the writing was done with a stylus in the wet clay of the piece-mold from which the bronze was then cast ) , while later inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast . The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts , preceded by the oracle bone script .",
