  "/wiki/Borland_Racing_Developments": "Borland Racing Developments is an Australian championship winning manufacturer of open wheel racing cars , principally in the junior categories of Formula Ford and Formula Vee . Borland Racing Developments was formed in 1984 to prepare and engineer cars for the Australian Formula 2 Championship . Four championships were secured in the next five years , after which Michael Borland turned his attention to producing the Spectrum Formula Ford and Sabre Formula Vee racing cars . Past drivers who have partnered with BRD include Craig Lowndes , Jason Bright , Jason Bargwanna , Steven Richards , Mark Winterbottom , Shane Price and John Martin . The Spectrum chassis established itself in the local Formula Ford market , taking a second for Jason Bargwanna in the 1996 title race . He gained a 1-2 in the 1998 Australian Championship for Adam Macrow and Christian Jones . The strength and popularity of the chassis grew with ongoing development and since 2004 , the Spectrum has been the most consistently successful brand in Australian Formula Ford Championship racing . In 2000 , a New Zealand title to Phil Hellebrekers was the first international crown for the marque . In 2006 a Spectrum model 011 was built for the UK championship . On the Brands Hatch GP circuit , John Martin took a resounding victory in the chassis ' debut weekend . This win was the impetus to appoint a UK agent in Mark Bailey Racing Ltd , which culminated in leading UK championship team Kevin Mills Racing switching to the Spectrum chassis for the 2008 season . With pole positions and race wins with KMR in 2008 and 2009 , Spectrums are regular front runners in the UK championship .",

  "/wiki/Formula_Ford": "Formula Ford ( known as F1600 and Formula F in the United States because of a rule change in 2009 ) is an entry-level class of single seater , open-wheel formula racing . The various championships held across the world form an important step for many prospective Formula One drivers . Formula Ford has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone into formula racing after karting . The series typically sees professional career minded drivers enter alongside amateurs and enthusiasts . Success in Formula F can lead directly to other junior formulae such as a Formula Renault 2.0 and Formula Three . Formula Ford is not a one-make championship . It allows freedom of chassis design , engine build and numerous technical items of specification on the car . This opens the door to many chassis manufacturers , large and small . Many other single-seater formulae impose fixed specifications . Only two other professional single seater racing formulae in the world offer the same freedom of chassis and engine build : Formula Three and Formula One .",

Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs , such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever , facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive . Internationally , the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina , Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8 . Holden implemented a staged roll-out of the VE variants , releasing the sedan first in July 2006 . Prior to this , Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the new station wagon and utility body styles were launched .

Before 1993 , the E in Mercedes-Benz nomenclature was a suffix following a vehicle 's model number which stood for Einspritzmotor ( German for fuel injection engine ) . It began to appear in the early 1960s , when that feature began to be utilized broadly in the maker 's product line , and not just in its upper tier luxury and sporting models . By the launch of the facelifted W124 in 1993 fuel-injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines , and the E was adopted as a prefix ( i.e. , E 220 ) and the model line referred to officially as the E-Class ( or E-Klasse ) .

Historically , the E-Class is Mercedes-Benz ' best-selling model , with more than 13 million sold by 2015 .
