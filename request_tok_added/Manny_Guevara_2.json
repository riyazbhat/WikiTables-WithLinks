  "/wiki/ABC_Family": "Freeform is an American basic cable channel owned by Walt Disney Television , a unit of Disney Media Networks and a part of The Walt Disney Company . Freeform primarily broadcasts programming geared toward teenagers and young adults - with some programming skewing toward young women - in the 14-34 age range , a target demographic designated by the channel as becomers . Its programming includes contemporary off-network syndicated reruns and original series , feature films , and made-for-TV original movies . Since the network was launched on April 29 , 1977 , it has undergone different changes to its programming format and naming under its four different owners . The network was founded as a religious channel , the CBN Satellite Service - an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson 's Christian Broadcasting Network . It evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981 , and was spun off into a for-profit company known as International Family Entertainment ( IFE ) in 1990 , eventually becoming known as The Family Channel . As a condition of the spin-off , the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of The 700 Club and an annual telethon on the last Sunday in January ; these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel . In 1997 , IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between News Corporation and Saban Entertainment , resulting in its re-branding as the Fox Family Channel a year later . The new owners wanted to re-position the network towards younger viewers as a companion for their popular Fox Kids programming block . After the network began to struggle as a result of their changes , the venture was sold to Disney in October 2001 , in a sale that also included Saban ; the channel altered its name to ABC Family one month later on November 10 , 2001 . On October 6 , 2015 , Disney-ABC Television Group announced that the network would rebrand as Freeform , officially adopting that name on January 12 , 2016 .
