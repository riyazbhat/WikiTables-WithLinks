  "/wiki/Retired": "Retirement is the withdrawal from one 's position or occupation or from one 's active working life . A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours . An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement , by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement . Some people who have retired from a position with a pre-nominal title , particularly military officers , are often listed with a post-nominal indicating retirement , e.g. , Admiral John Smith ( ret ) ( or rtd or retd ) . Many people choose to retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits , although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer ( by illness or accident ) or as a result of legislation concerning their position . In most countries , the idea of retirement is of recent origin , being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Previously , low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death . Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889 . Nowadays , most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age , funded by employers or the state . In many poorer countries there is no support for the old beyond that provided through the family . Today , retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies ; hard ideological , social , cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right . In many western countries , this is a right embodied in national constitutions .",
