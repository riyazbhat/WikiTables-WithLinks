It is the administrative centre of Perth and Kinross council area and the historic county town of Perthshire . It had a population of about 47,180 in 2012 . Perth has been known as The Fair City since the publication of the story Fair Maid of Perth by Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott in 1828 . During the later medieval period the city was also called St John 's Toun or Saint Johnstoun by its inhabitants in reference to the main church dedicated to St John the Baptist . This name is preserved by the city 's football club , St Johnstone F.C . There has been a settlement at Perth since prehistoric times , on a natural mound raised slightly above the flood plain of the Tay , where the river could be crossed at low tide . The area surrounding the modern city is known to have been occupied since Mesolithic hunter-gatherers arrived more than 8,000 years ago . Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles also exist , dating from about 4000 BC , following the introduction of farming in the area . The presence of Scone Abbey , home of the Stone of Scone ( also known as the Stone of Destiny ) where the King of Scots was crowned , enhanced the early importance of the city . Perth became known as a 'capital ' of Scotland , due to the frequent residence of the royal court . Royal Burgh status was soon given to the city by King William the Lion in the early 12th century .",
