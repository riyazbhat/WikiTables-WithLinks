The town itself does n't have any buildings over 150 years old as two fires destroyed the town completely in 1866 . These fires could not be controlled due to the great number of hay stacks in one street , 'de Achterweg ' or 'Nachtweg ' . This street still holds a non smoking sign , which is unique for a street in Europe . Since the 18th century , the people from Genemuiden have been producing floor mats made of the bulrush that grows on the shores of the Zuiderzee . When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century , due to the change from salt water to fresh water ( see Zuiderzee ) , the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets . In the sixties the first tufting machines were imported and currently Genemuiden is one of Europe 's main production centres of tufted carpet and artificial grass .

In 1939 , a dike from the mainland to Urk ended the town 's island status , just as the Afsluitdijk project was changing the salt water Zuiderzee surrounding Urk to the less saline IJsselmeer . Later in the 20th century , seabed areas surrounding Urk were reclaimed from the sea and became the Noordoostpolder . The mainstay of the town 's economy has always been fishing , and the products of the sea coming in through Urk 's harbour continue to be exported widely , although today Urk 's fishing boats must travel greater distances to gather them than was required in most historical periods . Religious life has also traditionally been very important to Urk 's inhabitants , with active , conservative congregations of the Dutch Reformed denominations playing key roles in the life of the community .",
