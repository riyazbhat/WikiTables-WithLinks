  "/wiki/ITV_Network": "ITV is a British free-to-air television network with its headquarters in London . It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television , under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) ( later the Independent Broadcasting Authority , after the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 , and currently Ofcom ) , to provide competition to BBC Television which had been established in 1932 . ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV . STV Group plc uses the STV brand for its two franchises of central and northern Scotland .",

Born in Swansea , Davies aspired to work as a comic artist in his adult life , until a careers advisor at Olchfa School suggested he study English literature ; he consequently focused on a career of play- and screen-writing . After he graduated from Oxford University , Davies joined the BBC 's children 's department in 1985 on a part-time basis and worked in varying positions , which included writing and producing two series , Dark Season and Century Falls . He left the BBC in the early 1990s to work for Granada Television and later became a freelance writer . Davies moved into writing adult television dramas in 1994 . His early scripts generally explored concepts of religion and sexuality among various backdrops : Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar ; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool ; The Grand explored society 's opinion of subjects such as prostitution , abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period ; and Queer as Folk recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene . His later adult-oriented series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose , which portrayed a gay man who fell in love with a woman ; The Second Coming , which focused on the second coming and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view ; Mine All Mine , a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea ; and Casanova , an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova . Davies revived and ran Doctor Who after a sixteen-year hiatus , with Christopher Eccleston , and later David Tennant , in the title role .

  "/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)": "ITV is a British free-to-air television network with its headquarters in London . It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television , under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) ( later the Independent Broadcasting Authority , after the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 , and currently Ofcom ) , to provide competition to BBC Television which had been established in 1932 . ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV . STV Group plc uses the STV brand for its two franchises of central and northern Scotland .",
