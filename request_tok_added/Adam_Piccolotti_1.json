Prior to 2015 , when president Scott Coker made the decision to drop the 8-man tournament format , Bellator fighters participated in a series of tournament bouts in a set weight class over a season ( usually between 10 and 13 events over 3 or 4 months ) . The winners of these tournaments were crowned Bellator champions , with the winners of successive tournaments in the same weight class earning the spot of no . 1 contender . This list is an up-to-date roster of those fighters currently under contract with the Bellator brand . Unlike the UFC , Bellator does allow its fighters to compete in other promotions , so many fighters on this list may appear in MMA events outside of Bellator .

Fighters with the same MMA record are listed alphabetically . Each fight record has four categories : wins , losses , draws , and no-contests .
