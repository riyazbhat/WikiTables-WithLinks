  "/wiki/Pedes": "The foot is the basic repeating rhythmic unit that forms part of a line of verse in most Indo-European traditions of poetry , including English accentual-syllabic verse and the quantitative meter of classical ancient Greek and Latin poetry . The unit is composed of syllables , and is usually two , three , or four syllables in length . The most common feet in English are the iamb , trochee , dactyl , and anapest . The foot might be compared to a bar , or a beat divided into pulse groups , in musical notation . The English word foot is a translation of the Latin term pes , plural pedes , which in turn is a translation of the Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 , pl . \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 . The Ancient Greek prosodists , who invented this terminology , specified that a foot must have both an arsis and a thesis , that is , a place where the foot was raised ( arsis ) and where it was put down ( thesis ) in beating time or in marching or dancing . The Greeks recognised three basic types of feet , the iambic ( where the ratio of arsis to thesis was 1:2 ) , the dactylic ( where it was 2:2 ) and the paeonic ( where it was 3:2 ) . Lines of verse are classified according to the number of feet they contain , e.g . pentameter . However some lines of verse are not considered to be made up of feet , e.g . hendecasyllable .",
  "/wiki/Private_(rank)": "A private is a soldier of the lowest military rank ( equivalent to NATO Rank Grades OR-1 to OR-3 depending on the force served in ) . In modern military writing , private is abridged to Pte in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth of Nations countries and to Pvt in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Cornicen": "A cornicen ( plural cornicines ) was a junior officer in the Roman Army . The cornicen 's job was to signal salutes to officers and sound orders to the legions . The cornicines played the cornu ( making him an aeneator ) . Cornicines always marched at the head of the centuries , with the tesserary and the signifer . The cornicines were also used as assistants to a centurion ( like an optio ) . The cornicen was a duplicary or a soldier who got double the basic pay of the legionary .",
  "/wiki/Tesserarius": "A tesserarius ( , from tessera , a small tile or block of wood on which watchwords were written ) , was a watch commander in the Roman army . They organized and had command over the nightly guard assigned to keep watch over the fort when in garrison or on campaign and were responsible for getting the watchwords from the commander and seeing that they were kept safe . There was one tesserarius to each centuria ( Wilkes , 1972 ) . They held a position similar to that of a First Sergeant of a Company in modern armies and acted as seconds to the optiones . Tesserary pay was one and a half times ( sesquiplicarii ) that of the standard legionary pay .",
  "/wiki/Corporal": "Corporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations . Within NATO , each member nation 's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-3 or OR-4 . However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) . In most countries that derive their military structure from the British military system , corporal is a more senior rank than that of private .",
  "/wiki/Optio": "An optio , plural optiones ( , opti\u014dn\u0113s , from opt\u0101re , to choose , so-called because an optio was chosen by a centurion ) and sometimes , albeit rarely , anglicised as option - was a position in a centuria ( century ) of a Roman army similar to that of an executive officer . The main function of an optio was as an optio centuriae , the second-in-command of a century , although there were many other roles an optio could adopt . Optiones were vital in the Roman army . An optio was stationed at the rear of the ranks to keep the troops in order . Their duties would include enforcing the orders of the centurion , taking over the centurion 's command in battle should the need arise , supervising his subordinates , and a variety of administration duties . Optio pay was double the standard legionary pay and they were the most likely men to replace the centurion if the position became vacant .",
  "/wiki/Signifer": "A signifer was a standard bearer of the Roman legions . He carried a signum ( standard ) for a cohort or century . Each century had a signifer so there were 59 in a legion . Within each cohort , the first century 's signifer would be the senior one .",
  "/wiki/Imaginifer": "The imaginifer was one of the signiferi in a legion in the times of the Roman Empire , who carried the imago - the image - of the emperor . The imaginifer was added to the ranks of the legions when the Imperial Cult was first established during the reign of Augustus . The image was a three-dimensional portrait made from beaten metal . It was carried only in the leading cohort .",
  "/wiki/Aquilifer": "An aquilifer was a soldier signifer bearing the eagle standard of a Roman legion . The name derives from the type of standard , aquila meaning eagle ( which was the universal type used since 106 BC ) , and fers , related to the Latin word for bringing or carrying . Before that time , the wolf , boar , bull and horse were also used . The eagle standard was the most important possession of the legion , and its loss was a terrible disgrace . The aquila emblem generally had up-raised wings surrounded by a laurel wreath . It was mounted on a narrow trapezoidal base and mounted on a pole that was held aloft . The aquilifer 's position was accordingly one of enormous prestige , and he was ranked immediately below the centurions and above the optiones , receiving twice the pay of an ordinary legionary . Aquilifer carried a small circular shield called a parma that could be strapped on if his hands were already full . Aquilifers were very easily recognizable not only because of their standard but because they always wore a type of fur : as wolf fur was worn by the vexillarius and bear fur by the signifer , a lion fur was given to the aquilifers . The furs were worn as capes with the head of the animal strapped to the helmet of the bearer .",
  "/wiki/Sergeant": "Sergeant ( /\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0 ( r ) d\u0292\u0259nt/ SARJ-\u0259nt ; abbreviated to Sgt . and capitalized when used as a named person 's title ) is a rank in many uniformed organizations , principally military and policing forces . The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language . The equivalent rank in Arab armies is raq\u012bb ( \u0631\u0642\u064a\u0628 ) , meaning 'overseer ' or 'watcher ' .",
  "/wiki/Centurion": "A centurion ( ; ; , kentyr\u00ed\u014dn or , hekat\u00f3ntarkhos ) was a professional officer of the Roman army after the Marian reforms of 107 BC . Centurions originally commanded a hundred men ( a century ) of around 80 legionaries , with the other 20 being servants and orderlies , but senior centurions commanded cohorts or took senior staff roles in their legion . Centurions were also found in the Roman navy . In the Byzantine Army , they were also known by the name kentarch ( , kentarchos ) . Their symbol of office was the vine staff , with which they disciplined even Roman citizens protected from other forms of beating by the Porcian Laws .",

  "/wiki/Company_sergeant-major": "The Company Sergeant Major ( CSM ) is the senior non-commissioned soldier of a company in the armies of many Commonwealth countries , responsible for administration , standards and discipline . In combat , his prime responsibility is the supply of ammunition to the company . He also oversees the distribution of other supplies , such as water or food , although that responsibility is mainly that of the company quartermaster sergeant ( CQMS ) , and evacuating the wounded and collecting prisoners of war . For military units of the same level as a company , the equivalent may be squadron sergeant major ( SSM ) or battery sergeant major ( BSM ) . In the Household Cavalry , squadron corporal major ( SCM ) is the equivalent . First sergeant and Kompaniefeldwebel ( formerly Hauptfeldwebel in the Wehrmacht and Nationale Volksarmee ) are the United States Army and German Heer equivalents respectively .",
  "/wiki/Regimental_sergeant-major": "Regimental sergeant major ( RSM ) is an appointment that may be held by warrant officers class 1 ( WO1 ) in the British Army , the British Royal Marines and in the armies of many Commonwealth and former Commonwealth nations , including Australia , Kenya and New Zealand . It is also an appointment that may be held by chief warrant officers ( CWO ) in the Canadian Forces and warrant officers of any grade in the Singapore Armed Forces , and is a rank in itself in the Irish Defence Forces and formerly in the British Army , Royal Marines and United States Army . Only one warrant officer holds the appointment of RSM in a regiment or battalion , making him the senior warrant officer ; in a unit with more than one WO1 , the RSM is considered to be first amongst equals . The RSM is primarily responsible for maintaining standards and discipline and acts as a parental figure to their subordinates and also to junior officers , even though they technically outrank the RSM .",
  "/wiki/Tribunus_militum": "A military tribune ( Latin tribunus militum , tribune of the soldiers , Greek chiliarchos , \u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) was an officer of the Roman army who ranked below the legate and above the centurion . Young men of Equestrian rank often served as military tribune as a stepping stone to the Senate . The tribunus militum should not be confused with the elected political office of tribune of the people ( tribunus plebis ) nor with that of tribunus militum consulari potestate .",
  "/wiki/Colonel": "Colonel ( /\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0rn\u0259l/ kernel ; abbreviated Col. , Col or COL ) is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks . However , in some small military forces , such as those of Monaco or the Vatican , colonel is the highest rank . It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations . Historically , in the seventeenth , eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army . Modern usage varies greatly , and in some cases , the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military service . The rank of colonel is typically above the rank of lieutenant colonel . The rank above colonel is typically called brigadier , brigade general or brigadier general . Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain . In the Commonwealth air force rank system , the equivalent rank is group captain .",
  "/wiki/Praefectus_castrorum": "The praefectus castrorum ( camp prefect ) was , in the Roman army of the early Empire , the third most senior commander of the Roman legion after the legate ( legatus ) and the senior military tribune ( tribunus laticlavius ) . His responsibility was looking after equipment and building works but he could command the legion when his seniors were absent . The post was usually held by men coming from the ranks of the centurionate , having already served as chief centurions ( primus pilus ) of a legion , and was therefore open to ordinary citizens . A camp prefect 's job was to maintain and update the equipment , organize the legion , and make sure that the soldiers were properly trained . Prefects of this rank , including Sextus Vibius Gallus , were awarded prizes ( dona ) to mark their achievements .",
  "/wiki/Legatus": "A legatus ( anglicised as legate ) was a high-ranking Roman military officer in the Roman Army , equivalent to a modern high-ranking general officer . Initially used to delegate power , the term became formalised under Augustus as the officer in command of a legion . From the times of the Roman Republic , legates received large shares of the military 's rewards at the end of a successful campaign . This made the position a lucrative one , so it could often attract even distinguished consuls or other high-ranking political figures within Roman politics ( e.g. , the consul Lucius Julius Caesar volunteered late in the Gallic Wars as a legate under his first cousin once removed , Gaius Julius Caesar ) .",
  "/wiki/General": "A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army , and in some nations ' air forces or marines . [ a ] The term general is used in two ways : as the generic title for all grades of general officer and as a specific rank . It originates in the 16th century , as a shortening of captain general , which rank was taken from Middle French capitaine g\u00e9n\u00e9ral . The adjective general had been affixed to officer designations since the late medieval period to indicate relative superiority or an extended jurisdiction . Today , the title of general is known in some countries as a four-star rank . However , different countries use different systems of stars or other insignia for senior ranks . It has a NATO code of OF-9 and is the highest rank currently in use in a number of armies , air forces and marine organizations ."
