  "/wiki/Charles_II_of_England": "Charles II ( 29 May 1630 - 6 February 1685 ) [ c ] was king of England , Scotland , and Ireland . He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651 , and king of England , Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death in 1685 . Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England , Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France . After Charles I 's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War , the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649 . However , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland . Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands . A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 . Charles 's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code , designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England .",
  "/wiki/St._James's_Palace": "St James 's Palace is the most senior royal palace in the United Kingdom . Located in the City of Westminster , although no longer the principal residence of the monarch , it is the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council and the London residence of several minor members of the royal family . Built by King Henry VIII on the site of a leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less , the palace was secondary in importance to the Palace of Whitehall for most Tudor and Stuart monarchs . The palace increased in importance during the reigns of the early Georgian monarchy , but was displaced by Buckingham Palace in the late-18th and early-19th centuries . After decades of being used increasingly for only formal occasions , the move was formalised by Queen Victoria in 1837 . Today the palace houses a number of official offices , societies and collections , and all ambassadors and high commissioners to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the Court of St James 's . The palace 's Chapel Royal is still used for functions of the British royal family . Mainly built between 1531 and 1536 in red-brick , the palace 's architecture is primarily Tudor in style . A fire in 1809 destroyed parts of the structure , including the monarch 's private apartments , which were never replaced . Some 17th-century interiors survive , but most were remodelled in the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Charles_I_of_England": "Charles I ( 19 November 1600 - 30 January 1649 ) [ a ] was King of England , King of Scotland , and King of Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649 . Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 ( as James I ) , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War .",
  "/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France": "Henrietta Maria of France ( ; 25 November 1609 - 10 September 1669 ) was queen consort of England , Scotland , and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I . She was mother of his two immediate successors , Charles II and James II and VII . Contemporaneously , by a decree of her husband , she was known in England as Queen Mary , but did not like this name and signed her letters Henriette R. Her Roman Catholicism made her unpopular in England , and also prohibited her from being crowned in a Church of England service ; therefore she never had a coronation . She began to immerse herself in national affairs as civil war loomed on the horizon , and was compelled to seek refuge in France in 1644 , following the birth of her youngest daughter , Henrietta , during the height of the First English Civil War . The execution of King Charles in 1649 left her impoverished . She settled in Paris , and then returned to England after the Restoration of her eldest son , Charles , to the throne . In 1665 , she moved back to Paris , where she died four years later . The North American Province of Maryland , a major haven for Roman Catholic settlers , was named in her honour . The name was carried over into the current U.S. state of Maryland .",

She was the daughter of King John IV , who became the first king of Portugal from the House of Braganza in 1640 after overthrowing the rule of the Spanish Habsburgs over Portugal . Catherine served as regent of Portugal during the absence of her brother in 1701 and during 1704-1705 , after her return to her homeland as a widow . Owing to her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith in which she had been raised , Catherine was unpopular in England . She was a special object of attack by the inventors of the Popish Plot . In 1678 the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey was ascribed to her servants , and Titus Oates accused her of an intention to poison the king . These charges , the absurdity of which was soon shown by cross-examination , nevertheless placed the queen for some time in great danger . On 28 November Oates accused her of high treason , and the English House of Commons passed an order for the removal of her and of all Roman Catholics from the Palace of Whitehall . Several further depositions were made against her , and in June 1679 it was decided that she should stand trial , which threat however was lifted by the king 's intervention , for which she later showed him much gratitude . She produced no heirs for the king , having suffered three miscarriages . Her husband kept many mistresses , most notably Barbara Palmer , whom Catherine was forced to accept as one of her Ladies of the Bedchamber . By his mistresses Charles fathered numerous illegitimate offspring , which he acknowledged .",

This article deals with the most senior figures who were descended from Charles 's illegitimate sons ; the names of his daughters are also mentioned . Although some of Charles 's children made claims to the throne , most notably his first son James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth , their illegitimacy meant that after Charles 's death , his brother James , Duke of York , became king . Over the centuries , several of Charles 's descendants have made names for themselves , including Augustus FitzRoy , 3rd Duke of Grafton , who became Prime Minister of Great Britain , the cricket pioneer Charles Lennox , 1st Duke of Richmond , and the parliamentary reformer Charles Lennox , 3rd Duke of Richmond . Diana , Princess of Wales , was descended from two of Charles 's illegitimate sons ; Henry Fitzroy , 1st Duke of Grafton , and Charles Lennox , 1st Duke of Richmond .

Historically the area lay within St Margaret 's parish , City and Liberty of Westminster , Middlesex . The name Westminster ( Old English : Westmynstre ) originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter 's ( Westminster Abbey ) , literally West of the City of London ( indeed , until the Reformation there was a reference to the 'East Minster ' at Minories ( Holy Trinity Priory , Aldgate ) east of the City ) . The abbey was part of the royal palace that had been created here by Edward the Confessor . It has been the home of the permanent institutions of England 's government continuously since about 1200 ( High Middle Ages ' Plantagenet times ) , and from 1707 the British Government . In a government context , Westminster often refers to the Parliament of the United Kingdom , located in the UNESCO World Heritage Palace of Westminster - also known as the Houses of Parliament .

Her influence was so great that she has been referred to as The Uncrowned Queen . Barbara was the subject of many portraits , in particular by court painter Sir Peter Lely . Her extravagance , bad temper , adultery with the king , and influence at court provoked the diarist John Evelyn to describe her as the curse of the nation , whereas Samuel Pepys often wrote admiringly of seeing her .

  "/wiki/Anthony_Eden": "Robert Anthony Eden , 1st Earl of Avon , KG , MC , PC ( 12 June 1897 - 14 January 1977 ) was a British Conservative politician who served three periods as Foreign Secretary and then a relatively brief term as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955 to 1957 . Achieving rapid promotion as a young Member of Parliament , he became Foreign Secretary aged 38 , before resigning in protest at Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement policy towards Mussolini 's Italy . He again held that position for most of the Second World War , and a third time in the early 1950s . Having been deputy to Winston Churchill for almost 15 years , he succeeded him as the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister in April 1955 , and a month later won a general election . Eden 's worldwide reputation as an opponent of appeasement , a man of peace , and a skilled diplomat was overshadowed in 1956 when the United States refused to support the Anglo-French military response to the Suez Crisis , which critics across party lines regarded as an historic setback for British foreign policy , signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East . Most historians argue that he made a series of blunders , especially not realising the depth of American opposition to military action . Two months after ordering an end to the Suez operation , he resigned as prime minister on grounds of ill health and because he was widely suspected of having misled the House of Commons over the degree of collusion with France and Israel . Eden is generally ranked among the least successful British prime ministers of the 20th century , although two broadly sympathetic biographies ( in 1986 and 2003 ) have gone some way to shifting the balance of opinion . Biographer D. R. Thorpe described the Suez Crisis as a truly tragic end to his premiership , and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career .",

  "/wiki/David_Cameron": "David William Donald Cameron ( born 9 October 1966 ) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016 . He was the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016 . He identifies as a one-nation conservative , and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies . Born in London to an upper-middle-class family , Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School , Eton College , and Brasenose College , Oxford . From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department , latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major , before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994 . Becoming an MP in 2001 , he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard , and succeeded Howard in 2005 . Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives , embracing an increasingly socially liberal position . The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats - the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s . His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis ; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures . His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare , immigration policy , education , and healthcare . It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets , and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales . Internationally , his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; domestically , his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum , both of which confirmed Cameron 's favoured outcome .",
