  "/wiki/Constellation": "A constellation is an area on the celestial sphere in which a group of stars forms an imaginary outline or pattern , typically representing an animal , mythological person or creature , a god , or an inanimate object . The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to prehistory . People used them to relate stories of their beliefs , experiences , creation , or mythology . Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations , some of which lasted into the early 20th century before today 's constellations were internationally recognized . The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time . Many have changed in size or shape . Some became popular , only to drop into obscurity . Others were limited to a single culture or nation . The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek . They are given in Aratus ' work Phenomena and Ptolemy 's Almagest , though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries . Constellations in the far southern sky were added from the 15th century until the mid-18th century when European explorers began traveling to the Southern Hemisphere . Twelve ancient constellations belong to the zodiac ( straddling the ecliptic , which the Sun , Moon , and planets all traverse ) .",
  "/wiki/Right_ascension": "Right ascension ( abbreviated RA ; symbol ) is the angular distance of a particular point measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the ( hour circle of the ) point in question above the earth . When paired with declination , these astronomical coordinates specify the direction of a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system . An old term , right ascension ( ) refers to the ascension , or the point on the celestial equator that rises with any celestial object as seen from Earth 's equator , where the celestial equator intersects the horizon at a right angle . It contrasts with oblique ascension , the point on the celestial equator that rises with any celestial object as seen from most latitudes on Earth , where the celestial equator intersects the horizon at an oblique angle .",
  "/wiki/J2000": "In astronomy , an epoch is a moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity , such as the celestial coordinates or elliptical orbital elements of a celestial body , because these are subject to perturbations and vary with time . These time-varying astronomical quantities might include , for example , the mean longitude or mean anomaly of a body , the node of its orbit relative to a reference plane , the direction of the apogee or aphelion of its orbit , or the size of the major axis of its orbit . The main use of astronomical quantities specified in this way is to calculate other relevant parameters of motion , in order to predict future positions and velocities . The applied tools of the disciplines of celestial mechanics or its subfield orbital mechanics ( for predicting orbital paths and positions for bodies in motion under the gravitational effects of other bodies ) can be used to generate an ephemeris , a table of values giving the positions and velocities of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times . Astronomical quantities can be specified in any of several ways , for example , as a polynomial function of the time-interval , with an epoch as a temporal point of origin ( this is a common current way of using an epoch ) . Alternatively , the time-varying astronomical quantity can be expressed as a constant , equal to the measure that it had at the epoch , leaving its variation over time to be specified in some other way - for example , by a table , as was common during the 17th and 18th centuries . The word epoch was often used in a different way in older astronomical literature , e.g . during the 18th century , in connection with astronomical tables . At that time , it was customary to denote as epochs , not the standard date and time of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities , but rather the values at that date and time of those time-varying quantities themselves . In accordance with that alternative historical usage , an expression such as 'correcting the epochs ' would refer to the adjustment , usually by a small amount , of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard date and time of reference ( and not , as might be expected from current usage , to a change from one date and time of reference to a different date and time ) .",
  "/wiki/Declination": "In astronomy , declination ( abbreviated dec ; symbol \u03b4 ) is one of the two angles that locate a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system , the other being hour angle . Declination 's angle is measured north or south of the celestial equator , along the hour circle passing through the point in question . The root of the word declination ( Latin , declinatio ) means a bending away or a bending down . It comes from the same root as the words incline ( bend toward ) and recline ( bend backward ) . In some 18th and 19th century astronomical texts , declination is given as North Pole Distance ( N.P.D . ) , which is equivalent to 90 - ( declination ) . For instance an object marked as declination -5 would have a NPD of 95 , and a declination of -90 ( the south celestial pole ) would have a NPD of 180 .",
  "/wiki/Apparent_magnitude": "Apparent magnitude ( m ) is the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from the Earth . An object 's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity , its distance from Earth , and any extinction of the object 's light by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer . The magnitude scale is reverse logarithmic . An object with a magnitude 5 higher than another 's magnitude is 100 times dimmer . Consequently , a difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of 5\u221a100 or about 2.512 . The brighter an object is , the lower its magnitude . For example , a star of magnitude 2.0 is 2.512 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3.0 , or 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 7.0 . The brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes : for example , Venus at \u22124.2 or Sirius at \u22121.46 . The faintest naked-eye stars visible on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about +6.5 . The apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the Sun at \u221226.7 to objects in deep Hubble Space Telescope images of around magnitude +30 . The measurement of apparent magnitude is called photometry . Photometric measurements are made in the ultraviolet , visible , or infrared wavelength bands using standard passband filters belonging to photometric systems such as the UBV system or the Str\u00f6mgren uvby\u03b2 system .",
  "/wiki/NGC_5101": "NGC 5101 is a lenticular galaxy in the constellation Hydra . It is separated in the sky from the spiral galaxy NGC 5078 by about 0.5 degrees , and both are believed to be at the same distance from the Earth . This would mean they are approximately 800,000 light-years apart . Both galaxies are believed to be about the size of the Milky Way .",
  "/wiki/Spiral_galaxy": "Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae and , as such , form part of the Hubble sequence . Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat , rotating disk containing stars , gas and dust , and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge . These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars , many of which reside in globular clusters . Spiral galaxies are named by their spiral structures that extend from the center into the galactic disc . The spiral arms are sites of ongoing star formation and are brighter than the surrounding disc because of the young , hot OB stars that inhabit them . Roughly two-thirds of all spirals are observed to have an additional component in the form of a bar-like structure , extending from the central bulge , at the ends of which the spiral arms begin . The proportion of barred spirals relative to their barless cousins has likely changed over the history of the Universe , with only about 10% containing bars about 8 billion years ago , to roughly a quarter 2.5 billion years ago , until present , where over two-thirds of the galaxies in the visible universe ( Hubble volume ) have bars . The Milky Way is a barred spiral , although the bar itself is difficult to observe from Earth 's current position within the galactic disc . The most convincing evidence for the stars forming a bar in the galactic center comes from several recent surveys , including the Spitzer Space Telescope . Together with irregular galaxies , spiral galaxies make up approximately 60% of galaxies in today 's universe . They are mostly found in low-density regions and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters .",

  "/wiki/Lenticular_galaxy": "A lenticular galaxy ( denoted S0 ) is a type of galaxy intermediate between an elliptical ( denoted E ) and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes . It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms . Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation . They may , however , retain significant dust in their disks . As a result , they consist mainly of aging stars ( like elliptical galaxies ) . Despite the morphological differences , lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations . Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving , at least in the local part of the Universe . Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs .",
  "/wiki/Centaurus": "Centaurus is a bright constellation in the southern sky . One of the largest constellations , Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy , and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations .

  "/wiki/NGC_5128": "Centaurus A or NGC 5128 is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus . It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta , in New South Wales , Australia . There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy 's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type ( lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy ) and distance ( 10-16 million light-years ) . NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth , so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers . The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky , making it an ideal amateur astronomy target , although the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere . The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 55 million solar masses , which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths . By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade , astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light . X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles . The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long , while the radio jets are over a million light-years long . Like other starburst galaxies , a collision is suspected to be responsible for the intense burst of star formation . Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided and merged with a smaller spiral galaxy .",
  "/wiki/NGC_5139": "Omega Centauri ( \u03c9 Cen or NGC 5139 ) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Centaurus that was first identified as a non-stellar object by Edmond Halley in 1677 .

It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars and a total mass equivalent to 4 million solar masses , making it the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way . Omega Centauri is so distinctive from the other galactic globular clusters that it is thought to have an alternative origin as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
  "/wiki/Globular_cluster": "A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core . Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity , which gives them their spherical shapes , and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers . The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin , globulus - a small sphere . Occasionally , a globular cluster is known simply as a globular . Globular clusters are found in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars , and are much older than the less dense open clusters , which are found in the disk of a galaxy . Globular clusters are fairly common ; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way , with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered . Larger galaxies can have more : The Andromeda Galaxy , for instance , may have as many as 500 . Some giant elliptical galaxies ( particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters ) , such as M87 , have as many as 13,000 globular clusters . Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters , and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to possess a system of globular clusters . The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy , and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters ( such as Palomar 12 ) to the Milky Way . This demonstrates how many of this galaxy 's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past . Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy , their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear .",

  "/wiki/Ursa_Major": "Ursa Major ( ; also known as the Great Bear ) is a constellation in the northern sky , whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory . Its Latin name means greater ( or larger ) she-bear , referring to and contrasting it with nearby Ursa Minor , the lesser bear . In antiquity , it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD . Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations . Ursa Major is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven stars , which has been called the Big Dipper , the Wagon , Charles 's Wain , or the Plough , among other names . In particular , the Big Dipper 's stellar configuration mimics the shape of the Little Dipper . Two of its stars , named Dubhe and Merak ( \u03b1 Ursae Majoris and \u03b2 Ursae Majoris ) , can be used as the navigational pointer towards the place of the current northern pole star , Polaris in Ursa Minor . Ursa Major , along with asterisms that incorporate or comprise it , is significant to numerous world cultures , often as a symbol of the north . Its depiction on the flag of Alaska is a modern example of such symbolism . Ursa Major is visible throughout the year from most of the northern hemisphere , and appears circumpolar above the mid-northern latitudes . From southern temperate latitudes , the main asterism is invisible , but the southern parts of the constellation can still be viewed .",

  "/wiki/NGC_5189": "NGC 5189 ( Gum 47 , IC 4274 , nicknamed Spiral Planetary Nebula ) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Musca . It was discovered by James Dunlop on 1 July 1826 , who catalogued it as \u0394252 . For many years , well into the 1960s , it was thought to be a bright emission nebula . It was Karl Gordon Henize in 1967 who first described NGC 5189 as quasi-planetary based on its spectral emissions . Seen through the telescope it seems to have an S shape , reminiscent of a barred spiral galaxy . The S shape , together with point-symmetric knots in the nebula , have for a long time hinted to astronomers that a binary central star is present . The Hubble Space Telescope imaging analysis showed that this S shape structure is indeed two dense low-ionization regions : one moving toward the north-east and another one moving toward the south-west of the nebula , which could be a result of a recent outburst from the central star . Observations with the Southern African Large Telescope have finally found a white dwarf companion in a 4.04 day orbit around the rare low-mass Wolf-Rayet type central star of NGC 5189 . NGC 5189 is estimated to be 546 parsecs or 1,780 light years away from Earth . Other measurements have yielded results up to 900 parsecs ( ~3000 light-years )",
  "/wiki/Planetary_nebula": "A planetary nebula , abbreviated as PN or plural PNe , is a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding , glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives . The term planetary nebula is a misnomer because they are unrelated to planets or exoplanets . The term originates from the planet-like round shape of these nebulae observed by astronomers through early telescopes . The first usage may have occurred during the 1780s with the English astronomer William Herschel who described these nebulae as resembling planets ; however , as early as January 1779 , the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix described in his observations of the Ring Nebula , very dim but perfectly outlined ; it is as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet . Though the modern interpretation is different , the old term is still used . All planetary nebulae form at the end of the life of a star of intermediate mass , about 1-8 solar masses . They are a relatively short-lived phenomenon , lasting perhaps a few tens of thousands of years , compared to considerably longer phases of stellar evolution . Once all of the red giant 's atmosphere has been dissipated , energetic ultraviolet radiation from the exposed hot luminous core , called a planetary nebula nucleus ( PNN ) , ionizes the ejected material . Absorbed ultraviolet light then energizes the shell of nebulous gas around the central star , causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula . Planetary nebulae likely play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way by expelling elements into the interstellar medium from stars where those elements were created . Planetary nebulae are observed in more distant galaxies , yielding useful information about their chemical abundances . Starting from the 1990s , Hubble Space Telescope images revealed that many planetary nebulae have extremely complex and varied morphologies .",
  "/wiki/Musca": "Musca ( ) is a small constellation in the deep southern sky . It was one of 12 constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman , and it first appeared on a celestial globe in diameter published in 1597 ( or 1598 ) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius . The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer 's Uranometria of 1603 . It was also known as Apis ( ) for 200 years . Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers . Many of the constellation 's brighter stars are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association , a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appears to share a common origin and motion across the Milky Way . These include Alpha , Beta , Gamma , Zeta and ( probably ) Eta Muscae , as well as HD 100546 , a blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star that is surrounded by a complex debris disk containing a large planet or brown dwarf and possible protoplanet . Two further star systems have been found to have planets . The constellation also contains two cepheid variables visible to the naked eye .
