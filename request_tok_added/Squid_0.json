It is the only species of the genus Dosidicus of the subfamily Ommastrephinae , family Ommastrephidae . Humboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of . They have a reputation for aggression towards humans , though this behavior may possibly only be manifested during feeding times . Like other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae , they possess bioluminescent photophores and are capable of quickly changing body coloration ( metachrosis ) . They notably rapidly flash red and white while hunting , earning them the name diablo rojo ( Spanish for red devil ) among fishermen . These chromatophores ( which belong to more than one set and are of different sizes ) may rapidly cycle through colors other than red and white , flashing too quickly for the human eye to see the transitions . They have a relatively short lifespan of just 1-2 years . They are most commonly found at depths of , from Tierra del Fuego to California .
