According to the 2011 Indian census , it is the seventh most populous city ; the city had a population of 4.5 million , while the suburb population brought the total to 14.1 million , making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India . Kolkata Megalopolis is the area surrounding Kolkata Metropolitan city with additional population . Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west of the border with Bangladesh , it is the principal commercial , cultural , and educational centre of East India , while the Port of Kolkata is India 's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port . The city , nicknamed the City of Joy is widely regarded as the cultural capital of India and as of 2019 , six Nobel Laureates have been associated with the city . Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area 's economy have ranged from $ 60 to $ 150 billion ( GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity ) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India , after Mumbai and Delhi . In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics .",
