  "/wiki/Cartier_Field": "Cartier Field was a stadium in Notre Dame , Indiana . It hosted the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1900 to 1928 , and held nearly 30,000 people at its peak . The stands were torn down after the 1928 season to make room for Notre Dame Stadium , which opened in 1930 . Notre Dame played its entire 1929 schedule away from campus ( home games were at Chicago 's Soldier Field ) , but nevertheless went 9-0 and won the National Championship . At Coach Knute Rockne 's insistence , Cartier Field 's grass was transplanted into Notre Dame Stadium . For more than 30 years after the football team moved out , Cartier Field remained the home of Notre Dame 's baseball and track and field teams . In 1962 , the original Cartier Field was replaced by a quadrangle adjoining the Memorial Library , which opened in 1963 , and a new facility named Cartier Field was opened east of Notre Dame Stadium . Since 2008 , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team has held outdoor practices at the LaBar Football Practice Fields , and indoor practices at Meyo Field in the Loftus Center . It was named after Warren A. Cartier , an 1887 civil engineering graduate and former member of the football team who purchased 10 acres ( 40,000 m2 ) and donated it to the University for establishment of the Field . He also paid for furnishing the lumber required to enclose the Field with fencing and furnished the lumber required for a grandstand .",

A population of about 302,407 ( 2018 ) residents live within the city limits , making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S .

The city features 30 skyscrapers , two inclined railways , a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers . The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires , Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district . After the deindustrialization of the mid-20th century , Pittsburgh has transformed into a hub for the health care , education , and technology industries .",
