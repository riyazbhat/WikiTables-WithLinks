A late-ripening variety that can develop more citrus and peach notes is grown in warmer climates ( such as Alsace and parts of Austria ) . In Australia , Riesling is often noted for a characteristic lime note that tends to emerge in examples from the Clare Valley and Eden Valley in South Australia . Riesling 's naturally high acidity and pronounced fruit flavors give wines made from the grape exceptional aging potential , with well-made examples from favorable vintages often developing smokey , honey notes , and aged German Rieslings , in particular , taking on a petrol character . In 2015 , Riesling was the most grown variety in Germany with 23.0% and , and in the French region of Alsace with 21.9% and .

Brewery makes almost \u20ac2 billion worth of beer annually . The Guinness Storehouse is a tourist attraction at St. James 's Gate Brewery in Dublin , Ireland . Since opening in 2000 , it has received over 20 million visitors . Guinness 's flavour derives from malted barley and roasted unmalted barley , a relatively modern development , not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century . For many years , a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic acid flavour . Although Guinness 's palate still features a characteristic tang , the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs . The draught beer 's thick , creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen and carbon dioxide . The company moved its headquarters to London at the beginning of the Anglo-Irish Trade War in 1932 .",
