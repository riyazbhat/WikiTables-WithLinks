  "/wiki/British_Indian_Army": "The British Indian Army was the principal military of the British Indian Empire before its decommissioning in 1947 . It was responsible for the defence of both the British Indian Empire and the princely states , which could also have their own armies . The Indian Army was an important part of the British Empire 's forces , both in India and abroad , particularly during the First World War and the Second World War . The term Indian Army appears to have been first used informally , as a collective description of the Presidency armies ( the Bengal Army , the Madras Army and the Bombay Army ) of the Presidencies of British India , particularly after the Indian Rebellion . The first army officially called the Indian Army was raised by the government of India in 1895 , existing alongside the three long-established presidency armies . However , in 1903 the Indian Army absorbed these three armies . The Indian Army should not be confused with the Army of India ( 1903-1947 ) which was the Indian Army itself plus the British Army in India ( British units sent to India ) .",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)": "Lieutenant ( ; Lt ) is a junior officer rank in the British Army and Royal Marines . It ranks above second lieutenant and below captain and has a NATO ranking code of OF-1 and it is the senior subaltern rank . Unlike some armed forces which use first lieutenant , the British rank is simply lieutenant , with no ordinal attached . The rank is equivalent to that of a flying officer in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . Although formerly considered senior to a Royal Navy ( RN ) sub-lieutenant , the British Army and Royal Navy ranks of lieutenant and sub-lieutenant are now considered to be of equivalent status . The Army rank of lieutenant has always been junior to the Navy 's rank of lieutenant .",
  "/wiki/Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)": "Captain ( Capt ) is a junior officer rank of the British Army and Royal Marines and in both services it ranks above lieutenant and below major with a NATO ranking code of OF-2 . The rank is equivalent to a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and to a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force . The rank of captain in the Royal Navy is considerably more senior ( equivalent to the Army/RM rank of colonel ) and the two ranks should not be confused . In the 21st-century British Army , captains are often appointed to be second-in-command of a company or equivalent sized unit of up to 120 soldiers .",
  "/wiki/Major_(United_Kingdom)": "Major ( Maj ) is a military rank which is used by both the British Army and Royal Marines . The rank is superior to captain , and subordinate to lieutenant colonel . The insignia for a major is a crown . The equivalent rank in the Royal Navy is lieutenant commander , and squadron leader in the Royal Air Force .",
  "/wiki/Indian_Army": "The Indian Army ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat\u012bya Thal S\u0113n\u0101 ) is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces . The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army , and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff ( COAS ) , who is a four-star general . Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal , a five-star rank , which is a ceremonial position of great honour . The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company , which eventually became the British Indian Army , and the armies of the princely states , which finally became the national army after independence . The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of battles and campaigns across the world , earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence . The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity , defending the nation from external aggression and internal threats , and maintaining peace and security within its borders . It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances , like Operation Surya Hope , and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats . It is a major component of national power alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force . The army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China . Other major operations undertaken by the army include : Operation Vijay , Operation Meghdoot and Operation Cactus . Apart from conflicts , the army has conducted large peace time exercises like Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer , and it has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions including those in : Cyprus , Lebanon , Congo , Angola , Cambodia , Vietnam , Namibia , El Salvador , Liberia , Mozambique , South Sudan and Somalia . The Indian Army has a regimental system , but is operationally and geographically divided into seven commands , with the basic field formation being a division .",
  "/wiki/Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)": "Brigadier ( Brig ) is a senior rank in the British Army and the Royal Marines . Brigadier is the superior rank to colonel , but subordinate to major-general . It corresponds to the Rank of brigadier general in many other nations . The rank has a NATO rank code of OF-6 , placing it equivalent to the Royal Navy commodore and the Royal Air Force air commodore ranks and the brigadier general ( 1-star general ) rank of the United States military and numerous other NATO nations .",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_Kingdom)": "Lieutenant colonel ( Lt Col ) , is a rank in the British Army and Royal Marines which is also used in many Commonwealth countries . The rank is superior to major , and subordinate to colonel . The comparable Royal Navy rank is commander , and the comparable rank in the Royal Air Force and many Commonwealth air forces is wing commander . The rank insignia in the British Army and Royal Marines , as well as many Commonwealth countries , is a crown above a 4 pointed Bath star , also colloquially referred to as a pip . The crown has varied in the past with different monarchs ; the current one being the Crown of St Edward . Most other Commonwealth countries use the same insignia , or with the state emblem replacing the crown . In the modern British Armed forces , the established commander of a regiment or battalion is a lieutenant colonel . From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919 , the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of lieutenant colonel . It was superseded by the rank of wing commander on the following day .",
  "/wiki/Colonel": "Colonel ( /\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0rn\u0259l/ kernel ; abbreviated Col. , Col or COL ) is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks . However , in some small military forces , such as those of Monaco or the Vatican , colonel is the highest rank . It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations . Historically , in the seventeenth , eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army . Modern usage varies greatly , and in some cases , the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military service . The rank of colonel is typically above the rank of lieutenant colonel . The rank above colonel is typically called brigadier , brigade general or brigadier general . Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain . In the Commonwealth air force rank system , the equivalent rank is group captain .",
  "/wiki/Brigadier": "Brigadier /br\u026a\u0261\u0259\u02c8d\u026a\u0259r/ is a military rank , the seniority of which depends on the country . In some countries , it is a senior rank above colonel , equivalent to a brigadier general , typically commanding a brigade of several thousand soldiers . In other countries , it is a non-commissioned rank ( e.g . Spain , Italy , France , the Netherlands and the Indonesian Police ranks ) .",
  "/wiki/Major_general": "Major general ( abbreviated MG , maj. gen. and similar ) is a military rank used in many countries . It is derived from the older rank of sergeant major general . The disappearance of the sergeant in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general while a major outranks a lieutenant . In the Commonwealth and the United States , it is a division commander 's rank subordinate to the rank of lieutenant general and senior to the ranks of brigadier and brigadier general . In the Commonwealth , major general is equivalent to the navy rank of rear admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air vice-marshal . In some countries , including much of Eastern Europe , major general is the lowest of the general officer ranks , with no brigadier-grade rank .",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant-General": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use . In Latvia , Lithuania and Singapore , the chief of defence is a lieutenant general , and in the Irish Defence Forces and Israel Defense Forces , the Chief of Staff holds this rank .",
  "/wiki/General_(India)": "General is a Four Star General Officer rank in the Indian Army . It is the highest active rank in the Indian Army . General ranks above the Three Star rank of Lieutenant General and below the Five Star rank of Field Marshal , which is largely a war-time or ceremonial rank . A General may be referred to as a Full General or Four Star General to distinguish them from lower General Officer ranks like Lieutenant General and Major General . The rank is held by the Chief of the Army Staff ( COAS ) , the professional head of the Indian Army . The COAS was the only Officer to hold the rank of Full General . After the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ) , and the appointment of General Bipin Rawat as the first CDS on 1st January 2020 , there are two serving Full Generals for the first time in Independent India . The current Generals in the Indian Armed Forces are the CDS General Bipin Rawat and the COAS General Manoj Mukund Naravane . The equivalent rank in the Indian Navy is Admiral and in the Indian Air Force is Air Chief Marshal ."
