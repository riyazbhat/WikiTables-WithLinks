After Phillips and Gurland turned the festival over to programmer Ed Halter ( now an author and occasional critic for the Village Voice ) , it became noted for documentary and experimental film programming , and occasionally courted controversy , particularly in its early years . Some of these have included : premiering the North American Man/Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA ) documentary , , in 1994 ; premiering a film in 1995 that accused Quentin Tarantino of plagiarism ; being protested by Reverend Fred Phelps in 2002 ( apparently for not choosing to show a film about Phelps ) ; and premiering a theatrical version of Brad Neely 's Harry Potter parody Wizard People , Dear Reader , which eventually led to action by Warner Brothers to suppress future theatrical performances of the work . Nevertheless , though the festival has remained a small affair , and has little value as a market , its programming has attained a certain prestige , especially among younger or more experimental filmmakers . The first year showcased the work of Independent Animator Bill Plympton . The New York Times described the event as a collection of love and independence . In February 2008 the festival organizers announced that , instead of passing on the torch to a younger generation - as has been the tradition , the 15th festival would be the last . Instead two of the former organizers intend to create a new festival under the name Migrating Forms ( taking the name from a film by James Fotopoulos ) .",
