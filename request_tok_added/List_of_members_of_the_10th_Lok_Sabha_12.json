  "/wiki/Indian_National_Congress": "The Indian National Congress ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) ) ( INC , often called the Congress Party or simply Congress ) is a political party in India with widespread roots . Founded in 1885 , it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa . [ a ] From the late 19th century , and especially after 1920 , under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi , Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement . Congress led India to independence from Great Britain , [ b ] [ c ] and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire . [ d ] Congress is a big tent party whose liberal social democratic platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics . Congress ' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya-the lifting up of all sections of society-which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people . On social and economic issues , it advocates liberty , social justice , equality , welfare state , along with progressive and secular society . The party 's constitution adheres to liberal-democratic socialist philosophy . After India 's independence in 1947 , Congress formed the central government of India , and many regional state governments . Congress became India 's dominant political party ; as of 2019 , in the 17 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times , heading the central government for more than 54 years . There have been six Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947-1964 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004-2014 ) . Although it did not fare well in the last two general elections in India in 2014 and 2019 , it remains one of two major , nationwide , political parties in India , along with the right-wing , Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .",

BJP ) is one of the two major political parties in India , along with the Indian National Congress . As of 2019 [ update ] , it is the country 's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies and is the world 's largest party in terms of primary membership . BJP is a right-wing party , and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions . It has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) . The BJP 's origin lies in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh , formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mukherjee . After the State of Emergency in 1977 , the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party ; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election . After three years in power , the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP . Although initially unsuccessful , winning only two seats in the 1984 general election , it grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement . Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections , the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996 ; however , it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament , and its government lasted only 13 days . After the 1998 general election , the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year . Following fresh elections , the NDA government , again headed by Vajpayee , lasted for a full term in office ; this was the first non-Congress government to do so .",
