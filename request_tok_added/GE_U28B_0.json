  "/wiki/Burlington_Northern": "The Burlington Northern Railroad was a United States-based railroad company formed from a merger of four major U.S. railroads . Burlington Northern operated between 1970 and 1996 . Its historical lineage begins in the earliest days of railroading with the chartering in 1848 of the Chicago and Aurora Railroad , a direct ancestor line of the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad , which lends Burlington to the names of various merger-produced successors . Burlington Northern acquired the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway on December 31 , 1996 , to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway ( later renamed BNSF Railway ) , which was owned by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation . That corporation was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 2009 which is controlled by investor Warren Buffett .",

  "/wiki/Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad": "The Louisville and Nashville Railroad ( reporting mark LN ) , commonly called the L & N , was a Class I railroad that operated freight and passenger services in the southeast United States . Chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1850 , the road grew into one of the great success stories of American business . Operating under one name continuously for 132 years , it survived civil war and economic depression and several waves of social and technological change . Under Milton H. Smith , president of the company for thirty years , the L & N grew from a road with less than three hundred miles ( 480 km ) of track to a 6,000-mile ( 9,700 km ) system serving fourteen states . As one of the premier Southern railroads , the L & N extended its reach far beyond its namesake cities , stretching to St. Louis , Memphis , Atlanta , and New Orleans . The railroad was economically strong throughout its lifetime , operating both freight and passenger trains in a manner that earned it the nickname , The Old Reliable . Growth of the railroad continued until its purchase and the tumultuous rail consolidations of the 1980s which led to continual successors . By the end of 1970 , L & N operated 6,063 miles ( 9,757 km ) of road on 10,051 miles ( 16,176 km ) of track , not including the Carrollton Railroad .

By 1982 the railroad industry was consolidating quickly , and the Seaboard Coast Line absorbed the Louisville & Nashville Railroad entirely . Then in 1986 , the Seaboard System merged with the C & O and B & O and the new combined system was known as the Chessie System . Soon after the combined company became CSX Transportation ( CSX ) , which now owns and operates all of the former Louisville and Nashville lines .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Central_Railroad": "The New York Central Railroad ( reporting mark NYC ) was a railroad primarily operating in the Great Lakes and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States . The railroad primarily connected greater New York and Boston in the east with Chicago and St. Louis in the Midwest along with the intermediate cities of Albany , Buffalo , Cleveland , Cincinnati , and Detroit . New York Central was headquartered in New York City 's New York Central Building , adjacent to its largest station , Grand Central Terminal . The railroad was established in 1853 , consolidating several existing railroad companies . In 1968 the NYC merged with its former rival , the Pennsylvania Railroad , to form Penn Central . Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and merged into Conrail in 1976 . Conrail was broken up in 1998 , and portions of its system were transferred to CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway , with CSX acquiring most of the old New York Central trackage . Extensive trackage existed in the states of New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , Massachusetts and West Virginia plus additional trackage in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec .

  "/wiki/Conrail": "Conrail ( formally the Consolidated Rail Corporation , with reporting mark CR ) was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999 . The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company 's legal name , and while it no longer operates trains , it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway . The Federal Government created Conrail to take over the potentially-profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers , including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway . After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act , Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987 . The two remaining Class I railroads in the East , CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway ( NS ) , agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts ( alongside three residual shared-assets areas ) , returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central . Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board , CSX and NS took control in August 1998 , and on June 1 , 1999 , began operating their respective portions of Conrail . The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary , with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock , corresponding to how much of Conrail 's assets they acquired . Each parent , however , has an equal voting interest . The primary asset retained by Conrail is ownership of the three Shared Assets Areas in New Jersey , Philadelphia , and Detroit . Both CSX and NS have the right to serve all shippers in these areas , paying Conrail for the cost of maintaining and improving trackage . They also make use of Conrail to perform switching and terminal services within the areas , but not as a common carrier , since contracts are signed between shippers and CSX or NS . Conrail also retains various support facilities including maintenance-of-way and training , as well as a 51 percent share in the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad .",
  "/wiki/Norfolk_and_Western_Railroad": "The Norfolk and Western Railway was a US class I railroad , formed by more than 200 railroad mergers between 1838 and 1982 . It was headquartered in Roanoke , Virginia , for most of its existence . Its motto was Precision Transportation ; it had a variety of nicknames , including King Coal and British Railway of America even though the N & W had mostly articulated steam on its roster . During the Civil War , the N & W was the biggest railroad in the south and moved most of the products with their steam locomotives to help the south the best way they could . The N & W was famous for manufacturing its own steam locomotives , which were built at the Roanoke Shops , as well as its own hopper cars . In 1960 , N & W became the last major class I railroad using steam locomotives ; the last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s would not be retired until 1964 and 1965 . By 1965 , steam on class I railroads was gone but steam was n't gone on class II railroads until 1974 and class III and mining railroads did not retire their steam locomotives from their active roster until 1983 . By 1983 , steam in America on class I , II , III , and mining railroads had finally closed the chapter on America 's 150 years of steam from 1830 - 1983 . In December 1959 , the N & W merged with the Virginian Railway ( reporting mark VGN ) , a longtime rival in the Pocahontas coal region . By 1970 , other mergers with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash formed a system that operated of road on of track from North Carolina to New York and from Virginia to Iowa . In 1980 , the N & W teamed with the Southern Railway , another profitable carrier and created the Norfolk Southern Corporation holding company by merging its business operations with the business operations of the Southern Railway . The N & W and the Southern Railway continued as separate railroads now under one holding company .",
  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_and_Lake_Erie_Railroad": "The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad ( P & LE ) , also known as the Little Giant , was formed on May 11 , 1875 . Company headquarters were located in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The line connected Pittsburgh in the east with Youngstown , Ohio at nearby Haselton , Ohio in the west and Connellsville , Pennsylvania to the east . It did not reach Lake Erie ( at Ashtabula , Ohio ) until the formation of Conrail in 1976 . The P & LE was known as the Little Giant since the tonnage that it moved was out of proportion to its route mileage . While it operated around one tenth of one percent of the nation 's railroad miles , it hauled around one percent of its tonnage . This was largely because the P & LE served the steel mills of the greater Pittsburgh area , which consumed and shipped vast amounts of materials . It was a specialized railroad deriving much of its revenue from coal , coke , iron ore , limestone , and steel . The eventual closure of the steel mills led to the end of the P & LE as an independent line in 1992 . At the end of 1970 P & LE operated of road on of track , not including PC & Y and Y & S in 1970 it reported 1419 million ton-miles of revenue freight , down from 2437 million in 1944 .",
