  "/wiki/USS_Virginia_(SSN-774)": "USS Virginia ( SSN-774 ) is a nuclear powered cruise missile attack submarine and the lead ship of her class , currently serving in the United States Navy ( USN ) . She is the tenth vessel of the Navy to be named for the Commonwealth of Virginia , as well as the first US Navy attack submarine to be named after a state , a pattern that is common throughout her class . The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton , Connecticut on 30 September 1998 and her keel was laid down on 2 September 1999 . She was launched on 16 August 2003 sponsored by Lynda Johnson Robb , the wife of former Virginia governor and senator Charles Robb , and daughter of President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson . She was the first U.S. Navy submarine to be completely designed on a computer . On 10 and 11 March , the prospective submarine shot 12 dummy torpedoes into the Thames River , Connecticut , from each of the boat 's four tubes . Virginia was delivered to the Navy on 12 October 2004 , the 104th anniversary of the commissioning of Holland , the Navy 's second submarine . She was commissioned on 23 October 2004 under the command of David J. Kern . The commissioning ceremony was featured in the 2005 television series Submarine : Hidden Hunter on Discovery Channel . This class of submarine is unique in that it features a Photonics Mast Program ( PMP ) that freed ship designers to place the boat 's control room in a lower , less geometrically-constrained space than would be required by a standard , optical tube periscope . It is additionally unique in the U.S. Navy for featuring all-digital ship and ballast control systems that are manned by relatively senior watchstanders and a pressure chamber to deploy SEALs , divers or other special forces units while being submerged . On 23 November 2005 , Virginia completed her first deployment in support of the Global War on Terrorism .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion": "Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear power plant . The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship 's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor . Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers . A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built . Compared to oil or coal fuelled ships , nuclear propulsion offers the advantages of very long intervals of operation before refueling . All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor , so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel , nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes . However , the low fuel cost is offset by the high operating costs and investment in infrastructure , so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military ones .",
