  "/wiki/Madonna_of_the_Rose_(Orsanmichele)": "The Madonna of the Rose ( Italian - Madonna della Rosa ) is a 2.2 metre high marble sculpture of the Madonna and Child enthroned , with the Child trying to take a bunch of rosa canina from his mother 's hand . It forms part of a cycle of fourteen sculptures of the patron saints of the guilds of Florence on the external niches of the Orsanmichele church . No documents survive to precisely date it , leading to several theories and attributions . Most art historians attribute it to Pietro di Giovanni Tedesco , a German or Flemish sculptor active in Florence in the sculpture-yard of Florence Cathedral . It shows similarities to late works from the school of Giotto . A Latin inscription on the base of the niche records damage to the sculpture in 1493 - Mary was the protector of Florence and the person who damaged the sculpture was sentenced to death . The Madonna was commissioned by the 'Arte dei Medici e Speziali ' and completed around 1399 . An object of great popular devotion , it was moved inside the church in 1628 , meaning it is in a much better condition than the other thirteen sculptures in the cycle . It is now in the Museo di Orsanmichele , although a copy fills its original external niche , which had been used from 1858 until 1891 for Saint George by Donatello . It was restored in 1996 , revealing it had possibly originally been painted .",
