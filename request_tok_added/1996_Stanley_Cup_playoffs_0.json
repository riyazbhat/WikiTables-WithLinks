  "/wiki/Joe_Sakic": "Joseph Steven Sakic ( /\u02c8s\u00e6k\u026ak/ ; born July 7 , 1969 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player . He played his entire 21-year National Hockey League ( NHL ) career with the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche franchise . Named captain of the team in 1992 ( after serving as a co-captain in 1990-91 ) , Sakic is regarded as one of the greatest team leaders in league history and was able to consistently motivate his team to play at a winning level . Sakic led the Avalanche to Stanley Cup titles in 1996 and 2001 , being named the most valuable player of the 1996 playoffs , and honoured as the MVP of the NHL in 2001 by the hockey writers and his fellow players . He is one of six players to participate in both of the team 's Stanley Cup victories . Sakic was also named to play in 13 NHL All-Star Games and selected to the NHL First All-Star Team at centre three times . Over the course of his career , Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game , having twice scored 50 goals and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons . His wrist shot , considered one of the best in the NHL , was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared his rapid snap-shot release . At the conclusion of the 2008-09 NHL season , he was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL , as well as 14th in all-time goals and 11th in all-time assists . During the 2002 Winter Olympics , Sakic helped lead Team Canada to its first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years , and was voted as the tournament 's most valuable player . He represented the team in six other international competitions , including the 1998 and 2006 Winter Olympics . Sakic retired from the NHL on July 9 , 2009 , and had his jersey number retired prior to the Avalanche 's 2009-10 season opener on October 1 , 2009 , at Pepsi Center .",
