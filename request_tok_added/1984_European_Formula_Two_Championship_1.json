  "/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit": "Silverstone Circuit is a motor racing circuit in England located next to the Northamptonshire villages of Silverstone and Whittlebury . Silverstone is the current home of the British Grand Prix , which it first hosted in 1948 . The 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created World Championship of Drivers . The race rotated between Silverstone , Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986 , but relocated permanently to Silverstone in 1987 . The circuit also hosts the British round of the MotoGP series . On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers ' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and , if it were , would probably not occur at Silverstone . However , on 9 December an agreement was reached with Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone ensuring that the track would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 after which Donington Park would become the new host . However , the Donington Park leaseholders , Donington Ventures Leisure , ran into severe financial problems and went into administration , resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract , meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix , would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit . Although there was speculation of a street race in London , lengthy negotiations with Liberty Media have led to a new agreement for Silverstone to continue to host the British Grand Prix for a further five years after 2019 . News of the new contract was announced at a Press Conference on 10 July 2019 .
