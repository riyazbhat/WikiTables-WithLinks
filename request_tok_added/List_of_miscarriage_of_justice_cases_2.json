Following his execution , efforts were made to clear his name , but it was not until the 1990s that the key evidence was re-examined using modern forensic techniques , strongly indicating that Ross was innocent . As a result , an appeal for mercy was made to Victoria 's Chief Justice in 2006 , and on 27 May 2008 the Governor of Victoria pardoned Ross , in what is believed to be an Australian legal first .",
  "/wiki/Gun_Alley_Murder": "The Gun Alley Murder was the rape and murder of 12-year-old Alma Tirtschke in Melbourne , Australia , in 1921 . She was a schoolgirl who attended Hawthorn West High School and had last been seen alive close to a drinking establishment , the Australian Wine Saloon ; under these circumstances her murder caused a sensation . More recently , the case has become well known as a miscarriage of justice . Alma 's task that day had been to go from her grandmother 's house in Jolimont to the butchers Bennet and Woolcock Pty . Ltd. on Swanston Street , collect a parcel of meat , drop it at an aunt 's Collins Street home and return to Jolimont . It was uncharacteristic for Alma to take so long on her errands . A witness said he saw a man following Alma . Reliable witnesses who had nothing to lose or gain by telling police what they knew said Alma was dawdling , apprehensive and obviously afraid . Just a few metres away from the Australian Wine Saloon in the Eastern Arcade , between Bourke and Little Collins Streets , where Alfred Place runs off Little Collins Street ( next to present day 120 Collins St ) , Alma was last seen about 3 pm on 30 December 1921 . Her naked body was found early the next morning in a lane running east off Gun Alley , not far from Alfred Place . Following the discovery of the body , the owner of the Australian Wine Saloon , Colin Campbell Ross , was charged with her rape and murder . The case against him was based on the evidence of two witnesses , plus some strands of red hair , apparently from Tirtschke 's head , which provided a vital connection between Ross and the murder .",

It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 , and named Melbourne by Governor General Richard Bourke on 10 April 1837 in honour of the British Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne . In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 . Today , it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index . Melbourne is home to many of Australia 's best-known landmarks , such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building .

It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations .

  "/wiki/Serial_killer": "A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers . For example , while most authorities set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines serial killing as a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone . Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race . A serial killer is neither a mass murderer , nor a spree killer , although there may be conceptual overlaps between serial killers and spree killers .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Commission": "A royal commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry into a defined issue in some monarchies . They have been held in the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and Saudi Arabia . A royal commission is similar in function to a commission of inquiry ( or , less commonly , enquiry ) found in other countries such as Ireland , South Africa , and regions such as Hong Kong . It has considerable powers , generally greater even than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference of the commission . The commission is created by the head of state ( the sovereign , or their representative in the form of a governor-general or governor ) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by letters patent . In practice - unlike lesser forms of inquiry - once a commission has started the government can not stop it . Consequently , governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish . Royal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy . These can be matters such as government structure , the treatment of minorities , events of considerable public concern or economic questions . Many royal commissions last many years and , often , a different government is left to respond to the findings .",

  "/wiki/Dingo": "The dingo ( scientific name : Canis dingo , taxonomic classification : Canis familiaris , Canis familiaris dingo , Canis lupus dingo , or Canis dingo ) is a dog that is found in Australia . Its taxonomic classification is debated . It is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean , hardy body adapted for speed , agility , and stamina . The dingo 's three main coat colours are : light ginger or tan , black and tan , or creamy white . The skull , the widest part of the dingo , is wedge-shaped and large in proportion to the body . It differs from that of the domestic dog by its larger palatal width , longer rostrum , shorter skull height , and wider sagittal crest . The earliest known dingo fossil , found in Western Australia , dates to 3,450 years ago , which led to the presumption that dingoes came to Australia with seafarers prior to that time , possibly from south-west Sulawesi in modern-day Indonesia . Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years : this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period . The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog : their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today 's domestic dogs , and can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia . A recent genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 6,300 BC , followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 5,800 BC . The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named Sahul that existed until 6,500-8,000 years ago . The dingo 's habitat covers most of Australia , but they are absent in the southeast and Tasmania , a strip on the northeastern coast , and an area in the southwest ( see map ) .",

  "/wiki/Henry_Keogh": "Henry Vincent Keogh ( born 1954 ) is an Australian who was convicted of murder but was eventually released twenty years later on appeal . He grew up in Adelaide , South Australia and was educated at Saint Ignatius College and briefly at the School of Dentistry at The University of Adelaide . In 1995 , he was sentenced to 26 years in prison for the 1994 murder of his 29-year-old fianc\u00e9e , Anna-Jane Cheney , then head of Professional Conduct at the Law Society of South Australia : it was alleged that Keogh had planned the murder for over two years . Mr Keogh and his family have always claimed his innocence , and raised their doubts regarding some of the evidence upon which the conviction was based . Keogh admitted to signing five life insurance policies on behalf of Cheney . Whereas the prosecution alleged the combined value of $ 1.15 million AUD was motive for the murder , Keogh claimed that these were submitted to prevent insurance agencies he had established from lapsing , and that the amount eligible to claim was closer to $ 400,000 . The prosecution conceded during the trial that Cheney was aware of at least two of these policies . The conviction was overturned on 19 December 2014 . The third trial was set for March 2016 but a key prosecution witness fell ill. On 13 November 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) announced they had entered a nolle prosequi and would not be proceeding with a retrial at this stage .",

  "/wiki/Andrew_Mallard": "Andrew Mark Mallard ( 16 August 1962 - 18 April 2019 ) was a British-born Australian who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1995 and sentenced to life imprisonment . Almost 12 years later , after an appeal to the High Court of Australia , his conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered . However , the charges against him were dropped and Mallard was released . At the time , the Director of Public Prosecutions stated that Mallard remained the prime suspect and that if further evidence became available he could still be prosecuted . He was released from prison in 2006 after his conviction was quashed by the High Court , and paid compensation by the state government . In 2006 police conducted a review of the investigation and subsequently a cold case review . As a result , they uncovered sufficiently compelling evidence to charge convicted murderer Simon Rochford with the murder of Pamela Lawrence and to eliminate Mallard as a person of interest . After being publicly named as a suspect , Rochford was found dead in his cell at Albany Prison , having committed suicide . The Western Australian Commission on Crime and Corruption investigated whether there was misconduct by any public officer ( police , prosecutors or members of parliament ) associated with this case and made findings against two policemen and a senior prosecutor . Mallard died on 18 April 2019 in Los Angeles , the home area of his fianc\u00e9e , at about 1:30am local time , after being hit by a car .",

  "/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)": "A cardinal ( , literally cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ) is a leading bishop and prince of the College of Cardinals in the Catholic Church . Their duties include participating in Papal consistories , and Papal conclaves ( Papal elections ) , when the Holy See is vacant . Most have additional missions , such as leading a diocese or a dicastery of the Roman Curia , the equivalent of a government of the Holy See . During the sede vacante ( the period between a pope 's death or resignation and the election of his successor ) , the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals . The right to enter the Papal conclave of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs . In 1059 , the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees . In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began , with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses , while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome . The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning pivotal as in principal or chief . The term was applied in this sense as early as the 9th century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome .",
  "/wiki/Catholic_Church": "The Catholic Church , sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church , is the largest Christian church , with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017 [ update ] . As the world 's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution , it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . The Latin Church , the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders , enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church . Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . Its teaching includes Divine Mercy , sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching , which emphasises voluntary support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy .",
  "/wiki/Roman_Curia": "The Roman Curia comprises the administrative institutions of the Holy See [ note 1 ] and the central body through which the affairs of the Catholic Church are conducted . It acts in the Pope 's name and with his authority for the good and for the service of the particular churches and provides the central organization for the church to advance its objectives . [ note 2 ] The structure and organization of responsibilities within the Curia are at present regulated by the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus , issued by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988 , which Pope Francis has decided to revise . Other bodies that play an administrative or consulting role in ecclesial affairs are sometimes mistakenly identified with the Curia , such as the Synod of Bishops and regional conferences of bishops . Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller , former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , wrote in 2015 that the Synod of Bishops is not a part of the Roman Curia in the strict sense : it is the expression of the collegiality of bishops in communion with the Pope and under his direction . The Roman Curia instead aids the Pope in the exercise of his primacy over all the Churches ."
