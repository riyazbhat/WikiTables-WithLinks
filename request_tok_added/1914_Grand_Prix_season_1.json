  "/wiki/Sunbeam_Motor_Car_Company": "Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited was a British motor car manufacturer with its works at Moorfields in Blakenhall , a suburb of Wolverhampton in the county of Staffordshire , now West Midlands .

The motor business was sold to a newly incorporated Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited in 1905 to separate it from Marston 's pedal bicycle business ; Sunbeam motorcycles were not made until 1912 . In-house designer Coatalen 's enthusiasm for motor racing accumulated expertise with engines . Sunbeam manufactured their own aero engines during the First World War and 647 aircraft to the designs of other manufacturers . Engines drew Sunbeam into Grand Prix racing and participation in the achievement of world land speed records . In spite of its well-regarded cars and aero engines , by 1934 a long period of particularly slow sales had brought continuing losses . Sunbeam was unable to repay money borrowed for ten years in 1924 to fund its Grand Prix racing programme , and a receiver was appointed . There was a forced sale , and Sunbeam was picked up by the Rootes brothers . Manufacture of Sunbeam 's now old-fashioned cars did not resume under the new owners , but Sunbeam trolleybuses remained in production . Rootes had intended to sell luxury cars under the Sunbeam name , but almost four years after their purchase , in 1938 , the two brothers instead chose to add the name Sunbeam to their Talbot branded range of Rootes designs calling them Sunbeam-Talbots .",
