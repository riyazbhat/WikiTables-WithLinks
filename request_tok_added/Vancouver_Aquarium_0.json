  "/wiki/Aquarium": "An aquarium ( plural : aquariums or aquaria ) is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed . Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish , invertebrates , amphibians , aquatic reptiles such as turtles , and aquatic plants . The term aquarium , coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse , combines the Latin root aqua , meaning water , with the suffix -arium , meaning a place for relating to . The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington , who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals , so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large . The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse , who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853 , and published the first manual , The Aquarium : An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854 . An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about . Small aquariums are kept in the home by hobbyists . There are larger public aquariums in many cities . This kind of aquarium is a building with fish and other aquatic animals in large tanks . A large aquarium may have otters , turtles , dolphins , and other sea animals . Most aquarium tanks also have plants . An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium , typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic .",
  "/wiki/Sea_otters": "The sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean . Adult sea otters typically weigh between , making them the heaviest members of the weasel family , but among the smallest marine mammals . Unlike most marine mammals , the sea otter 's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur , the densest in the animal kingdom . Although it can walk on land , the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean . The sea otter inhabits nearshore environments , where it dives to the sea floor to forage . It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins , various molluscs and crustaceans , and some species of fish . Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects . First , its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools . In most of its range , it is a keystone species , controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems . Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food , leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries . Sea otters , whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000-300,000 , were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911 , and the world population fell to 1,000-2,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range . A subsequent international ban on hunting , sea otter conservation efforts , and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding , and the species occupies about two-thirds of its former range .",
  "/wiki/Endangered": "An endangered species is a species which has been categorized as very likely to become extinct in the near future . Endangered ( EN ) , as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List , is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN 's schema after Critically Endangered ( CR ) . In 2012 , the IUCN Red List featured 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered ( EN ) worldwide . The figures for 1998 were 1,102 and 1,197 respectively . Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species : for example , forbidding hunting , restricting land development or creating protected areas . Population numbers , trends and species ' conservation status can be found at the lists of organisms by population .",
  "/wiki/Steller_sea_lion": "The Steller sea lion ( Eumetopias jubatus ) , also known as the Steller 's sea lion and northern sea lion , is a near-threatened species of sea lion in the northern Pacific . It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals ( Otariidae ) . Among pinnipeds , it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two species of elephant seals . The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller , who first described them in 1741 . The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades , owing to significant and largely unexplained declines in their numbers over an extensive portion of their northern range in Alaska .",
  "/wiki/Near_threatened": "A near-threatened species is a species which has been categorized as Near Threatened ( NT ) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as that may be considered threatened with extinction in the near future , although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status . The IUCN notes the importance of re-evaluating near-threatened taxon at appropriate intervals . The rationale used for near-threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of vulnerable which are plausible or nearly met , such as reduction in numbers or range . Near-threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened , whereas prior to this conservation-dependent species were given a separate category ( Conservation Dependent ) . Additionally , the 402 conservation-dependent taxa may also be considered near-threatened .",
  "/wiki/California_sea_lion": "The California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America . It is one of six species of sea lion . Its natural habitat ranges from southeast Alaska to central Mexico , including the Gulf of California . Sea lions are sexually dimorphic ; males are larger than females , and have a thicker neck , and protruding sagittal crest . They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches , but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves . Sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid , and are preyed on by killer whales and great white sharks . California sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern . From May to August , males establish territories and try to attract females with which to mate . Females are free to move in between territories , and are not coerced by males . Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips . Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations , notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls . Outside their breeding season , sea lions spend much of their time at sea , but they come to shore to molt .",
  "/wiki/Least_concern": "A least concern species is a species that has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as evaluated as not being a focus of species conservation . They do not qualify as threatened , near threatened , or ( before 2001 ) conservation dependent . Species can not be assigned the Least Concern category unless they have had their population status evaluated . That is , adequate information is needed to make a direct , or indirect , assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution or population status . Since 2001 the category has had the abbreviation LC , following the IUCN 2001 Categories & Criteria ( version 3.1 ) . However , around 20% of least concern taxa ( 3261 of 15636 ) in the IUCN database use the code LR/lc , which indicates they have not been re-evaluated since 2000 . Before 2001 least concern was a subcategory of the Lower Risk category and assigned the code LR/lc or lc . While least concern is not considered a red listed category by the IUCN , the 2006 IUCN Red List still assigns the category to 15636 taxa . The number of animal species listed in this category totals 14033 ( which includes several undescribed species such as a frog from the genus Philautus ) . There are also 101 animal subspecies listed and 1500 plant taxa ( 1410 species , 55 subspecies , and 35 varieties ) . There are also two animal subpopulations listed : the Australasian and Southern African subpopulations of spiny dogfish . No fungi or protista have the classification , though only four species in those kingdoms have been evaluated by the IUCN .",
  "/wiki/Harbor_seal": "The harbor ( or harbour ) seal ( Phoca vitulina ) , also known as the common seal , is a true seal found along temperate and Arctic marine coastlines of the Northern Hemisphere . The most widely distributed species of pinniped ( walruses , eared seals , and true seals ) , they are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic , Pacific Oceans , Baltic and North Seas . Harbor seals are brown , silvery white , tan , or gray , with distinctive V-shaped nostrils . An adult can attain a length of 1.85 m ( 6.1 ft ) and a mass of up to . Blubber under the seal 's skin helps to maintain body temperature . Females outlive males ( 30-35 years versus 20-25 years ) . Harbor seals stick to familiar resting spots or haulout sites , generally rocky areas ( although ice , sand , and mud may also be used ) where they are protected from adverse weather conditions and predation , near a foraging area . Males may fight over mates under water and on land . Females bear a single pup after a nine-month gestation , which they care for alone . Pups can weigh up to and are able to swim and dive within hours of birth . They develop quickly on their mothers ' fat-rich milk , and are weaned after four to six weeks . The global population of harbor seals is 350,000-500,000 , but subspecies in certain habitats are threatened .",
  "/wiki/Goeldi's_marmoset": "The Goeldi 's marmoset or Goeldi 's monkey ( Callimico goeldii ) is a small , South American New World monkey that lives in the upper Amazon basin region of Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru . It is the only species classified in the genus Callimico , and the monkeys are sometimes referred to as callimicos . Goeldi 's marmosets are blackish or blackish-brown in color and the hair on their head and tail sometimes has red , white , or silverly brown highlights . Their bodies are about long , and their tails are about long . Goeldi 's marmoset was first described in 1904 , making Callimico one of the more recent monkey genera to be described . In older classification schemes it was sometimes placed in its own family Callimiconidae and sometimes , along with the marmosets and tamarins , in the subfamily Callitrichinae in the family Cebidae . More recently , Callitrichinae has been ( re- ) elevated to family status as Callitrichidae . Females reach sexual maturity at 8.5 months , males at 16.5 months . The gestation period lasts from 140 to 180 days . Unlike other New World monkeys , they have the capacity to give birth twice a year . The mother carries a single baby monkey per pregnancy , whereas most other species in the family Callitrichidae usually give birth to twins . For the first 2-3 weeks the mother acts as the primary caregiver until the father takes over most of the responsibilities except for nursing .",
  "/wiki/Vulnerable_species": "A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve . Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home . Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened . Some species listed as vulnerable may be common in captivity , an example being the military macaw . There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable , compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222 , respectively . Practices such as Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically .",
