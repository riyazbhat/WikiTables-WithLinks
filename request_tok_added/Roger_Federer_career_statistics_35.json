It was held in Perth , Australia , in early January ( sometimes commencing in late December ) each year from 1989 to 2019 . It will be replaced on the calendar in 2020 by the ATP Cup , a new ATP event , but the International Tennis Federation has said it will return in 2021 and is currently searching for a new venue . The championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman ( 1906-1985 ) , an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969 . Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989 , it has been attended each year by Hopman 's widow , his second wife Lucy , who has travelled to the tournament from her home in the United States . The tournament is a sanctioned official event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) but , while individual player results are tallied , they are not regarded as official ATP matches or included in the calculation of ATP or WTA rankings . The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series . The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and through 2013 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball designed and created by Brinkhaus Jewellers encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia . In 2014 and 2015 , the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball , using just under an ounce of 18-carat white , yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds . These trophies are valued at $ 26,000 . Until 2012 , the Hopman Cup was played at the Burswood Dome . From 2013 to 2019 , it was played at the Perth Arena .",

After two appearances as a demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984 ( with a U-21 age limit ) , it returned as a full medal sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics open for all players regardless of their age and status and has been played at every edition of the Games since then .
