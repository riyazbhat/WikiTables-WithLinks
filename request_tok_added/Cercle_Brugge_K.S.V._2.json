One stepped out of his group , went towards Pertry and hit him in the face , telling that the mockery with the Black Brigade should stop once and for all . Pertry did n't know what he had done wrong . Probably , he just had a big smile on his face while looking forward towards his first match at the highest level of Belgian football .
