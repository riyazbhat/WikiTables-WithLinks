Classified as a carboxylic acid , it is an oily , colorless liquid that is soluble in water , ethanol , and ether . Isobutyric acid ( 2-methylpropanoic acid ) is an isomer . Salts and esters of butyric acid are known as butyrates or butanoates . The acid does not occur widely in nature , but its esters are widespread . It is a common industrial chemical .",
  "/wiki/Vomiting": "Vomiting is the involuntary , forceful expulsion of the contents of one 's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose . Vomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions ; it may be present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning , or as a non-specific sequela ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation . The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea ; it often precedes , but does not always lead to vomiting . Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting . In severe cases , where dehydration develops , intravenous fluid may be required . Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia , and is itself now an eating disorder on its own , purging disorder . Vomiting is different from regurgitation , though the terms are often used interchangeably . Regurgitation is the return of undigested food back up the esophagus to the mouth , without the force and displeasure associated with vomiting . The causes of vomiting and regurgitation are generally different .",
  "/wiki/Flesh": "Flesh is the soft substance of the body of a living human or other animal . In a human or other animal body , this consists of muscle and fat ; for vertebrates , this especially includes muscle tissue ( skeletal muscle ) , as opposed to bones and viscera . Animal flesh , as food , is called meat . In plants , flesh is the tissue of the plant . In fungi , flesh is the trama that composes the internal tissue of a mushroom .",
  "/wiki/Decomposition": "Decomposition is the process by which organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter . The process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere . Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death . Animals , such as worms , also help decompose the organic materials . Organisms that do this are known as decomposers . Although no two organisms decompose in the same way , they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition . The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the Greek word taphos , meaning tomb . One can differentiate abiotic from biotic substance ( biodegradation ) . The former means degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes , e.g. , hydrolysis . The latter means the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms , typically by microorganisms .",
  "/wiki/Rancidification": "Rancidity generally is the complete or incomplete oxidation or hydrolysis of fats and oils when exposed to air , light , or moisture or by bacterial action , resulting in unpleasant taste and odor . Specifically , it is the hydrolysis or autoxidation of fats into short-chain aldehydes and ketones , which are objectionable in taste and odor . When these processes occur in food , undesirable odors and flavors can result . In certain cases , however , the flavors can be desirable ( as in aged cheeses ) . In processed meats , these flavors are collectively known as warmed-over flavor . Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food , as some vitamins are sensitive to oxidation . Similar to rancidification , oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons , such as lubricating oils , fuels , and mechanical cutting fluids .",

Depending on taxonomic viewpoint , between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere , from the Arctic , south to tropical Africa , from Ziarat , Pakistan , east to eastern Tibet in the Old World , and in the mountains of Central America . The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 16,000 ft ( 4,900 m ) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas , creating one of the highest tree-lines on earth .",
  "/wiki/Chlorine": "Chlorine is a chemical element with the symbol Cl and atomic number 17 . The second-lightest of the halogens , it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them . Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature . It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent : among the elements , it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity on the Pauling scale , behind only oxygen and fluorine . The most common compound of chlorine , sodium chloride ( common salt ) , has been known since ancient times . Around 1630 , chlorine gas was first synthesised in a chemical reaction , but not recognised as a fundamentally important substance . Carl Wilhelm Scheele wrote a description of chlorine gas in 1774 , supposing it to be an oxide of a new element . In 1809 , chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element , and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810 , who named it from based on its colour . Because of its great reactivity , all chlorine in the Earth 's crust is in the form of ionic chloride compounds , which includes table salt . It is the second-most abundant halogen ( after fluorine ) and twenty-first most abundant chemical element in Earth 's crust . These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater . Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from brine by electrolysis .",
  "/wiki/Vanilla": "Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla , primarily from the Mexican species , flat-leaved vanilla ( V. planifolia ) . The word vanilla , derived from vainilla , the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina ( vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod ) , is translated simply as little pod . Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid , called tl\u012blxochitl by the Aztecs . Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s . Pollination is required to get the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived . In 1837 , Belgian botanist Charles Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant . The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially . In 1841 , Edmond Albius , a slave who lived on the French island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean , discovered at the age of 12 that the plant could be hand-pollinated . Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant . Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally , all of which derive from a species originally found in Mesoamerica , including parts of modern-day Mexico . They are V. planifolia ( syn . V. fragrans ) , grown on Madagascar , R\u00e9union , and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean ; V. tahitensis , grown in the South Pacific ; and V. pompona , found in the West Indies , Central America , and South America .",
  "/wiki/Vanillin": "Vanillin is an organic compound with the molecular formula . It is a phenolic aldehyde . Its functional groups include aldehyde , hydroxyl , and ether . It is the primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean . Synthetic vanillin is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring agent in foods , beverages , and pharmaceuticals . Vanillin and ethylvanillin are used by the food industry ; ethylvanillin is more expensive , but has a stronger note . It differs from vanillin by having an ethoxy group ( \u2212O\u2212CHCH ) instead of a methoxy group ( \u2212O\u2212CH ) . Natural vanilla extract is a mixture of several hundred different compounds in addition to vanillin . Artificial vanilla flavoring is often a solution of pure vanillin , usually of synthetic origin . Because of the scarcity and expense of natural vanilla extract , synthetic preparation of its predominant component has long been of interest . The first commercial synthesis of vanillin began with the more readily available natural compound eugenol ( 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol ) . Today , artificial vanillin is made either from guaiacol or lignin .",
  "/wiki/Ammonia": "Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH3 . A stable binary hydride , and the simplest pnictogen hydride , ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell . It is a common nitrogenous waste , particularly among aquatic organisms , and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers . Ammonia , either directly or indirectly , is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products . It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water . Although common in nature - both terrestrially and in the outer planets of the Solar System - and in wide use , ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form . It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States , and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce , store , or use it in significant quantities . The global industrial production of ammonia in 2018 was 175 million tonnes , with no significant change relative to the 2013 global industrial production of 175 million tonnes . Industrial ammonia is sold either as ammonia liquor ( usually 28% ammonia in water ) or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders . NH3 boils at \u221233.34 \u00b0C ( \u221228.012 \u00b0F ) at a pressure of one atmosphere , so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature . Household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH3 in water . The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baum\u00e9 scale ( density ) , with 26 degrees Baum\u00e9 ( about 30% ( by weight ) ammonia at 15.5 \u00b0C or 59.9 \u00b0F ) being the typical high-concentration commercial product .",
  "/wiki/Urine": "Urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in humans and in many other animals . Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the urinary bladder . Urination results in urine being excreted from the body through the urethra . The cellular metabolism generates many by-products which are rich in nitrogen and must be cleared from the bloodstream , such as urea , uric acid , and creatinine . These by-products are expelled from the body during urination , which is the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body . A urinalysis can detect nitrogenous wastes of the mammalian body . Urine has a role in the earth 's nitrogen cycle . In balanced ecosystems urine fertilizes the soil and thus helps plants to grow . Therefore , urine can be used as a fertilizer . Some animals use it to mark their territories . Historically , aged or fermented urine ( known as lant ) was also used for gunpowder production , household cleaning , tanning of leather and dyeing of textiles . Human urine and feces are collectively referred to as human waste or human excreta , and are managed with a sanitation system .",
  "/wiki/Rose_Oil": "Rose oil ( rose otto , attar of rose , attar of roses or rose essence ) is the essential oil extracted from the petals of various types of rose . Rose ottos are extracted through steam distillation , while rose absolutes are obtained through solvent extraction , the absolute being used more commonly in perfumery . Even with their high price and the advent of organic synthesis , rose oils are still perhaps the most widely used essential oil in perfumery .",
  "/wiki/Ionone": "The ionones are a series of closely related chemical substances that are part of a group of compounds known as rose ketones , which also includes damascones and damascenones . Ionones are aroma compounds found in a variety of essential oils , including rose oil . \u03b2-Ionone is a significant contributor to the aroma of roses , despite its relatively low concentration , and is an important fragrance chemical used in perfumery . The ionones are derived from the degradation of carotenoids . The combination of \u03b1-ionone and \u03b2-ionone is characteristic of the scent of violets and used with other components in perfumery and flavouring to recreate their scent . The carotenes \u03b1-carotene , \u03b2-carotene , \u03b3-carotene , and the xanthophyll \u03b2-cryptoxanthin , can all be metabolized to \u03b2-ionone , and thus have vitamin A activity because they can be converted by plant-eating animals to retinol and retinal . Carotenoids that do not contain the \u03b2-ionone moiety can not be converted to retinol , and thus have no vitamin A activity .",
  "/wiki/Tobacco": "Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the Nicotiana genus and the Solanaceae ( nightshade ) family , and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of the tobacco plant . More than 70 species of tobacco are known , but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum . The more potent variant N. rustica is also used around the world . Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids . Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars , as well as pipes and shishas . They can also be consumed as snuff , chewing tobacco , dipping tobacco and snus . Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many diseases ; especially those affecting the heart , liver , and lungs , as well as many cancers . In 2008 , the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world 's single greatest preventable cause of death .",
  "/wiki/Cigarette": "A cigarette is a narrow cylinder containing psychoactive material , usually tobacco , that is rolled into thin paper for smoking . Most cigarettes contain a reconstituted tobacco product known as sheet , which consists of recycled [ tobacco ] stems , stalks , scraps , collected dust , and floor sweepings , to which are added glue , chemicals and fillers ; the product is then sprayed with nicotine that was extracted from the tobacco scraps , and shaped into curls . The cigarette is ignited at one end , causing it to smolder ; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end . Most modern cigarettes are filtered , although this does not make them safer . Cigarette manufacturers have described cigarettes as a drug administration system for the delivery of nicotine in acceptable and attractive form . Cigarettes are addictive ( because of nicotine ) and cause cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , heart disease , and other health problems . The term cigarette , as commonly used , refers to a tobacco cigarette but is sometimes used to refer to other substances , such as a cannabis cigarette . A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size , use of processed leaf , and paper wrapping , which is typically white . Cigar wrappers are typically composed of tobacco leaf or paper dipped in tobacco extract . Smoking rates have generally declined in the developed world , but continue to rise in some developing nations . Cigarette smoking causes disease and harms nearly every organ of the body . Nicotine is also highly addictive .",

Musk was a name originally given to a substance with a strong odor obtained from a gland of the musk deer . The substance has been used as a popular perfume fixative since ancient times and is one of the most expensive animal products in the world . The name originates from the Late Greek \u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 'moskhos ' , from Persian 'mushk ' , ultimately from Sanskrit \u092e\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915 mu\u1e63ka meaning a testicle , from a diminutive of \u092e\u0942\u0937\u094d m\u016b\u1e63 ( mouse ) . The deer gland was thought to resemble a scrotum . It is applied to various plants and animals of similar smell ( e.g . muskox ) and has come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors , despite their often differing chemical structures and molecular shapes . Natural musk was used extensively in perfumery until the late 19th century when economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of synthetic musk , which is now used almost exclusively . The organic compound primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of musk is muscone . Modern use of natural musk pods occurs in traditional Chinese medicine .",

  "/wiki/Mercaptan": "A thiol ( ) is any organosulfur compound of the form R\u2212SH , where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent . Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols ( that is , sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol ) , and the word is a portmanteau of thio- + alcohol , with the first word deriving from Greek ( theion ) meaning sulfur . The -SH functional group itself is referred to as either a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group . Many thiols have strong odors resembling that of garlic or rotten eggs . Thiols are used as odorants to assist in the detection of natural gas ( which in pure form is odorless ) , and the smell of natural gas is due to the smell of the thiol used as the odorant . Thiols are sometimes referred to as mercaptans . The term mercaptan was introduced in 1832 by William Christopher Zeise and is derived from the Latin mercurium capt\u0101ns ( capturing mercury ) because the thiolate group ( RS ) bonds very strongly with mercury compounds .",
  "/wiki/Natural_Gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the US . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",
