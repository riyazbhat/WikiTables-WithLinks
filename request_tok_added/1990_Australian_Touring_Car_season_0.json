Located on Australia 's east coast , the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km ( 43.5 mi ) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west , Hawkesbury to the north , the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west . Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs , 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions . Residents of the city are known as Sydneysiders . As of June 2017 , Sydney 's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state 's population . Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

After the merger , the Skyline and its larger counterpart , the Nissan Gloria , were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop . The Skyline was largely designed and engineered by Shinichiro Sakurai from inception , and he remained a chief influence of the car until his death in 2011 . Skylines are available in either coupe , or sedan body styles , plus station wagon , crossover , convertible and pickup/sedan delivery body styles . The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights ( as of 1972 ) . While not distributed in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G , the Skyline 's prominence in video games , movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there from 1989 to late 2005 . The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive , with four-wheel drive being available since the eighth-generation 's debut . The eleventh-generation Skyline ( V35 ) was another major turning point for the nameplate , as it dropped some of the previous generation Skyline 's trademark characteristics such as the straight-six engine ( replaced with a V6 ) and turbocharging , and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line . Nissan decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market , while its platform-mate , the 350Z , revived the Z line of pure sports cars . The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America , being sold under Nissan 's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35 in 2002 . The Skyline ( V36/J50 ) is sold in Europe , North America , South Korea , Taiwan , and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 . On April 12 , 2010 a Guinness Book of Records event took place with 225 Skylines taking part in a parade lap at the ISTS at Silverstone UK , which produced two world records : the most recorded Nissan Skylines at one meet at one time , and Most Nissan Skylines on a track at the same time .",

The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth .

The first cars named Skyline GT-R were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10 , and enjoyed legendary success in local Japanese touring car racing . This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars , under model code KPGC110 , in 1973 . After a 16-year hiatus , the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 ( R32 ) Skyline GT-R . This model GT-R proceeded to win the Japanese JTCC Group A series championship four years in a row . The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship helping the R31 Skyline GTS-R to victory in 1990 and winning alone in 1991 and 1992 , until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993 . The formidable technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to nickname the GT-R Godzilla in its July 1989 edition . Wheels then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs , most notably the R34 GT-R , Godzilla Returns was described as The best handling car we have ever driven and further ran a 12.7 quarter mile and 4.4s 0-100 also proving its strong straight-line capabilities . The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance , showcasing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS All-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering .

It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 , and named Melbourne by Governor General Richard Bourke on 10 April 1837 in honour of the British Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne . In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 . Today , it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 15th in the Global Financial Centres Index .

It is situated on a hill with the dual official names of Mount Panorama and Wahluu and is best known as the home of the Bathurst 1000 motor race held each October , and the Bathurst 12 Hour event held each February . The track is 6.213 km ( 3.861 mi ) in length , and is technically a street circuit , as it is a public road when no racing events are being run , and there are many residences which can only be accessed from the circuit . The track has an unusual design by modern standards , with a 174-metre ( 571 ft ) vertical difference between its highest and lowest points , and grades as steep as 1:6.13 . From the start-finish line , the track can be viewed in three sections ; the short pit straight and then a tight left turn into the long , steep Mountain straight ; the tight , narrow section across the top of the mountain itself ; and then the long , downhill section of Conrod Straight , with the very fast Chase and the turn back onto pit straight to complete the lap . Historically , the racetrack has been used for a wide variety of racing categories , including everything from open-wheel racers to motorcycles . However , the factors that make the track so unusual , and tighter modern safety standards , make it unlikely that major race meetings for vehicles other than closed-bodied cars will be held there again . As a public road , on non-race days and when it is not closed off during the day as part of a racing event , Mount Panorama is open to the public . Cars can drive in both directions around the circuit for no charge . However , a strict speed limit of 60 km/h ( 37 mph ) is enforced , and police regularly patrol the circuit .
