  "/wiki/Dactyl_(moon)": "Ida ( /\u02c8a\u026ad\u0259/ ; minor planet designation : 243 Ida ) is an asteroid in the Koronis family of the asteroid belt . It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology . Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid , the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt . On 28 August 1993 , Ida was visited by the uncrewed Galileo spacecraft while en route to Jupiter . It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite . Ida 's orbit lies between the planets Mars and Jupiter , like all main-belt asteroids . Its orbital period is 4.84 years , and its rotation period is 4.63 hours . Ida has an average diameter of 31.4 km ( 19.5 mi ) . It is irregularly shaped and elongated , apparently composed of two large objects connected together . Its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System , featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages . Ida 's moon Dactyl was discovered by mission member Ann Harch in images returned from Galileo . It was named after the Dactyls , creatures which inhabited Mount Ida in Greek mythology .",

  "/wiki/Linus_(moon)": "( 22 ) Kalliope I Linus is an asteroid moon that orbits the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope . It was discovered on August 29 , 2001 , by astronomers Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown with the Keck telescope , in Hawaii . Another team also detected the moon with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on September 2 , 2001 . Both telescopes are on Mauna Kea . It received the provisional designation S/2001 ( 22 ) 1 , until it was named . The naming proposal appeared in the discovery paper and was approved by the International Astronomical Union in July 2003 . Although the naming proposal referred to the mythological Linus , son of the muse Calliope and the inventor of melody and rhythm , the name was also meant to honor Linus Torvalds , inventor of the Linux operating system , and Linus van Pelt , a character in the Peanuts comic strip . With an estimated ( 17 \u00b1 1 mi ) diameter , Linus is very large compared to most asteroid moons , and would be a sizable asteroid by itself . The only known larger moons in the main belt are the smaller components of the double asteroids 617 Patroclus and 90 Antiope . It has been estimated that Linus ' orbit precesses at quite a rapid rate , making one cycle in several years . This is attributed primarily to the non-spherical shape of Kalliope . Linus 's brightness has varied appreciably between observations , which may indicate that its shape is elongated .",

  "/wiki/Remus_(moon)": "Remus is the inner and smaller moon of the main-belt asteroid 87 Sylvia . It follows an almost-circular close-to-equatorial orbit around the parent asteroid . In this respect it is similar to the other moon Romulus . Remus was discovered several years after Romulus on images taken starting on August 9 , 2004 , and announced on August 10 , 2005 . It was discovered by Franck Marchis of UC Berkeley , and Pascal Descamps , Daniel Hestroffer , and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Berthier of the Observatoire de Paris , France , using the Yepun telescope of the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) in Chile . Marchis , the project leader , was waiting for the completion of the image acquisition programme before starting to process the data . Just as he was set to go on vacation in March 2005 , Descamps sent him a brief note entitled 87 Sylvia est triple ? pointing out that he could see two moonlets on several images of Sylvia . The entire team then focused quickly on analysis of the data , wrote a paper , submitted an abstract to the August meeting in Rio de Janeiro and submitted a naming proposal to the IAU . Its full designation is ( 87 ) Sylvia II Remus ; before receiving its name , it was known as S/2004 ( 87 ) 1 . The moon is named after Remus , twin of the mythological founder of Rome , one of the children of Rhea Silvia raised by a wolf . 87 Sylvia has a low density , which indicates that it is probably a rubble pile asteroid formed when debris from a collision between its parent body and another asteroid re-accreted gravitationally .",

It is the parent body of the Sylvia family and member of Cybele group located beyond the core of the belt ( see minor-planet groups ) . Sylvia is the first asteroid known to possess more than one moon .",
  "/wiki/Romulus_(moon)": "Romulus is the outer and larger moon of the main-belt asteroid 87 Sylvia , not to be confused with the directly Sun-orbiting asteroid 10386 Romulus . It follows an almost-circular close-to-equatorial orbit around the parent asteroid . In this respect it is similar to the other moon Remus . Romulus was discovered in February 2001 from the Keck II telescope by Michael E. Brown and Jean-Luc Margot . Its full designation is ( 87 ) Sylvia I Romulus ; before receiving its name , it was known as S/2001 ( 87 ) 1 . The moon is named after Romulus , the mythological founder of Rome , one of the twins of Rhea Silvia raised by a wolf . 87 Sylvia has a low density , which indicates that it is probably a rubble pile formed when debris from a collision between its parent body and another asteroid re-accreted gravitationally . Therefore , it is likely that both Romulus and Remus , the second of Sylvia 's moons , are smaller rubble piles which accreted in orbit around the main body from debris of the same collision . In this case their albedo and density are expected to be similar to Sylvia 's . Romulus ' orbit is expected to be quite stable \u2212 it lies far inside Sylvia 's Hill sphere ( about 1/50 of Sylvia 's Hill radius ) , but also far outside the synchronous orbit . From Romulus ' surface , Sylvia takes up an angular region 16\u00b0\u00d710\u00b0 across , while Remus 's apparent size varies between 0.62\u00b0 and 0.19\u00b0 ( for comparison , Earth 's Moon has an apparent size of about 0.5\u00b0 ) .",
