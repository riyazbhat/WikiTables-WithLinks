  "/wiki/UTC": "Coordinated Universal Time ( or UTC ) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time . It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude , and is not adjusted for daylight saving time . In some countries , the term Greenwich Mean Time is used . The co-ordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 January 1960 . UTC was first officially adopted as CCIR Recommendation 374 , Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions , in 1963 , but the official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of Coordinated Universal Time ( along with the French equivalent ) were not adopted until 1967 . The system has been adjusted several times , including a brief period where time coordination radio signals broadcast both UTC and Stepped Atomic Time ( SAT ) before a new UTC was adopted in 1970 and implemented in 1972 . This change also adopted leap seconds to simplify future adjustments . This CCIR Recommendation 460 stated that ( a ) carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the SI second ; ( b ) step adjustments , when necessary , should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with Universal Time ( UT ) ; and ( c ) standard signals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT . A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds . A decision whether to remove them altogether has been deferred until 2023 . The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation ( ITU-R TF.460-6 ) , Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions , and is based on International Atomic Time ( TAI ) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of the Earth 's rotation . Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of the UT1 variant of universal time .",
  "/wiki/HTV-1": "HTV-1 , also known as the HTV Demonstration Flight or HTV Technical Demonstration Vehicle , was the first Japanese Space Agency ( JAXA ) H-II Transfer Vehicle , launched in September 2009 to resupply the International Space Station and support the JAXA Kibo ( \u304d\u307c\u3046 , Kib\u014d ? , Hope ) laboratory or JEM . It was an unmanned cargo spacecraft carrying a mixture of pressurised and unpressurised cargo to the space station . After a 52-day successful mission , HTV departed the ISS on 31 October 2009 after being released by the station 's robotic arm . The spacecraft re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on 2 November and disintegrated on re-entry as planned .",
  "/wiki/H-IIB": "H-IIB ( H2B ) is an expendable launch system used to launch H-II Transfer Vehicles ( HTV , or Kounotori ) towards the International Space Station . H-IIB rockets are liquid-fuelled with solid-fuel strap-on boosters and are launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan . Mitsubishi and JAXA have been primarily responsible for design , manufacture , and operation of H-IIB . H-IIB made its first flight in 2009 , and had made a total of eight flights through 2019 . H-IIB is able to carry a payload of up to to GTO , compared with the payload of 4,000-6,000 kg for the H-IIA , a predecessor design . Its performance to LEO is sufficient for the HTV . The first H-IIB was launched in September 2009 .",

It was launched by the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No . 2 ( H-IIB F2 ) manufactured by MHI and JAXA . After the supplies were unloaded , Kounotori 2 was loaded with waste material from ISS , including used experiment equipment and used clothes . Kounotori 2 was then unberthed and separated from the ISS and burned up upon reentering the atmosphere on 30 March 2011 .",

Kounotori 3 arrived at the ISS on 27 July 2012 , and Expedition 32 Flight Engineer and JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide used the International Space Station 's Canadarm2 robotic arm to install Kounotori 3 , to its docking port on the Earth-facing side of the Harmony module at 14:34 GMT . After the supplies are unloaded , Kounotori 3 was loaded with waste material from ISS , including used experiment equipment and used clothes .
