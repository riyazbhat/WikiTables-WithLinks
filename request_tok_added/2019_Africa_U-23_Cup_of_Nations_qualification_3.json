  "/wiki/Away_goals_rule": "The away goals rule is a method of breaking ties in association football and other sports when teams play each other twice , once at each team 's home ground . By the away goals rule , the team that has scored more goals away from home wins , if the total goals scored by each team are otherwise equal . This is sometimes expressed by saying that away goals count double in the event of a tie . The away goals rule is most often invoked in two-leg fixtures , where the initial result is determined by the aggregate score - i.e . the scores of both games are added together . In many competitions , the away goals rule is the first tie-breaker in such cases , with a penalty shootout as the second tie-breaker if each team has scored the same number of away goals . Rules vary as to whether the away goals rule applies only to the end of normal time of the second leg , or applies in extra time as well . It was first introduced by UEFA in the 1965-66 European Cup Winners ' Cup .",
