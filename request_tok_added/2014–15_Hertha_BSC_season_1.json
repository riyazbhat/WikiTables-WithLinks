  "/wiki/European_Union": "The European Union ( EU ) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe . Its members have a combined area of 4,233,255.3 km2 ( 1,634,469.0 sq mi ) and an estimated total population of about 447 million . The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters , and only those matters , where members have agreed to act as one . EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people , goods , services and capital within the internal market , enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries and regional development . For travel within the Schengen Area , passport controls have been abolished . A monetary union was established in 1999 , coming into full force in 2002 , and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency . The EU and European citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993 . The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , established , respectively , by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome . The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six : Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany . The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit . The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU , the Treaty of Lisbon , came into force in 2009 . In January 2020 , the United Kingdom became the first member state ever to leave the EU .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",
