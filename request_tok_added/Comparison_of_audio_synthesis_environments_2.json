  "/wiki/Bidule": "Bidule is a commercial software application for the creation of interactive computer music and multimedia produced by the Canadian company Plogue Arts and Technology . It runs on both Windows and Mac computers . Bidule uses a modular structure based on a patch cord metaphor much like AudioMulch , Reaktor , Pure Data , and Max/MSP . Individual modules are called bidules ( the Plogue web site states that the word Bidule is French for thingy or gadget ) . A set of bidules and connections is called a layout , and sub-patches called groups can be built within layouts and saved for use elsewhere . The program features real time audio , MIDI , Open Sound Control ( OSC ) , and spectral processing . With other audio DAW software ReWire , Bidule can run as a ReWire mixer or device . Bidule can run standalone or as a VST , VSTi or AU plugin , and can host the same . ASIO/CoreAudio is supported for low latency audio . Bidule can use multithread processing , and there is a beta build for discrete processing . Parameters can be linked to MIDI or OSC input or to other module parameters . Over one hundred modules and groups come with the software , including modules that can perform high-level math on signals .",
  "/wiki/Mac_OS_X": "macOS ( /\u02ccm\u00e6ko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ ; previously Mac OS X and later OS X ) is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001 . It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/C++": "C++ ( /\u02ccsi\u02d0\u02ccpl\u028cs\u02c8pl\u028cs/ ) is a high-level , general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language , or C with Classes . The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization . C++20 is the next planned standard , keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years .",
  "/wiki/Audio_Stream_Input/Output": "Audio Stream Input/Output ( ASIO ) is a computer sound card driver protocol for digital audio specified by Steinberg , providing a low-latency and high fidelity interface between a software application and a computer 's sound card .

  "/wiki/ReWire": "ReWire is a software protocol , jointly developed by Propellerhead and Steinberg , allowing remote control and data transfer among digital audio editing and related software . Originally appearing in the ReBirth software synthesizer in 1998 , the protocol has since evolved into an industry standard . Currently used in macOS and Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit audio applications , ReWire enables the simultaneous transfer of up to 256 audio tracks of arbitrary resolution and 4080 channels of MIDI data . This allows , for example , the output from synthesizer software to be fed directly into a linear editor without the use of intermediate files or analog transfers . There are also provisions to remotely trigger actions , such as starting and stopping recording . The protocol is licensed free of charge to companies only , but comes with a non-disclosure of source code license that is incompatible with most free-software licenses . The ReWire system consists of Hosts , Panels , and Devices . Hosts are the host applications which typically do the sequencing at one end and the final mixdown at the other end . A Device is a dynamic link library that only generates sound ; it has no user interface . A Panel is a graphical interface for setting the parameters of one Device . A typical setup would be to use Ableton Live in Host mode , and use Propellerhead Reason as a synthesizer . In this case Reason would provide Device/Panel pairs to Ableton , which could then send midi commands , sync timing and mix Reason 's output into its own effects chains .",
  "/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement": "A non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) , also known as a confidentiality agreement ( CA ) , confidential disclosure agreement ( CDA ) , proprietary information agreement ( PIA ) or secrecy agreement ( SA ) , is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material , knowledge , or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes , but wish to restrict access to or by third parties . Doctor-patient confidentiality ( physician-patient privilege ) , attorney-client privilege , priest-penitent privilege , bank-client confidentiality , and Kickback agreements are examples , often not enshrined in a written contract between the parties . It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement . An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties , typically to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets . As such , an NDA protects non-public business information . Like all contracts , they can not be enforced if the contracted activities are felonies . NDAs are commonly signed when two companies , individuals , or other entities ( such as partnerships , societies , etc . ) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other 's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship . NDAs can be mutual , meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided , or they can restrict the use of material by a single party . An employee can be required to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer , protecting trade secrets . In fact , some employment agreements include a clause restricting employees ' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information . In legal disputes resolved by settlement , the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement .",
  "/wiki/ChucK": "ChucK is a concurrent , strongly timed audio programming language for real-time synthesis , composition , and performance , which runs on Linux , Mac OS X , Microsoft Windows , and iOS . It is designed to favor readability and flexibility for the programmer over other considerations such as raw performance . It natively supports deterministic concurrency and multiple , simultaneous , dynamic control rates . Another key feature is the ability to live code ; adding , removing , and modifying code on the fly , while the program is running , without stopping or restarting . It has a highly precise timing/concurrency model , allowing for arbitrarily fine granularity . It offers composers and researchers a powerful and flexible programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis programs , and real-time interactive control . ChucK was created and chiefly designed by Ge Wang as a graduate student working with Perry R. Cook .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Command-line": "A command-line interface ( CLI ) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text . The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor . Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services . Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s , and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS , Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS , CP/M and Apple DOS . Today , users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions . However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line . Alternatives to the command line interface include text user interface menus ( for example , IBM AIX SMIT ) , keyboard shortcuts , and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer ( usually controlled with a mouse ) . Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows , DosShell , and Mouse Systems PowerPanel . Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen . Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting . Many software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation . This includes programming environments and utility programs .",
  "/wiki/Csound": "Csound is a Domain-specific computer programming language for audio programming . It is called Csound because it is written in C , as opposed to some of its predecessors . It is free software , available under the LGPL . Csound was originally written at MIT by Barry Vercoe in 1985 , based on his earlier system called Music 11 , which in its turn followed the MUSIC-N model initiated by Max Mathews at the Bell Labs . Its development continued throughout the 1990s and 2000s , led by John Fitch at the University of Bath . The first documented version 5 release is version 5.01 on March 18 , 2006 . Many developers have contributed to it , most notably Istvan Varga , Gabriel Maldonado , Robin Whittle , Richard Karpen , Michael Gogins , Matt Ingalls , Steven Yi , Richard Boulanger , and Victor Lazzarini .

By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",

  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) .

Originally specified in 1958 , Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today . Only Fortran is older , by one year . Lisp has changed since its early days , and many dialects have existed over its history . Today , the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Clojure , Common Lisp , and Scheme . Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs , influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church 's lambda calculus . It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence ( AI ) research . As one of the earliest programming languages , Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science , including tree data structures , automatic storage management , dynamic typing , conditionals , higher-order functions , recursion , the self-hosting compiler , and the read-eval-print loop . The name LISP derives from LISt Processor . Linked lists are one of Lisp 's major data structures , and Lisp source code is made of lists . Thus , Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure , giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp . The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax .",

The term can be used to describe music-generating techniques that run without ongoing human intervention , for example through the introduction of chance procedures . However through live coding and other interactive interfaces , a fully human-centric approach to algorithmic composition is possible . Some algorithms or data that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers as creative inspiration for their music .

It is one of the three main dialects of Lisp , alongside Common Lisp and Clojure . Unlike Common Lisp , Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy , specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension . Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers , Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman , via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers . It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization , giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms . It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations . It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp . The Scheme language is standardized in the official IEEE standard and a de facto standard called the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme ( RnRS ) . The most widely implemented standard is R5RS ( 1998 ) ; a new standard , R6RS , was ratified in 2007 . Scheme has a diverse user base due to its compactness and elegance , but its minimalist philosophy has also caused wide divergence between practical implementations , so much that the Scheme Steering Committee calls it the world 's most unportable programming language and a family of dialects rather than a single language .",

  "/wiki/Window_function": "In signal processing and statistics , a window function ( also known as an apodization function or tapering function ) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval , normally symmetric around the middle of the interval , usually near a maximum in the middle , and usually tapering away from the middle . Mathematically , when another function or waveform/data-sequence is multiplied by a window function , the product is also zero-valued outside the interval : all that is left is the part where they overlap , the view through the window . Equivalently , and in actual practice , the segment of data within the window is first isolated , and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values . Thus , tapering , not segmentation , is the main purpose of window functions . The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra . The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution . But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage . Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways , according to the needs of the particular application . There are many choices detailed in this article , but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice . In typical applications , the window functions used are non-negative , smooth , bell-shaped curves . Rectangle , triangle , and other functions can also be used . A rectangular window does not modify the data segment at all .",
  "/wiki/Max/MSP": "Max , also known as Max/MSP/Jitter , is a visual programming language for music and multimedia developed and maintained by San Francisco-based software company Cycling '74 . Over its more than thirty-year history , it has been used by composers , performers , software designers , researchers , and artists to create recordings , performances , and installations . The Max program is modular , with most routines existing as shared libraries . An application programming interface ( API ) allows third-party development of new routines ( named external objects ) . Thus , Max has a large user base of programmers unaffiliated with Cycling '74 who enhance the software with commercial and non-commercial extensions to the program . Because of this extensible design , which simultaneously represents both the program 's structure and its graphical user interface ( GUI ) , Max has been described as the lingua franca for developing interactive music performance software .",
  "/wiki/JavaScript": "JavaScript ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259\u02ccskr\u026apt/ ) , often abbreviated as JS , is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification . JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",

  "/wiki/IPod": "The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc . The first version was released on October 23 , 2001 , about months after the Macintosh version of iTunes was released . As of May 28 , 2019 , only the iPod Touch ( 7th generation ) remains in production . Like other digital music players , some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage devices . Prior to macOS 10.15 Apple 's iTunes software ( and other alternative software ) can be used to transfer music , photos , videos , games , contact information , e-mail settings , Web bookmarks , and calendars , to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems . Before the release of iOS 5 , the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad , a combination of the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch . As of iOS 5 , separate apps named Music and Videos are standardized across all iOS-powered products . While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media player capabilities as the iPod line , they are generally treated as separate products . During the middle of 2010 , iPhone sales overtook those of the iPod .",
  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",

  "/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)": "Haskell /\u02c8h\u00e6sk\u0259l/ is a general-purpose , statically typed , purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation . Developed to be suitable for teaching , research and industrial application , Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features . Type classes , for example , enable type-safe operator overloading , were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott for Standard ML and were first implemented in Haskell . Haskell 's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler . It is named after logician Haskell Curry . Haskell 's semantics are historically based on those of the Miranda programming language , which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group . The last formal specification of the language was made in July 2010 , while the development of GHC 's implementation has continued to extend Haskell via language extensions . The next formal specification is planned for 2020 . Haskell is used in academia and industry . As of September 2019 , Haskell was the 23rd most popular programming language in terms of Google searches for tutorials and made up less than 1% of active users on the GitHub source code repository .",
  "/wiki/Q_(equational_programming_language)": "Pure , successor to the equational language Q , is a dynamically typed , functional programming language based on term rewriting . It has facilities for user-defined operator syntax , macros , arbitrary-precision arithmetic ( multiple-precision numbers ) , and compiling to native code through the LLVM . Pure is free and open-source software distributed ( mostly ) under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later . Pure comes with an interpreter and debugger , provides automatic memory management , has powerful functional and symbolic programming abilities , and interfaces to libraries in C ( e.g. , for numerics , low-level protocols , and other such tasks ) . At the same time , Pure is a small language designed from scratch ; its interpreter is not large , and the library modules are written in Pure . The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell , but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters ( rather than off-side rule indents ) to denote program structure . The Pure language is a successor of the equational programming language Q , previously created by the same author , Albert Gr\u00e4f at the University of Mainz , Germany . Relative to Q , it offers some important new features ( such as local functions with lexical scoping , efficient vector and matrix support , and the built-in C interface ) and programs run much faster as they are compiled just-in-time to native code on the fly . Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently , but its interactive interpreter environment , the C interface and the growing set of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications , such as artificial intelligence , symbolic computation , and real-time multimedia processing . Pure plug-ins are available for the Gnumeric spreadsheet and Miller Puckette 's Pure Data graphical multimedia software , which make it possible to extend these programs with functions written in the Pure language . Interfaces are also provided as library modules to GNU Octave , OpenCV , OpenGL , the GNU Scientific Library , FAUST , SuperCollider , and liblo ( for Open Sound Control ( OSC ) ) .",

  "/wiki/FreeBSD": "FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , which was based on Research Unix . The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",
  "/wiki/Client-server": "Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service , called servers , and service requesters , called clients . Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware , but both client and server may reside in the same system . A server host runs one or more server programs , which share their resources with clients . A client does not share any of its resources , but it requests content or service from a server . Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers , which await incoming requests . Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are Email , network printing , and the World Wide Web .",
  "/wiki/LADSPA": "LADSPA is an acronym for Linux Audio Developer 's Simple Plugin API . It is an application programming interface ( API ) standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects , licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) . It was originally designed for Linux through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers Mailing List , but works on a variety of other platforms . It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plug-ins available . LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in the programming language C. There are many audio plugin standards and most major modern software synthesizers and sound editors support a variety . The best known standard is probably Steinberg Cubase 's Virtual Studio Technology . LADSPA is unusual in that it attempts to provide only the Greatest Common Divisor of other standards . This means that its scope is limited , but it is simple and plugins written using it are easy to embed in many other programs . The standard has changed little with time , so compatibility problems are rare . DSSI extends LADSPA to cover instrument plugins . LV2 is a successor , based on LADSPA and DSSI , but permitting easy extensibility , allowing custom user interfaces , MIDI messages , and custom extensions .",
  "/wiki/SynthEdit": "SynthEdit is a shareware Windows application which uses a modular VPL ( Visual Programming Language ) to create music synthesizers and effects units . These can then be compiled as VST plug-ins for use in audio applications . SynthEdit first released in 1999 by Jeff McClintock , and version 1.0 was released on 23 June 2005 . Many programmers have since created additional freeware and payware modules for use within SynthEdit 's programming environment . SynthEdit can export creations to VST format . SynthEdit allows users to create VST Instruments and VST Effects . It provides a GUI editing system and full MIDI interface for hardware controllers . SynthEdit has also been used to create additional devices that do not fall within the realms of synthesizer or effect units . Audio and MIDI plug-ins for SynthEdit can be written in C or C++ using the SynthEdit Music Plugin Standard ( SEM ) API , which is based on GMPI with some extensions .",
  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 ."
