  "/wiki/Unicode": "Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding , representation , and handling of text expressed in most of the world 's writing systems . The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium , and the most recent version , Unicode 12.1 , contains a repertoire of 137,994 characters ( consisting of 137,766 graphic characters , 163 format characters and 65 control characters ) covering 150 modern and historic scripts , as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji . The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646 , and both are code-for-code identical . The Unicode Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference , an encoding method and set of standard character encodings , a set of reference data files , and a number of related items , such as character properties , rules for normalization , decomposition , collation , rendering , and bidirectional display order ( for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts , such as Arabic and Hebrew , and left-to-right scripts ) . Unicode 's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software . The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies , including modern operating systems , XML , Java ( and other programming languages ) , and the .NET Framework . Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings . The Unicode standard defines UTF-8 , UTF-16 , and UTF-32 , and several other encodings are in use . The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8 , UTF-16 , and UCS-2 ( without full support for Unicode ) , a precursor of UTF-16 ; GB18030 is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully , while not an official Unicode standard . UTF-8 , the dominant encoding on the World Wide Web ( used in over 94% of websites ) , uses one byte for the first 128 code points , and up to 4 bytes for other characters . The first 128 Unicode code points represent the ASCII characters , which means that any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text . UCS-2 uses two bytes ( 16 bits ) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points , the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane ( BMP ) .",
  "/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system": "The Japanese addressing system is used to identify a specific location in Japan . When written in Japanese characters , addresses start with the largest geographical entity and proceed to the most specific one . When written in Latin characters , addresses follow the convention used by most Western addresses and start with the smallest geographic entity ( typically a house number ) and proceed to the largest . The Japanese system is complex and idiosyncratic , the product of the natural growth of urban areas , as opposed to the systems used in cities that are laid out as grids and divided into quadrants or districts .",
  "/wiki/Japan_Post": "Japan Post ran the world 's largest postal savings system and was often said to be the largest holder of personal savings in the world : with \u00a5224 trillion ( $ 2.1 trillion ) of household assets in its y\u016b-cho savings accounts , and \u00a5126 trillion ( $ 1.2 trillion ) of household assets in its kampo life insurance services ; its holdings accounted for 25 percent of household assets in Japan . Japan Post also held about \u00a5140 trillion ( one fifth ) of the Japanese national debt in the form of government bonds . On October 1 , 2007 , Japan Post was privatized following a fierce political debate that was settled by the general election of 2005 . Following privatization , Japan Post Holdings operate the postal business . In 2010 , privatization was put on hold . The Japanese Ministry of Finance remains the 100% shareholder . However , on October 26 , 2012 , the Japanese government unveiled plans to list shares of Japan Post Holdings within three years , partly to raise money for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Resale_price_maintenance": "Resale price maintenance ( RPM ) or , occasionally , retail price maintenance is the practice whereby a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer 's product at certain prices ( resale price maintenance ) , at or above a price floor ( minimum resale price maintenance ) or at or below a price ceiling ( maximum resale price maintenance ) . If a reseller refuses to maintain prices , either openly or covertly ( see grey market ) , the manufacturer may stop doing business with it . Resale price maintenance prevents resellers from competing too fiercely on price , especially with regard to fungible goods . Otherwise , resellers worry it could drive down profits for themselves as well as for the manufacturer . Some argue that the manufacturer may do this because it wishes to keep resellers profitable , thus keeping the manufacturer profitable . Others contend that minimum resale price maintenance , for instance , overcomes a failure in the market for distributional services by ensuring that distributors who invest in promoting the manufacturer 's product are able to recoup the additional costs of such promotion in the price that they charge consumers . Some manufacturers also defend resale price maintenance by saying it ensures fair returns , both for manufacturer and reseller and that governments do not have the right to interfere with freedom to make contracts without a very good reason .",
