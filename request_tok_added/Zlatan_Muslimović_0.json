  "/wiki/Ta'_Qali": "Ta ' Qali is a wide open space in the limits of Attard in central Malta , which contains the national football stadium , Ta ' Qali National Park , a crafts village , and a national vegetable market which is locally known as the Pitkalija . Shortly before World War II , the area was used to build a military aerodrome and a station for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , which the British called RAF Ta Kali ; Maltese place names were often corrupted in this fashion . RAF Ta Kali was operational throughout the war and continued to be used as an RAF airfield until the mid-1950s . Latterly , RAF squadrons based in the United Kingdom visited Ta Kali as part of their annual proficiency training . Since the departure of the RAF and the closure of the air base , the location has been transformed into a recreational area . The area is small in scale but considered by some in Malta as an ideal place to go for a picnic and spend weekend afternoons . The National Park also includes an amphitheatre . A number of international concerts have been staged at the park . The newly built US Embassy stands across from the Ta'Qali National Park . In July , 2011 the embassy relocated to Ta'Qali from Floriana where it stood for nearly fifty years . Ta ' Qali still fulfils part of its former role as an airfield but the only aircraft that take off from the greatly diminished landing strip are scale models , whose owners make part of a club located in Ta ' Qali . Today , many of the military huts and buildings have been converted into workshops where Maltese craftsmen produce their handiwork , and the Ta ' Qali Crafts Village has become an important tourist attraction .",

Erebuni was designed as a great administrative and religious centre , a fully royal capital . By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom , new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance . Under Iranian and Russian rule , it was the center of the Erivan Khanate from 1736 to 1828 and the Erivan Governorate from 1850 to 1917 , respectively . After World War I , Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area .

In a few decades , Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia 's principal cultural , artistic , and industrial center , as well as becoming the seat of national government . With the growth of the Armenian economy , Yerevan has undergone major transformation ."
