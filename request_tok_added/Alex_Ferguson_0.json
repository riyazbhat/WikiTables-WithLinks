  "/wiki/Doctor_of_the_University": "An honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university ( or other degree-awarding institution ) has waived the usual requirements , such as matriculation , residence , a dissertation , and the passing of comprehensive examinations . It is also known by the Latin phrases honoris causa ( for the sake of the honour ) or ad honorem ( to the honour ) . The degree is typically a doctorate or , less commonly , a master 's degree , and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution or no previous postsecondary education . An example of identifying a recipient of this award is as follows : Doctorate in Business Administration ( Hon . Causa ) . The degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor 's contributions to a specific field or to society in general . It is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one 's curriculum vitae ( CV ) as an award , and not in the education section . With regard to the use of this honorific , the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients refrain from adopting the misleading title and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate should restrict the use of the title Dr before their name to any engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community . Rev . Theodore Hesburgh held the record for most honorary degrees , having been awarded 150 during his lifetime .",
