He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each episode of his eponymous television show and named his production company and venue in Branson , Missouri , after it ; his autobiography is called Moon River and Me . Williams ' version was never released as a single , but it charted as an LP track that he recorded for Columbia on a hit album of 1962 , Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes . The song 's success was responsible for relaunching Mercer 's career as a songwriter , which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll had replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time . The song 's popularity is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people 's memories of popular songs . Comments about the lyrics have noted that they are particularly reminiscent of Mercer 's youth in the Southern United States and his longing to expand his horizons . Robert Wright wrote in The Atlantic Monthly , This is a love sung [ sic ] to wanderlust . Or a romantic song in which the romantic partner is the idea of romance ."
