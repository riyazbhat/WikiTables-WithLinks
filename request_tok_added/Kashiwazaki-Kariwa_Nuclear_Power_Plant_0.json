  "/wiki/BWR": "A boiling water reactor ( BWR ) is a type of light water nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power . It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) , which is also a type of light water nuclear reactor . The main difference between a BWR and PWR is that in a BWR , the reactor core heats water , which turns to steam and then drives a steam turbine . In a PWR , the reactor core heats water , which does not boil . This hot water then exchanges heat with a lower pressure water system , which turns to steam and drives the turbine . The BWR was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory and General Electric ( GE ) in the mid-1950s . The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy , which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor .",
  "/wiki/Advanced_boiling_water_reactor": "The advanced boiling water reactor ( ABWR ) is a Generation III boiling water reactor . The ABWR is currently offered by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy ( GEH ) and Toshiba . The ABWR generates electrical power by using steam to power a turbine connected to a generator ; the steam is boiled from water using heat generated by fission reactions within nuclear fuel . Kashiwazaki-Kariwa unit 6 is considered the first Generation III reactor in the world . Boiling water reactors ( BWRs ) are the second most common form of light water reactor with a direct cycle design that uses fewer large steam supply components than the pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) , which employs an indirect cycle . The ABWR is the present state of the art in boiling water reactors , and is the first Generation III reactor design to be fully built , with several reactors complete and operating . The first reactors were built on time and under budget in Japan , with others under construction there and in Taiwan . ABWRs were on order in the United States , including two reactors at the South Texas Project site ( although the project is currently halted ) . The projects in both Taiwan and US are both reported over-budgeted . The standard ABWR plant design has a net electrical output of about , generated from about of thermal power .",
  "/wiki/Toshiba": "Toshiba Corporation ( \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u6771\u829d , Kabushiki-gaisha T\u014dshiba , English : /t\u0259\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0b\u0259 , t\u0252- , to\u028a-/ ) is a Japanese multinational conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo , Japan . Its diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems , electronic components and materials , power systems , industrial and social infrastructure systems , consumer electronics , home appliances , medical equipment , office equipment , as well as lighting and logistics . Toshiba was founded in 1939 as Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K . through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho ( founded in 1875 ) and Tokyo Denki ( founded in 1890 ) . The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978 . It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange , where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices , the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Nagoya Stock Exchange . Toshiba is the ninth largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world . In 2017 , Toshiba filed unaudited quarterly results because of uncertainties at Westinghouse , which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Toshiba stated that substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern exists . Toshiba is organized into four groupings : the Digital Products Group , the Electronic Devices Group , the Home Appliances Group and the Social Infrastructure Group . Midea Group , a Chinese company , bought a controlling 80.1% stake in the Toshiba Home Appliances Group in 2016 .",
