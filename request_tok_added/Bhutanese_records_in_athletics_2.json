It is situated in the western central part of Bhutan , and the surrounding valley is one of Bhutan 's dzongkhags , the Thimphu District . The ancient capital city of Punakha was replaced as capital by Thimphu in 1955 , and in 1961 Thimphu was declared as the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan by the 3rd Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck . The city extends in a north-south direction on the west bank of the valley formed by the Raid\u0101k River , which is known as the Wang Chuu or Thimphu Chuu in Bhutan . Thimphu is the fifth highest capital in the world by altitude and ranges in altitude from 2,248 metres ( 7,375 feet ) to 2,648 metres ( 8,688 feet ) . Unusually for a capital city , Thimphu does not have its own airport , but relies on the Paro Airport connected by road some 54 kilometres ( 34 miles ) away . Thimphu , as the political and economic center of Bhutan , has a dominant agricultural and livestock base , which contributes 45% of the country 's GNP . Tourism , though a contributor to the economy , is strictly regulated , maintaining a balance between the traditional , development and modernization . Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan , including the National Assembly of the newly-formed parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace , the official residence of the King , located to the north of the city . Thimphu is co-ordinated by the Thimphu Structure Plan , an Urban Development Plan which evolved in 1998 with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley . This development is ongoing with financial assistance from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank . The culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in Thimphu in literature , religion , customs , and national dress code , the monastic practices of the monasteries , music , and dance , and in the media .",
  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",
  "/wiki/400_metres": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion . Steven Gardiner is the reigning World Champion .",

The town occupies parts of both Phuentsholing Gewog and Sampheling Gewog . Phuentsholing adjoins the Indian town of Jaigaon , and cross-border trade has resulted in a thriving local economy . The town has the headquarters of the Bank of Bhutan previously but shifted to Thimphu . In 2017 , Phuentsholing had a population of 27,658 .",
  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",
  "/wiki/1500_metres": "The 1500 metres or 1,500-metre run ( typically pronounced 'fifteen-hundred metres ' ) is the foremost middle distance track event in athletics . The distance has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 and the World Championships in Athletics since 1983 . It is equivalent to 1.5 kilometers or approximately \u200b15\u204416 miles . The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race . The women 's 1,500-metre race was first added to the Summer Olympics in 1972 , and the winner of the first gold medal was Lyudmila Bragina of the Soviet Union . During the Olympic Games of 1972 through 2008 , the women 's 1,500-metre race has been won by three Soviets plus one Russian , one Italian , one Romanian , one Briton , one Kenyan , and two Algerians .",
  "/wiki/3000_metres": "The 3000 metres or 3000-metre run is a track running event , also commonly known as the 3K or 3K run , where 7.5 laps are completed around an outdoor 400 m track or 15 laps around a 200 m indoor track . It is debated whether the 3000m should be classified as a middle distance or long distance event . In elite level competition , 3000 m pace is more comparable to the pace found in the longer 5000 metres event , rather than mile pace . The world record performance for 3000 m equates to a pace of 58.76 seconds per 400 m , which is closer to the 60.58 seconds for 5000 m than the 55.46 seconds for the mile . However , the 3000 m does require some anaerobic conditioning and an elite athlete needs to develop a high tolerance to lactic acid , as does the mile runner . Thus , the 3000 m demands a balance of aerobic endurance needed for the 5000 m and lactic acid tolerance needed for the Mile . In men 's athletics , 3000 metres has been an Olympic discipline only as a team race at the 1912 , 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics . It has not been contested at any of the IAAF outdoor championships , but is occasionally hosted at annual elite track and field meetings . It is often featured in indoor track and field programmes and is the longest distance event present at the IAAF World Indoor Championships . In women 's athletics , 3000 metres was a standard event in the Olympic Games ( 1984 to 1992 ) and World Championships ( 1980 to 1993 ) . The event was discontinued at World Championship and Olympic level after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics - Qu Yunxia being the final gold medal winner at the event . Starting with the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and the 1996 Olympic Games , it was replaced by 5000 metres , with other IAAF-organized championships following suit .",
  "/wiki/5K_run": "The 5K run is a long-distance road running competition over a distance of . Also referred to as the 5K road race , 5 km , or simply 5K , it is the shortest of the most common road running distances . It is usually distinguished from the 5000 metres track running event by stating the distance in kilometres , rather than metres . Among road running events , the 5K distance is mostly popular with novice or infrequent runners or joggers , as it is comparatively easier to complete the distance without endurance training . This also makes the distance suitable for people looking to improve or maintain their general physical fitness , rather than develop long-distance running abilities . The brevity of the distance means that less time is required to take part in the activity and that people from a wide range of ages and abilities may participate . From a physiological perspective , five kilometres is towards the low end of endurance running . The combination of the activity 's simplicity , its low cost , and medium exercise intensity mean that it is often recommended by medical organisations and healthcare professionals . Like all physical activity , regular 5K runs can improve cardiovascular function and reduce body fat , as well as having mental health benefits ( see runner 's high ) .",

Also referred to as the 10K road race , 10 km , or simply 10K , it is one of the most common types of road running event , alongside the shorter 5K and longer half marathon and marathon . It is usually distinguished from the 10,000 metres track running event by stating the distance in kilometres , rather than metres . As one of the shortest common road distances , many 10K races attract high levels of public participation . Among the largest 10K races , the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta , United States had over 55,000 participants in 2011 while the Vancouver Sun Run and Bolder Boulder both had close to 50,000 runners . The popularity of 10K races lies in the fact that , for most adults , the 10K distance is long enough to represent a challenge but short enough to remain accessible for an untrained runner . Most popular 10K races are an annual fixture in a city or area and typically incorporate an element of charity running , where participants raise funds for a cause based upon their completion of the course . Members of the public may take part in the races as a competition or simply for pleasure as a fun run . Some races also allow wheelchair racers to enter . Traditional New Year 's Day races in Europe ( Silvesterlauf ) are often held over 10K . The accessibility of the distance , and road running in general , has meant that local governments and health charities often form partnerships with races as a way of promoting physical fitness among the general public .
