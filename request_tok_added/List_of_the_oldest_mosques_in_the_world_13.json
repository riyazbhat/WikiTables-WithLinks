Built in AD 537 in the Middle Ages , it was famous in particular for its massive dome . It was the world 's largest building and an engineering marvel of its time . It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have changed the history of architecture . The Hagia Sophia construction consists of mostly masonry . The structure is composed of brick and mortar joints that are 1.5 times the width of the bricks . The mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces displaced very evenly throughout the mortar joints . This combination of sand and ceramic pieces could be considered to be the equivalent of modern concrete at the time . From the date of its construction 's completion in 537 until 1453 , it served as an Eastern Orthodox cathedral and the seat of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople , except between 1204 and 1261 , when it was converted by the Fourth Crusaders to a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire . The building was later converted into an Ottoman mosque from 29 May 1453 until 1931 . It was then secularized and opened as a museum on 1 February 1935 . It remained the world 's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years , until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520 .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",

He is an important figure in Islam as he was a member of the Household of Muhammad ( Ahl al-Bayt ) and the People of the Cloak ( Ahl al-Kis\u0101 ' ) , as well as the third Shia Imam . Prior to his death , the Umayyad ruler Mu'awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor , contrary to the Hasan-Muawiya treaty . When Muawiya died in 680 CE , Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him . Husayn refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid , even though it meant sacrificing his life . As a consequence , he left Medina , his hometown , to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60 . There , the people of Kufa sent letters to him , asking his help and pledging their allegiance to him . So he traveled towards Kufa , after getting some favorable indications along with a small caravan of his relatives and followers but near Karbala his caravan was intercepted by Yazid 's army . He was killed and beheaded in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 ( 10 Muharram 61 AH ) by Yazid , along with most of his family and companions , including Husayn 's six month old son , Ali al-Asghar , with the women and children taken as prisoners . Anger at Husayn 's death was turned into a rallying cry that helped undermine the Umayyad caliphate 's legitimacy , and ultimately its overthrow by the Abbasid Revolution . The annual commemoration of Husayn and his children , family and companions occurs during Muharram , the first month of the Islamic calendar , and the day he was martyred is known as Ashura ( the tenth day of Muharram , a day of mourning for Shi ' i Muslims ) .

Born in Ta'if , Mukhtar moved to Iraq at a young age and grew up in Kufa . Following the death of Husayn ibn Ali , a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , at the hands of the Umayyad army in the Battle of Karbala in 680 , he allied with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca , but the alliance was short-lived . Mukhtar returned to Kufa where he declared Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah , a son of caliph Ali ( r. 656-661 ) and brother of Husayn , the mahdi and the imam , and called for the establishment of an Alid caliphate and retaliation for Husayn 's killing . He took over Kufa in October 685 , after expelling its Zubayrid governor , and later ordered the execution of those involved in the killing of Husayn . Hostile relations with Ibn al-Zubayr ultimately led to Mukhtar 's death by the forces of the Zubayrid governor of Basra , Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr , following a four-month siege . Although Mukhtar was defeated , his movement would have far-reaching consequences . After his death , his followers formed a radical Shi ' a sect , later known as the Kaysanites , who developed several novel doctrines and influenced later Shi ' a ideology . Mukhtar raised the social status of mawali ( local converts to Islam ) and they became an important political entity . The mawali and Kaysanites went on to play a significant role in the Abbasid Revolution sixty years later . Mukhtar is a controversial figure among Muslims ; condemned by many as a false prophet , but revered by Shi ' a because of his support for the Alids .

When al-Ma'mun died unexpectedly on campaign in August 833 , al-Mu'tasim was thus well placed to succeed him , overriding the claims of al-Ma'mun 's son al-Abbas . Al-Mu'tasim continued many of his brother 's policies , such as the partnership with the Tahirids , who ruled Khurasan and Baghdad on behalf of the Abbasids . With the support of the powerful chief q\u0101d\u012b , Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad , he continued to implement the rationalist Islamic doctrine of Mu'tazilism and the persecution of its opponents through the inquisition ( mi\u1e25na ) . Although not personally interested in literary pursuits , al-Mu'tasim also nurtured the scientific renaissance begun under al-Ma'mun . In other ways , his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in Islamic history , with the creation of a new regime centred on the military , and particularly his Turkish guard . In 836 , a new capital was established at Samarra to symbolize this new regime and remove it from the restive populace of Baghdad . The power of the caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced the power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in Samarra , and the fiscal apparatus of the state was more and more dedicated to the maintenance of the professional army , which was dominated by Turks . The Arab and Iranian elites that had played a major role in the early period of the Abbasid state were increasingly marginalized , and an abortive conspiracy against al-Mu'tasim in favour of al-Abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks . This strengthened the position of the Turks and their principal leaders , Ashinas , Wasif , Itakh , and Bugha .",
