  "/wiki/Boston_Minutemen": "The Boston Minutemen were a soccer team based out of Boston that played in the NASL . They played from 1974 to 1976 . Their home fields included Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill , Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough , Veterans Memorial Stadium in Quincy and Sargent Field in New Bedford . Portuguese legend Eus\u00e9bio played for the Minutemen in 1975 as did famed American player Shep Messing . The Minutemen started well , winning the Northern Division title in their first season and drawing over 9000 fans a match to Alumni Stadium , good for 5th highest in the league . They lost in the playoffs to eventual league champion Los Angeles Aztecs . When Eusebio came to Boston in 1975 ( by which time the team had relocated to Nickerson Field ) it seemed as though things would continue to look up . Though the team would win the Northern Division title again for the second time in as many seasons , attendance curiously fell to around 4000 - half of what it had been . In the playoffs the Minutemen lost to Miami in extra time . For the 1976 season , team owner John Sterge announced the Minutemen would relocate again , this time to Harvard Stadium , but that deal collapsed before the start of the season and the team ended up playing in a hodge-podge of grounds : Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough , Veteran 's Memorial Stadium in Quincy , and Sargent Field in New Bedford . By this time Sterge was having financial difficulties ( which ended in action by the Securities and Exchange Commission ) and was compelled to sell off many of his players , including Eusebio , who went to the eventual champions Toronto Metros-Croatia . Attendance plummeted , the Minutemen lost their last 12 matches , and after the season they folded .",
