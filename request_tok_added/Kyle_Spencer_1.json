Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head , the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate . With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels , a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum , Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets . It has a growing population , a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries . Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town , there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age . The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner , William Cavendish , later to become the Duke of Devonshire . Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town , but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration . The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne . As a seaside resort Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism , with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences , public events and cultural sightseeing . The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail , healthcare , education , construction , manufacturing , professional scientific and the technical sector . Eastbourne 's population is growing ; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412 . The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students , families and those commuting to London and Brighton .",

The event , which was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit from 1976-1989 , features a 32-player singles draw and a doubles tournament . Each year that the tournament has been held there is an induction ceremony for the Hall of Fame . The tournament is held on outdoor grass courts , and is the last grass court tournament of the season on the ATP tour and the only grass court tournament played outside Europe , as well as the only one played after Wimbledon . Up until 2011 , when John Isner won the tournament , the top seed had never triumphed at Newport , a trait that has led to the moniker the Casino Curse , due to the location of the Hall of Fame at the Newport Casino . It is hosted in the week directly after Wimbledon . As such the tournament tends to get few top players competing in it ; for example in 2008 its top two seeds were Mardy Fish and Fabrice Santoro , who going into the tournament had world rankings of 41 and 57 , while 8th seed Kevin Anderson was ranked outside the top 100 , at 115 . Arguably its four most famous champions are former World No . 1 Lleyton Hewitt , former World No . 4 Greg Rusedski , former two-time Grand Slam runner-up Mark Philippoussis , and two-time Australian Open winner Johan Kriek .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
