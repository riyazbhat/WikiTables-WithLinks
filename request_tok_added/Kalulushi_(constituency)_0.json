  "/wiki/Zambian_general_election,_1968": "General elections were held in Zambia on 19 December 1968 to elect the National Assembly and President . The first post-independence polls saw incumbent Kenneth Kaunda retain his post as president , whilst his United National Independence Party , the only party to field candidates in all 105 constituencies , won 81 of the 105 seats in the National Assembly . Voter turnout was 82.5% in the parliamentary election , but 87.1% in the presidential election . The only other contestants in the National Assembly elections were the Zambian African National Congress ( 73 candidates ) , and three independents . The United Party , which had been established in 1966 , was banned in 1968 , with many of its members absorbed by the ZANC . The election campaign was marred by violence , with UNIP members in Northern and Luapula Provinces blocking ZANC candidates from lodging nomination papers , resulting in 30 UNIP candidates running unopposed . Nevertheless , the election saw a swing towards the ZANC ; four ministers lost their seats . In 1972 , the Kaunda government announced its intention to make UNIP the only legally permitted party in the country . This was formalised with a new constitution that was promulgated in August 1973 . As a result , the 1968 elections were the last multiparty elections held in Zambia until 1991 .",

They were boycotted by the main opposition party , the United National Independence Party , together with five other allied parties , following changes to the constitution which they failed to have reversed following a court challenge . The changes imposed a two-term limit on the presidency , required presidential candidates to be born to two Zambian citizens by birth or descent , and required National Assembly candidates to give up their chieftaincy . UNIP believed these changes were specifically aimed at their longtime leader , Kenneth Kaunda , whose parents were Malawian and had previously served as the country 's first president from 1964 to 1991 . The changes would have also excluded UNIP 's vice president , a chief . Subsequently , the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy won a comfortable victory in both elections , taking 131 of the 150 elected seats in the National Assembly , and its candidate , Frederick Chiluba , winning 73% of the vote in the presidential election .

Both domestic and international election monitors cited serious irregularities with the campaign and election , including vote rigging , flawed voter registration , unequal and biased media coverage , and the MMD 's improper use of state resources . In January 2002 , three opposition candidates petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn Mwanawasa 's victory .
