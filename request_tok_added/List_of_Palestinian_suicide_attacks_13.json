Particularly Hassan Nasrallah , for their stance and support , be it financial , military or moral support . Following the Israeli and Egyptian squeeze on Hamas in early 2014 , PIJ has seen its power steadily increase with the backing of funds from Iran .

The Karni Crossing is managed by the Israel Airports Authority , unlike the Erez Crossing , which is managed by the Israel Defense Forces . When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007 , Israel closed the terminal . The crossing has been affected by the Israeli Blockade of the Gaza Strip . At the end of March 2011 Israel permanently shut the Karni Crossing . According to the management , the crossing is named after Joseph Karni , an Israeli who had set up a modern packing warehouse in the Gaza Strip near the present-day cargo terminal shortly after Israel captured the strip in 1967 .

Israel , the United States and the European Union classify , either in whole or in part , Hamas as a terrorist organization . This classification is one among various and diverse international positions on the nature of Hamas . Russia , China , and Turkey are some countries who view Hamas in a positive light . Hamas was founded in 1987 , soon after the First Intifada broke out , as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood , which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel , refrained from resistance , and was hostile to the PLO . Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987 , and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988 , that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine , including modern-day Israel , from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948 , including their descendants , to return to what is now Israel , although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict .
