  "/wiki/My_Own_Private_Idaho": "My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant , loosely based on Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part 1 , Henry IV , Part 2 , and Henry V , and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves . The story follows two friends , Mike and Scott , as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland , Oregon to Mike 's hometown in Idaho , and then to Rome in search of Mike 's mother . Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s , but discarded it after reading John Rechy 's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy 's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own . Over the years , Van Sant rewrote the script , which comprised two stories : that of Mike and the search for his mother , and Scott 's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays . Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing , and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids . After he sent copies of his script to Reeves , and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix , both agreed to star in the film on each other 's behalf . My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival , and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly . The film was a moderate financial success , grossing over $ 6.4 million in North America , above its estimated budget of $ 2.5 million . Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film , including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival , Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards , and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics . My Own Private Idaho is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement , an early 1990s movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking . Since its 1991 release , the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic , especially among LGBT audiences . The film is notable for its then-taboo subject matter and avant-garde style ."
