Several years later Kubica spoke during an interview on a F1 official podcast 'Beyond The Grid ' and confirmed he had signed a pre-contract for the 2012 season with Ferrari , a move that was eventually cancelled by his devastating rally crash in the winter of 2011 . On 6 February 2011 , Kubica was seriously injured in a crash at the Ronde di Andora rally , in which his right forearm was partially severed . He was taking part in the rally for personal enjoyment . Kubica told Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport in a bedside interview that he could feel the fingers in his right hand and was determined to make a swift return to Formula One in 2011 . Since his return to good health , however , he initially stated that a return to Formula One would be nearly impossible because of his injury . Since then , he has taken part in tests with Renault and Williams , admitting that a Formula One return in the near future was not impossible .",

  "/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit": "Silverstone Circuit is a motor racing circuit in England located next to the Northamptonshire villages of Silverstone and Whittlebury . Silverstone is the current home of the British Grand Prix , which it first hosted in 1948 . The 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created World Championship of Drivers . The race rotated between Silverstone , Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986 , but relocated permanently to Silverstone in 1987 . The circuit also hosts the British round of the MotoGP series . On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers ' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and , if it were , would probably not occur at Silverstone . However , on 9 December an agreement was reached with Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone ensuring that the track would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 after which Donington Park would become the new host . However , the Donington Park leaseholders , Donington Ventures Leisure , ran into severe financial problems and went into administration , resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract , meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix , would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit . Although there was speculation of a street race in London , lengthy negotiations with Liberty Media have led to a new agreement for Silverstone to continue to host the British Grand Prix for a further five years after 2019 . News of the new contract was announced at a Press Conference on 10 July 2019 .

  "/wiki/Circuito_del_Jarama": "The Circuito del Jarama ( Circuit of Jarama ) , formerly known as Circuito Permanente del Jarama ( Permanent circuit of Jarama ) is a motorsport racetrack located in San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes , north of Madrid . It was home to the Spanish Grand Prix nine times between 1968 and 1981 , and the Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix 15 times between 1969 and 1988 . Designed by John Hugenholtz ( who also created Suzuka ) , the circuit was built by Alessandro Rocci in 1967 on scrub land . It has a short main straight and most of the course consisted of tight , twisty corners so overtaking was extremely difficult . An example of this came when Gilles Villeneuve successfully defended his lead throughout the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix , despite a tail of four potentially faster cars . Villeneuve 's turbocharged Ferrari 126CK , while powerful and fast on the straight , did not have as efficient ground effect aerodynamics as his pursuers - Jacques Laffite ( V12 Ligier-Matra ) , John Watson ( McLaren-Ford ) , Carlos Reutemann ( Williams-Ford ) , and Elio de Angelis ( Lotus-Ford ) and was slower through the turns . This victory was to be the last one of Villeneuve 's career . Jarama hosted its last Formula One race in 1981 when it was deemed too narrow for modern racing . It still holds sports car , touring car and motorcycle races . The circuit was lengthened in 1991 , and then upgraded in 2015 . In 1987 , Jarama hosted Round 2 of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship for Group A cars , the 1987 Jarama 4 Hours . The race was won by Roberto Ravaglia and Emanuele Pirro driving a Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M3 .",

Originally part of the Donington Hall estate , it was created as a racing circuit during the period between the First and Second World Wars when the German Silver Arrows were battling for the European Championship . Used as a military vehicle storage depot during the Second World War , it fell into disrepair until bought by local construction entrepreneur Tom Wheatcroft .

Leased by Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd in 2007 the hope that Formula One racing could return to the track , the incomplete venture failed to raise sufficient financial backing during the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis . DVLL consequently lost the rights to the British rounds of both Formula 1 and MotoGP , and in its bankruptcy returned the track to the Wheatcroft family in December 2009 .
