  "/wiki/Lock_(rugby_union)": "In the game of rugby union , there are 15 players on each team , comprising eight forwards ( wearing jerseys numbered 1-8 ) and seven backs ( numbered 9-15 ) . In addition , there may be up to eight replacement players on the bench , numbered 16-23 . Players are not restricted to a single position , although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types . Players that play multiple positions are called utility players . Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs . Props push in the scrums , while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by hooking it back with their heel . The hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs , where it is mostly competed for by the locks , who are generally the tallest players on the team . The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team . The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster . Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking . Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers , and have the ability to catch a kicked ball . The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries .",
