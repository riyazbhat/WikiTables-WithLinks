  "/wiki/Geological_unit": "A stratigraphic unit is a volume of rock of identifiable origin and relative age range that is defined by the distinctive and dominant , easily mapped and recognizable petrographic , lithologic or paleontologic features ( facies ) that characterize it . Units must be mappable and distinct from one another , but the contact need not be particularly distinct . For instance , a unit may be defined by terms such as when the sandstone component exceeds 75% .",
  "/wiki/Lithology": "The lithology of a rock unit is a description of its physical characteristics visible at outcrop , in hand or core samples , or with low magnification microscopy . Physical characteristics include colour , texture , grain size , and composition . Lithology may refer to either a detailed description of these characteristics , or a summary of the gross physical character of a rock . Lithology is the basis of subdividing rock sequences into individual lithostratigraphic units for the purposes of mapping and correlation between areas . In certain applications , such as site investigations , lithology is described using a standard terminology such as in the European geotechnical standard Eurocode 7 .",
  "/wiki/Roosville_Formation": "The Purcell Supergroup is composed primarily of argillites , carbonate rocks , quartzites , and mafic igneous rocks of late Precambrian ( Mesoproterozoic ) age . It is present in an area of about 15,000 km ( 5,800 sq . mi . ) in southwestern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia , Canada , and it extends into the northwestern United States where it is called the Belt Supergroup . It was named for the Purcell Mountains of British Columbia by R.A. Daly in 1912 . Fossil stromatolites and algal structures are common in some of the Purcell Supergroup rocks , and the Sullivan ore body at Kimberley , British Columbia , a world-class deposit of lead , zinc , and silver , lies within the Alderidge Formation in the lower part of the Purcell . Spectacular outcrops of Purcell and Belt Supergroup rocks can be seen in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana and Waterton Lakes National Park in southwestern Alberta .",
  "/wiki/Dolomite_(mineral)": "Dolomite ( ) is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate , ideally The term is also used for a sedimentary carbonate rock composed mostly of the mineral dolomite . An alternative name sometimes used for the dolomitic rock type is dolostone .",
  "/wiki/Siltstone": "Siltstone is a sedimentary rock which has a grain size in the silt range , finer than sandstone and coarser than claystones .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Argillaceous_minerals": "Argillaceous minerals are minerals containing substantial amounts of clay-like components ( = clay ) . Argillaceous components are fine-grained ( less than 2 \u03bcm ) aluminosilicates , and more particularly clay minerals such as kaolinite , montmorillonite-smectite , illite , and chlorite . Claystone and shales are thus predominantly argillaceous . Argillaceous minerals may appear silvery upon optical reflection . The adjective argillaceous is also used to define rocks in which clay minerals are a secondary but significant component . For example , argillaceous limestones are limestones consisting predominantly of calcium carbonate , but including 10-40% of clay minerals : such limestones , when soft , are often called marls . Similarly , argillaceous sandstones are sandstones consisting primarily of quartz grains , with the interstitial spaces filled with clay minerals .",
  "/wiki/Stromatolite": "Stromatolites ( ) or stromatoliths ( from Greek str\u014dma layer , stratum ( str\u014dmatos ) , and lithos rock ) are layered mounds , columns , and sheet-like sedimentary rocks that were originally formed by the growth of layer upon layer of cyanobacteria , a single-celled photosynthesizing microbe . Fossilized stromatolites provide records of ancient life on Earth . Lichen stromatolites are a proposed mechanism of formation of some kinds of layered rock structure that are formed above water , where rock meets air , by repeated colonization of the rock by endolithic lichens .",
  "/wiki/Mudcrack": "Mudcracks ( also known as desiccation cracks , mud cracks or cracked mud ) are sedimentary structures formed as muddy sediment dries and contracts . Crack formation also occurs in clay-bearing soils as a result of a reduction in water content .",

  "/wiki/Quartz": "Quartz is a hard , crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms . The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra , giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2 . Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth 's continental crust , behind feldspar . Quartz exists in two forms , the normal \u03b1-quartz and the high-temperature \u03b2-quartz , both of which are chiral . The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 \u00b0C ( 846 K ; 1,063 \u00b0F ) . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume , it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold . There are many different varieties of quartz , several of which are semi-precious gemstones . Since antiquity , varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings , especially in Eurasia .",
  "/wiki/Conglomerate_(geology)": "Conglomerate ( ) is a coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of a substantial fraction of rounded to subangular gravel-size clasts , e.g. , granules , pebbles , cobbles , and boulders , larger than in diameter . Conglomerates form by the consolidation and lithification of gravel . Conglomerates typically contain finer grained sediment , e.g. , either sand , silt , clay or combination of them , called matrix by geologists , filling their interstices and are often cemented by calcium carbonate , iron oxide , silica , or hardened clay . The size and composition of the gravel-size fraction of a conglomerate may or may not vary in composition , sorting , and size . In some conglomerates , the gravel-size class consist almost entirely of what were clay clasts at the time of deposition . Conglomerates can be found in sedimentary rock sequences of all ages but probably make up less than 1 percent by weight of all sedimentary rocks . In terms of origin and depositional mechanisms , they are closely related to sandstones and exhibit many of the same types of sedimentary structures , e.g. , tabular and trough cross-bedding and graded bedding .",

  "/wiki/Halite": "Halite ( or ) , commonly known as rock salt , is a type of salt , the mineral ( natural ) form of sodium chloride ( Na Cl ) . Halite forms isometric crystals . The mineral is typically colorless or white , but may also be light blue , dark blue , purple , pink , red , orange , yellow or gray depending on inclusion of other materials , impurities , and structural or isotopic abnormalities in the crystals . It commonly occurs with other evaporite deposit minerals such as several of the sulfates , halides , and borates . The name halite is derived from the Ancient Greek word for salt , \u1f05\u03bb\u03c2 ( h\u00e1ls ) .",
  "/wiki/Rip-up_clasts": "Rip-up clasts are pieces of shale or mudstone created when an erosive current containing suspended sediment flows over a shale bed , tears up pieces of it , and carries these rip ups some distance . Because clay can be quite cohesive , even when freshly deposited , large clasts of shale can be ripped up , transported and subsequently preserved when the eroding current finally deposits its sediment . Shale rip-up clasts are often found at the base of sandy turbidites , in lag deposits at the base of channelized sandstones , and associated with subaqueous dunes and bars .",
