He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style - a task that did not prove easy .",
  "/wiki/Carmen": "Carmen [ ka\u0281.m\u025bn ] is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet . The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy , based on a novella of the same title by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e . The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875 , where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences . Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance , unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years . Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon ; the Habanera from act 1 and the Toreador Song from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias . The opera is written in the genre of op\u00e9ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue . It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9 , a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen . Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties , yet loses Carmen 's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo , after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage . The depictions of proletarian life , immorality , and lawlessness , and the tragic death of the main character on stage , broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial . After the premiere , most reviews were critical , and the French public was generally indifferent . Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France , and was not revived in Paris until 1883 . Thereafter , it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad .",
  "/wiki/Georges_Bizet": "Georges Bizet ( , , ; 25 October 18383 June 1875 ) , registered at birth as Alexandre C\u00e9sar L\u00e9opold Bizet , was a French composer of the Romantic era . Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death , Bizet achieved few successes before his final work , Carmen , which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire . During a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris , Bizet won many prizes , including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857 . He was recognised as an outstanding pianist , though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public . Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy , he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers . His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored ; as a result , his career stalled , and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others . Restless for success , he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s , most of which were abandoned . Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time - Les p\u00eacheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth - were immediately successful . After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 , during which Bizet served in the National Guard , he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh , though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet 's play L'Arl\u00e9sienne was instantly popular . The production of Bizet 's final opera , Carmen , was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences . After its premiere on 3 March 1875 , Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure ; he died of a heart attack three months later , unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success . Bizet 's marriage to Genevi\u00e8ve Hal\u00e9vy was intermittently happy and produced one son .",
