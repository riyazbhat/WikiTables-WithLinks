  "/wiki/Cornerback": "A cornerback ( CB ) is a member of the defensive backfield or secondary in gridiron football . Cornerbacks cover receivers most of the time , but also blitz and defend against such offensive running plays as sweeps and reverses . They create turnovers through hard tackles , interceptions , and deflecting forward passes . Other members of the defensive backfield include strong and free safeties . The cornerback position requires speed , agility , and strength . A cornerback 's skill set typically requires proficiency in anticipating the quarterback , backpedaling , executing single and zone coverage , disrupting pass routes , block shedding , and tackling . Cornerbacks are among the fastest players on the field .",

  "/wiki/2014_New_England_Patriots_season": "The 2014 New England Patriots season was the franchise 's 45th season in the National Football League , the 55th overall and the 15th under head coach Bill Belichick . The 2014 season would mark the ten-year anniversary of the Patriots third and most recent Super Bowl win , when they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX . Despite their championship drought , Belichick 's Patriots remained historically dominant throughout much of the 2000s/2010s . They qualified for the playoffs nine times ( missing the 2000 , 2002 and 2008 postseasons ) , reached the AFC Championship five times , appeared in two Super Bowls and , in the eyes of many , solidified Tom Brady 's status as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time . In 2007 , the Patriots completed just the second undefeated regular season in the history of the modern NFL ( the first being their division rival Miami Dolphins in 1972 ) , as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games ( though only the '72 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl ) . It was achievements such as these that made the Patriots a particularly intriguing media target . A miserable loss in week four against the Kansas City Chiefs , where New England dropped to 2-2 , frequent off-field antics of tight-end Rob Gronkowski and highly publicized Deflategate scandal were all important chronicles of the 2014 Patriots wild season , the latter of which would ultimately result in the four-game suspension of Brady for the beginning of the 2016 NFL season . Despite all this , the Patriots managed to emerge victorious in the end . The Patriots finished 12-4 for the third straight year , winning their sixth straight AFC East title , as well as the top-overall seed and home field advantage for the AFC playoffs . With their seeding , New England was awarded a first-round bye in the playoffs for the fifth season in a row , the first such occurrence for any team since the league switched to a 12-team playoff format in 1990 ( surpassing the 1992-95 Dallas Cowboys ) . They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring ( 468 points ) and eighth in points allowed ( 313 ) , and first in point differential ( with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points ) . The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35-31 in the Divisional Round of the playoffs , advancing to their fourth straight AFC Championship game .",

  "/wiki/Tight_End": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players . Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight , since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions .",

  "/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .
