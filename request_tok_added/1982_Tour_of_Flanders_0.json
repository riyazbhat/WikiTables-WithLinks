The highlight of his career was his overall win in the 1977 Giro d'Italia . In the 1978 Tour de France , he was the Belgian national champion when he won the stage arriving in Alpe d'Huez and took the yellow jersey . However , he was accused of foul play in the succeeding doping test , having used what was described politely as a pear-shaped tube ( in fact a condom ) of different urine held under the armpit and connected by a plastic tube to give the impression of urinating . Pollentier was uncovered after another rider at the test had trouble operating his own system of tubes and aroused the suspicion of the doctor , who then demanded Pollentier lift his jersey to show if he too was cheating . He was put out of the Tour , later won by Bernard Hinault . The affair took away most of Pollentier 's credibility in international cycling . Even though he won the 1980s edition of the Tour of Flanders and he also came 2nd in the 1982 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a . 1984 was his last professional season . After his cycling career , Pollentier became a car tyre garage owner and founded a cycling school . In Seigneurs et Forcats du Velo by Olivier Dazat , Pollentier is quoted as saying that he and another named Belgian cycling champion of the era had trouble after their careers because of drugs they had taken while racing .",
