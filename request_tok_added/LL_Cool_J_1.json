  "/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rap_Performance": "The Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance is an honor presented to recording artists for quality rap performances . It was first presented at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1989 and again at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990 , after which point the award was split into two categories : Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group . These two categories were combined again in 2012 as a result of a restructure of Grammy categories , and the reinstated Award for Best Rap Performance was presented at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012 . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony established in 1958 , and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ( NARAS ) of the United States to honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position . The first award for Best Rap Performance was presented to DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince ( the vocal duo consisting of DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith ) for Parents Just Do n't Understand . The ceremony was not without controversy ; nominees Jeff and Smith led a boycott in protest of the awards presentation not being televised , and some members of the rap community felt that more qualified artists were overlooked . Rappers Jay Z and Kanye West are two-time winners of this award . Kendrick Lamar is a four-time winner . The restructuring of the categories and combination of Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group back into Best Rap Performance was the consequence of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ' wish to decrease the number of categories and awards and to eliminate distinctions between solo and duo or group performances .",
