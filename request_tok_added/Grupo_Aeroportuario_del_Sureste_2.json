It was the first Spanish settlement on the mainland of the Americas to receive a coat-of-arms . During the colonial period , this city had the largest mercantile class and was at times wealthier than the capital of Mexico City . Its wealth attracted the raids of 17th-century pirates , against which fortifications such as Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa were built . In the 19th and early 20th centuries , Veracruz was invaded on different occasions by France and the United States ; during the 1914 Tampico Affair , US troops occupied the city for seven months .
