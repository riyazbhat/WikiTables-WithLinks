  "/wiki/Plat": "In the United States , a plat ( or ) ( plan ) is a cadastral map , drawn to scale , showing the divisions of a piece of land . United States General Land Office surveyors drafted township plats of Public Lands Surveys to show the distance and bearing between section corners , sometimes including topographic or vegetation information . City , town or village plats show subdivisions into blocks with streets and alleys . Further refinement often splits blocks into individual lots , usually for the purpose of selling the described lots ; this has become known as subdivision . After the filing of a plat , legal descriptions can refer to block and lot-numbers rather than portions of sections . In order for plats to become legally valid , a local governing body , such as a public works department , urban planning commission , or zoning board must normally review and approve them .",

  "/wiki/Kansas": "Kansas /\u02c8k\u00e6nz\u0259s/ ( listen ) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States . Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita , with its most populated county and largest employment center being Johnson County . Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",
