  "/wiki/Hydrogen_balloon": "A gas balloon is a balloon that rises and floats in the air because it is filled with a gas lighter than air ( such as helium or hydrogen ) . When not in flight , it is tethered to prevent it from flying away and is sealed at the bottom to prevent the escape of gas . A gas balloon may also be called a Charli\u00e8re for its inventor , the Frenchman Jacques Charles . Today , familiar gas balloons include large blimps and small latex party balloons . Blimps have displaced zeppelins ( which are not balloons ) as the dominant form of airship . For nearly 200 years , well into the 20th century , manned balloon flight utilized gas balloons before hot-air balloons became dominant . Without power , heat or fuel , untethered flights of gas balloons depended on the skill of the pilot . Gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume , so they do not need to be so large , and they can stay up for much longer than hot air balloons .",
  "/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico": "The Gulf of Mexico ( Spanish : Golfo de M\u00e9xico ) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean , largely surrounded by the North American continent . It is bounded on the northeast , north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States , on the southwest and south by Mexico , and on the southeast by Cuba . The US states of Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida border the Gulf on the north , which are often referred to as the Third Coast , in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts . The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics . The Gulf of Mexico basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles ( 1,500 km ; 930 mi ) wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments . It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba , and with the Caribbean Sea ( with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea ) via the Yucat\u00e1n Channel between Mexico and Cuba . With the narrow connection to the Atlantic , the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges . The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 ( 615,000 sq mi ) . Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters . The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters ( 550 quadrillion Imperial gallons , 660 quadrillion US gallons , 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi ) . The Gulf of Mexico is one of the most important offshore petroleum production regions in the world , comprising one-sixth of the United States ' total production .",

It is a 69,000-acre estuary located in northwest Florida . It is relatively deep , and of relatively high salinity due to the low freshwater inflow provided by only a few spring-fed creeks ( the most significant being Econfina Creek , fed by Wiliford and Pitts Springs ) . The county seat of Bay County , Panama City , is located on the bay , named for Saint Andrew . The Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay Railway , which ran from Panama City to Dothan , Alabama ( and still exists as a smaller short line ) , was also named for the bay .",

It was lost when it exploded in mid-air on 21 December 1923 off the coast of Sicily , killing all 52 ( 42 crew and ten passengers ) on board . This was one of the first of the great airship disasters , preceded by the crash of the British R38 in 1921 ( 44 dead ) and the US airship Roma in 1922 ( 34 dead ) , and followed by the destruction of the British R101 in 1930 ( 48 dead ) , the USS Akron in 1933 ( 73 dead ) and the German Hindenburg in 1937 ( 36 dead ) .",
  "/wiki/Zeppelin": "A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8t\u0361s\u025bp\u0259li\u02d0n ] ) who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century . Zeppelin 's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893 . They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899 . After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design , the word zeppelin came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships . Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG ( DELAG ) , the world 's first airline in revenue service . By mid-1914 , DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights . During World War I , the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts , killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain . The defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed down the airship business . Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between Berlin , Munich , and Friedrichshafen in 1919 , the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which also prohibited Germany from building large airships . An exception was made allowing the construction of one airship for the US Navy , which saved the company from extinction . In 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted , and with the aid of donations from the public , work was started on the construction of LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin . This revived the company 's fortunes , and during the 1930s , the airships Graf Zeppelin and the larger LZ 129 Hindenburg operated regular transatlantic flights from Germany to North America and Brazil .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946 , 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .",

  "/wiki/Old_Glory_(aircraft)": "The Old Glory was a Fokker F.VIIa single-engined monoplane that was used in 1927 on an attempted transatlantic flight from Old Orchard Beach , Maine , United States to Rome , Italy . The flight was sponsored by William Randolph Hearst to promote his newspaper the New York Daily Mirror . The flight was originally to have departed from Roosevelt Field , New York , but due to the weight of the aircraft it was decided to use a landing field at Old Orchard Beach , which offered a longer takeoff run . At 12:33 EST on 6 September 1927 , the Old Glory departed from Old Orchard Beach for Rome ; it was piloted by James DeWitt Hill , along with fellow aviator Lloyd W. Bertaud as radio operator , and New York Daily Mirror editor Philip Payne as a passenger . Bertaud reported by radio at 14:55 that all was well , but at 15:55 he reported that the aircraft was heavy . The Old Glory was last sighted by the steamship California at 23:57 the same day , 350 miles east of Cape Race , Newfoundland . At 03:57 and 04:03 , the aircraft sent out distress signals ; the nearest ship was Transylvania , which triangulated the position from the two messages and altered course to the estimated location , 65 miles away . The weather was bad with strong winds and rain when Transylvania arrived at the location five hours later . Another four ships joined the search , but after thirty hours it was abandoned . Hearst hired the SS Kyle to search the area again , and on 12 September they found wreckage of the aircraft , but no sign of the crew ; the only trace of the plane was a 34-foot section of wing , found 700 miles east of Cape Race , Newfoundland .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy .

This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses , and has contributed significantly to spreading the city 's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger . The city 's rapid population growth in the late 20th century was primarily a result of Norway 's booming offshore oil industry . Today the oil industry is a key industry in the Stavanger region and the city is widely referred to as the Oil Capital of Norway . [ failed verification ] Norwegian energy company Equinor , the largest company in the Nordic region , is headquartered in Stavanger . Multiple educational institutions for higher education are located in Stavanger . The largest of these is the University of Stavanger . Domestic and international military installations are located in Stavanger , including the NATO Joint Warfare Centre .",

Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount Saint Helens . About 30 miles ( 48 km ) due east of the city of Bellingham , Whatcom County , Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field . While volcanism has persisted here for some 1.5 million years , the current glaciated cone is likely no more than 140,000 years old , and possibly no older than 80-90,000 years . Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation . After Mount Rainier , Mount Baker is the most heavily glaciated of the Cascade Range volcanoes ; the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker , 0.43 cu mi ( 1.79 km3 ) is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes ( except Rainier ) combined . It is also one of the snowiest places in the world ; in 1999 , Mount Baker Ski Area , located 9 mi ( 14.5 km ) to the northeast , set the world record for recorded snowfall in a single season - 1,140 in ( 29 m ; 95 ft ) .

  "/wiki/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning": "The Lockheed P-38 Lightning is a World War II-era American piston-engined fighter aircraft . Developed for the United States Army Air Corps , the P-38 had distinctive twin booms and a central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament . Allied propaganda claimed it had been nicknamed the fork-tailed devil ( German : der Gabelschwanz-Teufel ) by the Luftwaffe and two planes , one pilot by the Japanese . Along with its use as a general fighter , the P-38 was utilized in various aerial combat roles including as a highly effective fighter-bomber , a night fighter , and as a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks . The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder , guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers ; or even other P-38s , equipped with bombs , to their targets . Used in the aerial reconnaissance role , the P-38 would account for 90 percent of the aerial film captured over Europe . The P-38 was used most successfully in the Pacific Theater of Operations and the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations as the aircraft of America 's top aces , Richard Bong ( 40 victories ) , Thomas McGuire ( 38 victories ) and Charles H. MacDonald ( 27 victories ) . In the South West Pacific theater , the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the introduction of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war . Unusual for a fighter of this time , the exhaust was muffled by the turbo-superchargers , making the P-38 's operation relatively quiet . The two turbo-superchargers also provided the P-38 with good high-altitude performance , making it one of the earliest Allied fighters capable of performing at such altitudes . It was extremely forgiving and could be mishandled in many ways , but the rate of roll in the early versions was too low for it to excel as a dogfighter . The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in large-scale production throughout American involvement in the war , from Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day .",

After being demobilised from the French Air Force , he travelled to the United States to help persuade its government to enter the war against Nazi Germany . Following a 27-month hiatus in North America , during which he wrote three of his most important works , he joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa , although he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in declining health . He disappeared and is believed to have died while on a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean in July 1944 . Prior to the war , Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had achieved fame in France as an aviator . His literary works - among them The Little Prince , translated into 300 languages and dialects - posthumously boosted his stature to national hero status in France . He earned further widespread recognition with international translations of his other works . His 1939 philosophical memoir Terre des hommes ( titled Wind , Sand and Stars in English ) became the name of an international humanitarian group ; it was also used to create the central theme of the most successful world 's fair of the 20th century , Expo 67 in Montreal , Quebec .",

Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea .
