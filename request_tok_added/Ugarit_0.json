  "/wiki/Niqmaddu_II": "Niqmaddu II was the second ruler and king of Ugarit , an Ancient Syrian citystate in northwestern Syria , reigning c. 1350-1315 BC ( or possibly c. 1380-1346 BC ) and succeeding his less known father , Ammittamru I . He took his name from the earlier Amorite ruler Niqmaddu , meaning Addu has vindicated to strengthen the supposed origins of his Ugaritic dynasty in the Amorites . Though the exact date of his accession to the throne of Ugarit is unknown , he might be a contemporary of both Akhenaten and Tutankhamun the Hittite ruler Shuppiluliuma I , and was a vassal of the latter . He had good relations with Egypt , and conceded to the Amorites in a dispute over the Shiyannu region early in his reign . He commissioned the Baal cycle about the god Haddu/Ba'al , and had a son , Niqmepa . In EA 49 , Niqmaddu II apparently requested an Egyptian physician and two palace attendants from Cush , the Egyptian envoy to Ugarit . He is identified in Syrian on an alabaster vase along with a woman in Egyptian court dress , however , the name of the woman in the vase , if ever indicated , is not preserved and is mentioned in the Baal cycle as King nqmd . He was succeeded briefly by Ar-Halba .",

He achieved fame as a great warrior and statesman , successfully challenging the then-dominant Egyptian empire for control of the lands between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates .",
  "/wiki/Hittites": "The Hittites ( /\u02c8h\u026ata\u026ats/ ) were an Anatolian people who played an important role in establishing an empire centered on Hattusa in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC . This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I , when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia . Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC , the Empire of Hattusa , conventionally called the Hittite Empire , came into conflict with the Egyptian Empire , Middle Assyrian Empire and the empire of the Mitanni for control of the Near East . The Assyrians eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire , while the remainder was sacked by Phrygian newcomers to the region . After c. 1180 BC , during the Bronze Age collapse , the Hittites splintered into several independent Neo-Hittite city-states , some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the Neo-Assyrian Empire . The Hittite language was a distinct member of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family , and along with the related Luwian language , is the oldest historically attested Indo-European language , referred to by its speakers as ne\u0161ili in the language of Nesa . The Hittites called their country the Kingdom of Hattusa ( Hatti in Akkadian ) , a name received from the Hattians , an earlier people who inhabited the region until the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC and spoke an unrelated language known as Hattic . The conventional name Hittites is due to their initial identification with the Biblical Hittites in 19th century archaeology . The history of the Hittite civilization is known mostly from cuneiform texts found in the area of their kingdom , and from diplomatic and commercial correspondence found in various archives in Assyria , Babylonia , Egypt and the Middle East , the decipherment of which was also a key event in the history of Indo-European linguistics . The Hittite military made successful use of chariots . The development of iron smelting was once attributed to the Hittites of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age , with their success largely based on the advantages of a monopoly on ironworking at the time . But the view of such a Hittite monopoly has come under scrutiny and is no longer a scholarly consensus .",
  "/wiki/Arhalba": "Ar-Halba was the third known ruler of Ugarit , an Ancient Syrian city state in northwestern Syria , reigning for no less than two years , possibly from 1315 to 1313 BC . Succeeding king Niqmaddu II . Very little is known about his short reign , as he is only mentioned in six juridical texts . The one that gives the most information about him is his 'Last will ' , where he warns his brothers not to marry his wife Kubaba after his death , contrary to the levirate custom . The intriguing letter gave room to plenty of spectaculation about him , with his non-Semitic name that stands out amongst all Ugaritan kings further enhancing the mystery , with some even suggesting that he was not the legitimate heir to the throne . Later on , he was supposedly forced by the Hittite king Mursili II to abdicate the throne , in favour of his brother , Niqmepa . He was probably sent to exile afterwards .",
  "/wiki/Mursili_II": "Mursili II ( also spelled Mursilis II ) was a king of the Hittite Empire ( New kingdom ) c. 1321-1295 BC ( short chronology ) .",
  "/wiki/Niqmepa": "Niqmepa ( died 1270 BC ) was the fifth-from-last King of Ugarit , a city-state in northwestern Syria . Niqmepa was a contemporary of Mursili II and Hattusili III , the great Hittite kings , as well as Horemheb and Seti I of Egypt .",
  "/wiki/Ammittamru_II": "Ammittamru II was a king of the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit who ruled from 1260 to 1235 BC . He reigned for 25 years , being the son of former king Niqmepa , who was famously forced to sign a treaty of vassalization to the Hittites . Like all other Ugaritan kings , very few references of him exist . However , he is known to be a contemporary of Bentisina of the Amurru . Ammittamru II is assumed to have used the seal of his grandfather , Niqmaddu II instead of the dynastic seal that reads : Yaqarum , son of Niqmaddu , king of Ugarit , that was normally used by Ugaritan kings .",
  "/wiki/Amurru_kingdom": "Amurru was an Amorite kingdom established c. 2000 BC , in a region spanning present-day western and north-western Syria and northern Lebanon . The first documented leader of Amurru was Abdi-Ashirta , under whose leadership Amurru was part of the Egyptian empire . His son Aziru made contact with the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I , and eventually defected to the Hittites . The Amurru kingdom was destroyed by the Sea Peoples around 1200 B.C .",
  "/wiki/Ibiranu": "Ibiranu ( reigned 1235 BC - 1225/20 BC ) was the sixth king of Ugarit , a city-state in northwestern Syria . He was the second-eldest son of Ammittamru II . Ibiranu 's older step-brother and heir apparent to the throne , Utri-Sarruma , decided to leave the kingdom when his mother 's marriage was annulled , and Ibiranu became the next king of Ugarit . Ibiranu reigned between c. 1235 and 1225/20 BC , and was a contemporary of Tudhaliya IV and Arnuwanda III of Hatti . As a vassal state of Hatti the king was answerable to the viceroy at Carchemish . After he became king , Ibiranu failed to present himself to the Hatti overlord as the diplomatic protocol of a vassal state required him to do . His failure to do so , and to send valuable gifts to compensate for his mistake raised concerns and he received several letters of reprimand from the local viceroy , Ini-Teshup , and the king 's son , Pihawalwi . The letters , discovered among the cuneiform tablets found at Ugarit , also revealed that Ibiranu failed to send sufficient troops to participate in the king 's campaigns . On suspicion that Ibiranu was keeping his best chariots in Ugarit , a letter from the Carchemish viceroy states that an inspector from the Hatti king would be sent to Ugarit to verify the number of troops at Ibiranu 's disposal . The king 's reluctance to present his allegiance to the Hittites seems to suggest a loss of confidence in their protection . This explanation is corroborated by a letter found in the Ugaritic archives addressed to Ibiranu from the Assyrian king , Tukulti-Ninurta I , describing the heavy defeat he inflicted on the Hittites in northern Mesopotamia .",
  "/wiki/Letter_of_Piha-walwi": "The Letter of Prince Piha-walwi of Hatti to King Ibiranu of Ugarit ( CTH 110 ) is a Hittite diplomatic text of the 13th century BC . Piha-walwi complains to King Ibiranu of Ugarit , that he had not sought an audience with the Hittite king , presumably Tudhaliya IV , asking him to rectify this immediately and to send messengers with gifts for the king and for Piha-walwi himself . Ibiranu seems to have complied , as in another letter , the Ugaritic ambassador to Hattusa warns Ibiranu that the Hittite king was offended by the inferior gems he received , recommending that the king expects to be presented with lapis lazuli .",
  "/wiki/Ammurapi": "Ammurapi was the last Bronze Age ruler and king ( c. 1215 to 1180 BC ) of the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit . Ammurapi was a contemporary of the Hittite King Suppiluliuma II . He wrote a preserved vivid letter ( RS 18.147 ) in response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alashiya . The letter dramatically highlights the desperate situation facing Ugarit while it was also under attack by the invading Sea Peoples . Ammurapi wrote : Ugarit would become one of the many states of the ancient Near East that were destroyed or abandoned during the Bronze Age collapse . Suppiluliuma II was responsible for the divorce settlement between Ammurapi and a Hittite woman , but it did not cause a problem between the Kingdom of Ugarit and the Hittite Empire ; instead it demonstrated the relationship between both kingdoms .",
  "/wiki/Chancellor_Bay": "Bay , also called Ramesse Khamenteru , ( died 1192 BC ) was an important Asiatic official in ancient Egypt , who rose to prominence and high office under Seti II Userkheperure Setepenre and later became an influential powerbroker in the closing stages of the 19th Dynasty . He was generally identified with Irsu ( alt . Arsu , Iarsu , Yarsu ) mentioned in the Great Harris Papyrus , although no contemporary source connects Bay with Irsu . Bay 's importance is emphasized by the fact that he was given permission , possibly by Seti II but more probably by Siptah , to construct his own tomb in Egypt 's Valley of the Kings ( KV13 ) . His tomb was clearly constructed as part of a triad of tombs , including that of the Pharaoh Siptah and Queen Twosret . This was an unprecedented privilege , the likes of which were rarely accorded to a commoner , let alone a foreigner ( though previous exceptions , such as that of Yuya , have occurred ) . It is possible that Bay was accorded this tomb because he was a relation of Siptah 's mother , a Canaanite concubine of Seti II , or perhaps even of Amenmesse . His tomb was later usurped under the Twentieth Dynasty by prince Mentuherkhepshef , a son of Ramesses IX .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites . Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy ."
