  "/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1992 United States presidential election was the 52nd quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 3 , 1992 . Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas defeated incumbent Republican President George H. W. Bush , independent businessman Ross Perot of Texas , and a number of minor candidates . Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes , but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan . Bush 's popularity after his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries . Clinton , a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries . He defeated former and future Governor of California Jerry Brown , former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas , and other candidates to win his party 's nomination , and chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate . Billionaire Ross Perot launched an independent campaign , emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his plan to reduce the national debt . The economy was in recession and Bush 's greatest strength , foreign policy , was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War . Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992 , but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July . The Bush campaign criticized Clinton 's character and emphasized Bush 's foreign policy successes , while Clinton focused on the economy . Clinton won a plurality in the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote , breaking a streak of three straight Republican victories .",
