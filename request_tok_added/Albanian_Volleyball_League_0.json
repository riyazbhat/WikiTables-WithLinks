The city was awarded the title of the European Youth Capital of 2022 . Tirana is located in the center of Albania and is enclosed by mountains and hills with Mount Dajt elevating on the east and a slight valley on the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance . Due to its location within the Plain of Tirana and the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea , the city is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean seasonal climate . It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe , with 2,544 hours of sun per year . Tirana flourished as a city in 1614 but the region that today corresponds to the city 's territory has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age . The city 's territory was inhabited by several Illyrian tribes but had no importance within Illyria . Indeed , it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars . The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana . Later , in the 5th and 6th centuries , a Paleochristian basilica was built around this site . After the Roman Empire split into East and West in the 4th century , its successor the Byzantine Empire took control over most of Albania , and built the Petrel\u00eb Castle in the reign of Justinian I . The city was fairly unimportant until the 20th century , when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as Albania 's capital , after the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912 .",
