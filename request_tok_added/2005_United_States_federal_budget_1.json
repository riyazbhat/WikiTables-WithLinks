  "/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States": "Income taxes in the United States are imposed by the federal , most states , and many local governments .

  "/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)": "In the United States of America , Social Security is the commonly used term for the federal Old-Age , Survivors , and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) program and is administered by the Social Security Administration . The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 , and the current version of the Act , as amended , encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs . Social Security is funded primarily through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax ( FICA ) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax ( SECA ) . Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund , the two Social Security Trust Funds . With a few exceptions , all salaried income , up to an amount specifically determined by law ( see tax rate table below ) , is subject to the Social Security payroll tax . All income over said amount is not taxed . In 2020 , the maximum amount of taxable earnings is $ 137,700 . With few exceptions , all legal residents working in the United States now have an individual Social Security number . Indeed , nearly all working ( and many non-working ) residents since Social Security 's 1935 inception have had a Social Security number because it is requested by a wide range of businesses . In 2017 , Social Security expenditures totaled $ 806.7 billion for OASDI and $ 145.8 billion for DI . Income derived from Social Security is currently estimated to have reduced the poverty rate for Americans age 65 or older from about 40% to below 10% . In 2018 , the trustees of the Social Security Trust Fund reported that the program will become financially insolvent in the year 2034 unless corrective action is enacted by Congress .",
  "/wiki/Payroll_tax": "Payroll taxes are taxes imposed on employers or employees , and are usually calculated as a percentage of the salaries that employers pay their staff . Payroll taxes generally fall into two categories : deductions from an employees wages , and taxes paid by the employer based on the employee 's wages . The first kind are taxes that employers are required to withhold from employees ' wages , also known as withholding tax , pay-as-you-earn tax ( PAYE ) , or pay-as-you-go tax ( PAYG ) and often covering advance payment of income tax , social security contributions , and various insurances ( e.g. , unemployment and disability ) . The second kind is a tax that is paid from the employer 's own funds and that is directly related to employing a worker . These can consist of fixed charges or be proportionally linked to an employee 's pay . The charges paid by the employer usually cover the employer 's funding of the social security system , medicare , and other insurance programs . It is sometimes claimed that the economic burden of the payroll tax falls almost entirely on the worker , regardless of whether the tax is remitted by the employer or the employee , as the employers share of payroll taxes is passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid . Because payroll taxes fall exclusively on wages and not on returns to financial or physical investments , payroll taxes may contribute to underinvestment in human capital such as higher education .",
  "/wiki/Excise_tax_in_the_United_States": "Excise tax in the United States is an indirect tax on listed items . Excise taxes can be and are made by federal , state and local governments and are not uniform throughout the United States . Some excise taxes are collected from the producer or retailer and not paid directly by the consumer , and as such often remain hidden in the price of a product or service , rather than being listed separately .",
  "/wiki/Inheritance_tax": "An inheritance tax is a tax paid by a person who inherits money or property of a person who has died , whereas an estate tax is a levy on the estate ( money and property ) of a person who has died . International tax law distinguishes between an estate tax and an inheritance tax - an estate tax is assessed on the assets of the deceased , while an inheritance tax is assessed on the legacies received by the estate 's beneficiaries . However , this distinction is not always observed ; for example , the UK 's inheritance tax is a tax on the assets of the deceased , and strictly speaking is therefore an estate tax . For historical reasons , the term death duty is still used colloquially ( though not legally ) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries .",
  "/wiki/Gift_tax": "In economics , a gift tax is the tax on money or property that one living person gives to another . Items received upon the death of another are considered separately under the inheritance tax . Many gifts are not subject to taxation because of exemptions given in tax laws . The gift tax amount varies by jurisdiction , and international comparison of rates is complex and fluid .",
  "/wiki/Customs": "Customs is an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods , including animals , transports , personal , and hazardous items , into and out of a country . The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by migration authorities , under a variety of names and arrangements . Immigration authorities normally check for appropriate documentation , verify that a person is entitled to enter the country , apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants , and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country . Compare illegal emigration . Traditionally customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties and other taxes on import or export . In recent decades , the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues : taxation , security and trade facilitation . The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 , 2001 , has become the factor that prompted a significant strengthening of the security component in the operations of the modern customs authorities , after which security-oriented control measures for supply chains have been widely implemented for the aims of preventing risk identification . The most complete guidelines for customs security functions implementation is provided in the WCO SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade ( SAFE ) , which have already received five editions in 2005 , 2007 , 2010 , 2012 and 2018 . The trade facilitation objectives were introduced into routine of customs authorities in order to reduce trade transaction costs . The contemporary understanding of the trade facilitation concept is based on the Recommendation No . 4 of UN / CEFACT National Trade Facilitation Bodies . According to its provisions ( Para .",
