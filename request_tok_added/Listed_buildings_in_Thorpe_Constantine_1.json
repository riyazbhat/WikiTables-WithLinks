  "/wiki/Conglomerate_(geology)": "Conglomerate ( ) is a coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of a substantial fraction of rounded to subangular gravel-size clasts , e.g. , granules , pebbles , cobbles , and boulders , larger than in diameter . Conglomerates form by the consolidation and lithification of gravel . Conglomerates typically contain finer grained sediment , e.g. , either sand , silt , clay or combination of them , called matrix by geologists , filling their interstices and are often cemented by calcium carbonate , iron oxide , silica , or hardened clay . The size and composition of the gravel-size fraction of a conglomerate may or may not vary in composition , sorting , and size . In some conglomerates , the gravel-size class consist almost entirely of what were clay clasts at the time of deposition . Conglomerates can be found in sedimentary rock sequences of all ages but probably make up less than 1 percent by weight of all sedimentary rocks . In terms of origin and depositional mechanisms , they are closely related to sandstones and exhibit many of the same types of sedimentary structures , e.g. , tabular and trough cross-bedding and graded bedding .",
  "/wiki/Freestone_(masonry)": "A freestone is a stone used in masonry for molding , tracery and other replication work required to be worked with the chisel . Freestone , so named because it can be freely cut in any direction , must be fine-grained , uniform and soft enough to be cut easily without shattering or splitting . Some sources , including numerous nineteenth century dictionaries , say that the stone has no grain , but this is incorrect . Oolitic stones are generally used , although in some countries soft sandstones are used ; in some churches an indurated chalk called clunch is employed for internal lining and for carving . Some believe that freemason originally meant one who is capable of carving freestone .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",
  "/wiki/Decorated_Gothic": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Steeple": "A steeple , in architecture , is a tall tower on a building , topped by a spire and often incorporating a belfry and other components . Steeples are very common on Christian churches and cathedrals and the use of the term generally connotes a religious structure . They may be stand-alone structures , or incorporated into the entrance or center of the building .",

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Lucarne": "In architecture , a lucarne is a feature of a warehouse , mill or factory . A window or opening high up on an outside wall supports a hoist above doors on the floors below . The original term French : lucarne refers to a dormer window , usually set into the middle of a roof although it can also apply to a facade lucarne , where the gable of the lucarne is aligned with the face of the wall . This general meaning is also preserved in British use , particularly for small windows into unoccupied attic or spire spaces . Pevsner gives its meaning as a small gabled opening in a roof or a spire .",
  "/wiki/Crocket": "A crocket ( or croquet ) is a hook-shaped decorative element common in Gothic architecture . The name derives from the diminutive of the French croc , meaning hook , due to the resemblance of crockets to a bishop 's crosier .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Gargoyle": "In architecture , a gargoyle ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0r\u0261\u0254\u026al/ ) is a carved or formed grotesque:6-8 with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building , thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between . Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm . A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth . Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall . When Gothic flying buttresses were used , aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls .",
  "/wiki/Finial": "A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object , often formed to be a decorative feature . In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies . The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage ( including semi-formal ceremonies ) . The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike .",
  "/wiki/English_country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Plinth": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Belt_course": "A belt course , also called a string course or sill course , is a continuous row or layer of stones or brick set in a wall . Set in line with window sills , it helps to make the horizontal line of the sills visually more prominent . Set between the floors of a house , it helps to make the separate floors distinguishable from the exterior of the building . The belt course often projects from the side of the building . Georgian architecture is notable for the use of belt courses . Although the belt course has its origins as a structural component of a building , by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose . In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories , however , a shelf angle is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden , interior steel wall . Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water . Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing , a belt course is often used .",
  "/wiki/Eaves": "The eaves are the edges of the roof which overhang the face of a wall and , normally , project beyond the side of a building . The eaves form an overhang to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style , such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Wrought_iron": "Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon ( less than 0.08% ) content in contrast to cast iron ( 2.1% to 4% ) . It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions ( up to 2% by weight ) , which gives it a grain resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure . Wrought iron is tough , malleable , ductile , corrosion-resistant and easily welded . Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel , wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron . It was given the name wrought because it was hammered , rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag . [ note 1 ] The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel , also called low-carbon steel . Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardenable by heating and quenching . :145 Wrought iron is highly refined , with a small amount of slag forged out into fibres . It consists of around 99.4% iron by mass . The presence of slag is beneficial for blacksmithing operations , and gives the material its unique fibrous structure . The silicate filaments of the slag also protect the iron from corrosion and diminish the effect of fatigue caused by shock and vibration . Historically , a modest amount of wrought iron was refined into steel , which was used mainly to produce swords , cutlery , chisels , axes and other edged tools as well as springs and files .",
  "/wiki/Balustrade": "A baluster is a vertical moulded shaft , square , or lathe-turned form found in stairways , parapets , and other architectural features . In furniture construction it is known as a spindle . Common materials used in its construction are wood , stone , and less frequently metal and ceramic . A group of balusters supporting handrail , coping , or ornamental detail are known as a balustrade . The term baluster shaft is used to describe forms such as a candlestick , upright furniture support , and the stem of a brass chandelier . [ citation needed ] The term banister ( also bannister ) refers to the system of balusters and handrail of a stairway . It may be used to include its supporting structures , such as a supporting newel post .",
  "/wiki/Pier_(architecture)": "A pier , in architecture , is an upright support for a structure or superstructure such as an arch or bridge . Sections of structural walls between openings ( bays ) can function as piers .",
  "/wiki/Rustication_(architecture)": "In classical architecture rustication is a range of masonry techniques giving visible surfaces a finish that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished , squared-block masonry surfaces called ashlar . The visible face of each individual block is cut back around the edges to make its size and placing very clear . In addition the central part of the face of each block may be given a deliberately rough or patterned surface . Rusticated masonry is usually dressed , or squared off neatly , on all sides of the stones except the face that will be visible when the stone is put in place . This is given wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block , by angling the edges ( channel-jointed ) , or dropping them back a little . The main part of the exposed face may be worked flat and smooth or left with , or worked , to give a more or less rough or patterned surface . Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above . Though intended to convey a rustic simplicity , the finish is highly artificial , and the faces of the stones often carefully worked to achieve an appearance of a coarse finish . Rustication was used in ancient times , but became especially popular in the revived classical styles of Italian Renaissance architecture and that of subsequent periods , above all in the lower floors of secular buildings . It remains in use in some modern architecture . Similar finishes are very common in medieval architecture , especially in castles , walls and similar buildings , but here it merely arises from an unwillingness to spend the extra money required for ashlar masonry in a particular building , and lacks the deliberate emphasis on the joints between blocks . Though it often achieves a decorative effect , this is something of a by-product , and the exploitation for architectural effect within a single building of contrasts between rusticated and ashlar surfaces is rarely seen .",
  "/wiki/Voussoir": "A voussoir is a wedge-shaped element , typically a stone , which is used in building an arch or vault . Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir , two units are of distinct functional importance : the keystone and the springer . The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch . The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side , located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier . The keystone is often decorated or enlarged . An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in Mannerist arches of the 16th century , beginning with the works of Giulio Romano , who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings , rather than a lintel ( Palazzo Stati Maccarani , Rome , circa 1522 ) . The word is a mason 's term borrowed in Middle English from French verbs connoting a 'turn ' ( OED ) . Each wedge-shaped voussoir turns aside the thrust of the mass above , transferring it from stone to stone to the springer 's bottom face ( 'impost ' ) , which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports . Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently , and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone , as in an arch bridge . In Visigothic and Moorish architectural traditions , the voussoirs are often in alternating colours , usually red and white . This is sometimes found in Romanesque architecture also . During the 18th and 19th centuries , British bricklayers became aware that , by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top , they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former ' , or over specially constructed timber falsework ( temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete ) .",

The term can also apply to all sides , including the vertical members , of a frame with mouldings around a door or window . The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings ( or other elements ) framing the top of a door , window or other rectangular opening , where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join ( forming a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint ) .",

  "/wiki/Lintel_(architecture)": "A lintel or lintol is a structural horizontal block that spans the space or opening between two vertical supports . It can be a decorative architectural element , or a combined ornamented structural item . It is often found over portals , doors , windows and fireplaces . In the case of windows , the bottom span is instead referred to as a sill , but , unlike a lintel , does not serve to bear a load to ensure the integrity of the wall . Modern day lintels are made using prestressed concrete and are also referred to as beams in beam and block slabs or ribs in rib and block slabs . These prestressed concrete lintels and blocks are components that are packed together and propped to form a suspended floor concrete slab .",
  "/wiki/Keystone_(architecture)": "A keystone ( also known as capstone ) is the wedge-shaped stone at the apex of a masonry arch or typically round-shaped one at the apex of a vault . In both cases it is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position , allowing the arch or vault to bear weight . In arches and vaults ( such as quasi-domes ) keystones are often enlarged beyond the structural requirements and decorated . A variant in domes and crowning vaults is a lantern . Keystones , as a hallmark of strength or good architecture , or their suggested form are sometimes placed in the centre of the flat top of doors , recesses and windows for decorative effect , so as to form an upward projection of a lintel . Although a masonry arch or vault can not be self-supporting until the keystone is placed , the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs , due to its position at the apex . Old keystones can decay due to vibration , a condition known as bald arch . In a rib-vaulted ceiling , keystones commonly mark the intersections of any two or more arched ribs . For aesthetics , keystones are often larger than ribs in vaults and many of the voussoirs ( arch stones ) in arches , or embellished with a boss . Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones , as in the church house entrance portal at Colditz Castle ( see image ) . Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio , a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect .",
  "/wiki/Pedestal": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",
  "/wiki/Festoon": "A festoon ( from French feston , Italian festone , from a Late Latin festo , originally a festal garland , Latin festum , feast ) is a wreath or garland hanging from two points , and in architecture typically a carved ornament depicting conventional arrangement of flowers , foliage or fruit bound together and suspended by ribbons . The motif is sometimes known as a swag when depicting fabric or linen . In modern English the verb forms , especially festooned with , are often used very loosely or figuratively to mean having any type of fancy decoration or covering .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war ."
