  "/wiki/Suibne_mac_Cin\u00e1eda": "Suibne mac Cin\u00e1eda ( died 1034 ) was an eleventh-century ruler of the Gall Gaidheil , a population of mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity . There is little known of Suibne as he is only attested in three sources that record the year of his death . He seems to have ruled in a region where Gall Gaidheil are known to have dwelt : either the Hebrides , the Firth of Clyde region , or somewhere along the south-western coast of Scotland from the Firth of Clyde southwards into Galloway . Suibne 's patronym , meaning son of Cin\u00e1ed , may indicate that he was a member of the royal Alp\u00ednid dynasty . For instance , the patronym could be evidence that he was a brother of the reigning M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda , King of Alba , or else a son of Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib , King of Alba . Suibne 's career appears to have coincided with an expansion of the Gall Gaidheil along the south-west coast of what is today Scotland . This extension of power may have partially contributed to the destruction of the Kingdom of Strathclyde , an embattled realm which then faced aggressions from Dublin Vikings , Northumbrians , and Scots . The circumstances of Suibne 's death are unknown , although one possibility could be that he was caught up in the vicious dynastic-strife endured by the Alp\u00ednids .",
  "/wiki/Echmarcach_mac_Ragnaill": "Echmarcach mac Ragnaill ( died 1064/1065 ) was a dominant figure in the eleventh-century Irish Sea region . [ note 1 ] At his height , he reigned as king over Dublin , the Isles , and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway . The precise identity of Echmarcach 's father , Ragnall , is uncertain . One possibility is that this man was one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford . Another possibility is that Echmarcach 's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles . If any of these identifications are correct , Echmarcach may have been a member of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair kindred . Echmarcach first appears on record in about 1031 , when he was one of three kings in northern Britain who submitted to Kn\u00fatr Sveinnsson , ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire . Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 1036-1038 and 1046-1052 . After losing Dublin for the final time , he appears to have been seated in the Isles on Mann . In 1061 , about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin , Echmarcach appears to have been expelled from the Isles , and may have then fallen back into Galloway . Echmarcach appears to have forged an alliance with the powerful U\u00ed Briain . A leading member of this kindred , Donnchad mac Briain , King of Munster , was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill , a woman who could have been closely related to Echmarcach .",
  "/wiki/Fergus_of_Galloway": "Fergus of Galloway ( died 12 May 1161 ) was a twelfth-century Lord of Galloway . Although his familial origins are unknown , it is possible that he was of Norse-Gaelic ancestry . Fergus first appears on record in 1136 , when he witnessed a charter of David I , King of Scotland . There is considerable evidence indicating that Fergus was married to a bastard daughter of Henry I , King of England . Although the identity of this woman is unknown , it is possible that she was the mother of Fergus 's three children . Fergus forged a marital alliance with \u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson , King of the Isles through the marriage of the latter to Fergus 's daughter , Affraic . As a consequence of this union , the leading branch of the Crovan dynasty descended from Fergus . When \u00d3l\u00e1fr was assassinated by a rival branch of the dynasty , Galloway itself was attacked before Fergus 's grandson , Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson , was able to seize control of Isles . Both Fergus and his grandson appear to have overseen military operations in Ireland , before the latter was overthrown by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte , Lord of Argyll . The fact that there is no record of Fergus lending Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r support against Somairle could be evidence of a slackening of Fergus 's authority . Contemporary sources certainly report that Galloway was wracked by inter-dynastic strife during the decade . Fergus 's fall from power came in 1160 , after Malcolm IV , King of Scotland settled a dispute amongst his leading magnates and launched three military campaigns into Galloway .",
  "/wiki/Uchtred,_Lord_of_Galloway": "Uchtred mac Fergusa ( - 22 September 1174 ) was Lord of Galloway from 1161 to 1174 , ruling jointly with his half-brother Gille Brigte ( Gilbert ) . They were sons of Fergus of Galloway ; their mothers ' names are unknown , but Uchtred may have been born to one of the many illegitimate daughters of Henry I of England . As a boy he was sent as a hostage to the court of King Malcolm IV of Scotland . When his father , Prince Fergus , died in 1161 , Uchtred was made co-ruler of Galloway along with Gilla Brigte . They participated in the disastrous invasion of Northumberland under William I of Scotland in 1174 . King William was captured , and the Galwegians rebelled , taking the opportunity to slaughter the Normans and English in their land . During this time Uchtred was brutally mutilated , blinded , castrated , and killed by his brother Gille Brigte and Gille Brigte 's son , M\u00e1el Coluim . Gille Brigte then seized control of the whole of Galloway . Uchtred had married Gunhilda of Dunbar , daughter of Waltheof of Allerdale and they were the parents of Lochlann and Eve of Galloway , wife of Walter de Berkeley .",
  "/wiki/Gille_Brigte,_Lord_of_Galloway": "Gille Brigte or Gilla Brigte mac Fergusa of Galloway ( died 1185 ) , also known as Gillebrigte , Gille Brighde , Gilbridge , Gilbride , etc. , and most famously known in French sources as Gilbert , was Lord of Galloway of Scotland ( from 1161 with Uchtred ; 1174 alone , to 1185 ) . Gilla Brigte was one of two sons of the great Fergus , the builder of the Kingdom of Galloway .",
  "/wiki/Lochlann,_Lord_of_Galloway": "Lochlann ( died December 12 , 1200 ) , also known by his French name Roland fitz Uhtred , was the son and successor of Uchtred , Lord of Galloway as the Lord or sub-king of eastern Galloway . After the death of his uncle Gille Brigte in 1185 , Lochlann went about to seize the land of Gille Brigte 's heirs . In this aim he had to defeat the men who would defy his authority in the name of Gille Brigte 's heir . He seems to have done so , defeating the resistors , who were led by men called Gille P\u00e1traic and Henric Cenn\u00e9dig . Yet resistance continued under a warrior called Gille Coluim of Galloway . Lochlann 's aims moreover encouraged the wrath of a more important political figure than any of the above . King Henry II of England was outraged . A few years before Gille Brigte 's death , Henry had taken his son and successor Donnchad as a hostage . Hence Henry was the patron and protector of the man Lochlann was trying to disinherit . When King William of Scotland was ordered to visit Henry in southern England , William was told that Lochlann must be stopped . However , William and Lochlann were friends , and so in the end Henry himself brought an army to Carlisle , and threatened to invade unless Lochlann would submit to his judgment . Lochlann did so .",
  "/wiki/Alan,_Lord_of_Galloway": "Alan of Galloway ( before 1199 - 1234 ) , also known as Alan fitz Roland , was a leading thirteenth-century Scottish magnate . As the hereditary Lord of Galloway and Constable of Scotland , he was one of the most influential men in the Kingdom of Scotland and Irish Sea zone . Alan first appears in courtly circles in about 1200 , about the time he inherited his father 's possessions and offices . After he secured his mother 's inheritance almost two decades later , Alan became one of the most powerful magnates in the Scottish realm . Alan also held lands in the Kingdom of England , and was an advisor of John , King of England concerning Magna Carta . Alan later played a considerable part in Alexander II , King of Scotland 's northern English ambitions during the violent aftermath of John 's repudiation of Magna Carta . Alan participated in the English colonisation of Ulster , receiving a massive grant in the region from the English king , and simultaneously aided the Scottish crown against rebel claimants in the western and northern peripheries of the Scottish realm . Alan entered into a vicious inter-dynastic struggle for control of the Kingdom of the Isles , supporting one of his kinsmen against another . Alan 's involvement in the Isles , a region under nominal Norwegian authority , provoked a massive military response by H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson , King of Norway , causing a severe crisis for the Scottish crown . As ruler of the semi-autonomous Lordship of Galloway , Alan was courted by the Scottish and English kings for his remarkable military might , and was noted in Norse saga-accounts as one of the greatest warriors of his time . Like other members of his family , he was a generous religious patron . Alan died in February 1234 ."
