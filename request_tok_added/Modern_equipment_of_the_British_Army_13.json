Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland . Otherwise , the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to the east , the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to the southwest , giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world .

  "/wiki/Armoured_Vehicle_Royal_Engineers": "Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers ( AVRE ) , also known as Assault Vehicle Royal Engineers is the title given to a series of armoured military engineering vehicles operated by the Royal Engineers ( RE ) for the purpose of protecting engineers during frontline battlefield operations . In protecting engineers , the vehicles also became a mobile platform for a variety of engineering purposes , mounting large calibre weapons for demolition , carrying engineering stores , mine clearance explosives , a variety of deployable roadways , and modified engineering bridges for gaps that the related Armoured Ramp Carrier ( ARK ) vehicles could not overcome .",
  "/wiki/Python_Minefield_Breaching_System": "The Python Minefield Breaching System is used by the British Army to clear minefields . It replaces the Giant Viper , and has the ability to clear a safe lane in minefields 180-200m long and 7.3 m wide through which vehicles can pass . The system works by firing a single rocket from a launcher mounted on a 136 kilogramme trailer which has to be towed to the edge of the mined area . Attached to the rocket motor 250 mm L9 53 kg is a 228 m long hose packed with 1455 kg of pe6/al explosive . After the hose lands on the ground it detonates and destroys over 90% of mines along its entire length . The 10% that are not destroyed are simply pushed aside to safety . It can be used in tandem to defeat double impulse mines or mines of greater depth . It also contains a 9 kg high explosive substitute at the end with a .9 kg booster of pe4 . Python has been used operationally with the Trojan AVRE in Afghanistan . During Operation Moshtarak the Royal Engineers attempted to use this traditional mine clearance equipment in the Counter-IED role in support of a major British Army advance .",
  "/wiki/Challenger_2": "The FV4034 Challenger 2 ( MOD designation CR2 ) is a third generation British main battle tank ( MBT ) in service with the armies of the United Kingdom and Oman . It was designed and built by the British company Vickers Defence Systems ( now known as BAE Systems Land & Armaments ) . Vickers Defence Systems began to develop a successor to Challenger 1 as a private venture in 1986 . A \u00a390 million deal for a demonstrator vehicle was finalised in January 1989 . In June 1991 , the Ministry of Defence placed a \u00a3520 million order for 140 vehicles , with a further 268 ordered in 1994 . Production began in 1993 and the unit 's tanks were delivered in July 1994 , replacing the Challenger 1 . The tank entered service with the British Army in 1998 , with the last delivered in 2002 . It is expected to remain in service until 2035 . The Royal Army of Oman ordered 18 Challenger 2s in 1993 and a further 20 tanks in November 1997 . The Challenger 2 is an extensive redesign of the Challenger 1 . Although the hull and automotive components seem similar , they are of a newer design and build than those of the Challenger 1 and only around 3% of components are interchangeable . A visual recognition feature is the armoured housing for the TOGS thermal gunsight : the Challenger 2 has this above the gun barrel , the Challenger 1 has it at the right hand side of the turret .",
  "/wiki/Armoured_vehicle-launched_bridge": "An armoured vehicle-launched bridge ( AVLB ) is a combat support vehicle , sometimes regarded as a subtype of military engineering vehicle , designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles across gap-type obstacles , such as ( and primarily ) rivers . The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of weapons . The AVLB 's job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross craters , anti-tank ditches , blown bridges , railroad cuts , canals , rivers and ravines ) , when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached , and no bridge is conveniently located ( or sufficiently sturdy , a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks ) . The bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo , providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes . Once the span has been put in place , the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge , and moves aside to allow traffic to pass . Once all of the vehicles have crossed , it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side . It then retracts the span ready to move off again . A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions . AVLBs can carry bridges of 60 feet ( 19 metres ) or greater in length . By using a tank chassis , the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as main battle tanks , and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire . However , this is not a universal attribute : some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications .",
  "/wiki/Armoured_recovery_vehicle": "An armoured recovery vehicle ( ARV ) is typically a powerful tank or armoured personnel carrier ( APC ) chassis modified for use during combat for towing or repair of battle-damaged , stuck , and/or inoperable armoured fighting vehicles , such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) . Most ARVs have motorized tracks , like a tank or bulldozer , enabling the ARV to operate on uneven ground . The term Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle ( ARRV ) is also used . ARVs may have winches , jibs , cranes , and/or bulldozer blades to aid in tank recovery . Typically , any specialized lifting and recovery equipment replaces the turret and cannon found on a regular tank . ARVs may in some cases have electric generators , blowtorches , chainsaws and fuel pumps to help with recovery operations , or spare parts , to facilitate field repairs . Some ARVs have a spade component to anchor the vehicle when it is towing or lifting . Since most ARVs are based on tank or APC chassis , they have an armored crew cockpit and engine , which means that ARVs can be operated in combat conditions . Rarely , an ARV may be armed , such as some M32s , which have an 81 mm mortar for screening purposes , and the M88 , which has a .50 cal heavy machine gun . One WW II Sherman-based ARV had a dummy gun installed where the turret would normally go . Early ARVs in WW II were often repurposed tanks , with the turret and cannon removed and replaced with some type of winch . In the 2010s , ARVs are generally factory-built .",
