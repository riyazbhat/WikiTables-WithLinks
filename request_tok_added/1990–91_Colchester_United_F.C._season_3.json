  "/wiki/Part_exchange": "A part exchange or part exchange deal is a type of contract . In a part exchange , instead of one party to the contract paying money and the other party supplying goods/services , both parties supply goods/services , the first party supplying part money and part goods/services . Whether a part exchange is a sale or a barter is a fine point of law . It depends from whether a monetary value is assigned to the non-money goods supplied . Several cases at law clarify this . In the case of Flynn v Mackin and Mahon an old car was supplied in part exchange for a new car , along with \u00a3250 . This was held to be a barter , because no monetary value was affixed to the old car . However , in Aldridge v Johnson a similar transaction was held to be a sale , because a monetary value was assigned to the item being exchanged ( 23 bullocks , valued at \u00a3192 ) , and cash then used to make up the difference to the price of the item being purchased ( 100 quarters of barley , valued at \u00a3215 ) . If the contract had been structured as 23 bullocks and \u00a323 for 100 quarters of barley then it could have qualified as barter . It is the affixture of the monetary value of \u00a3192 to the bullocks and \u00a3215 to the barley that made it a sale . Indeed , it is not necessary even for the contracting parties themselves to assign a monetary value to the goods for a part exchange deal to be held to be a sale . In Bull v Parker , the court itself assigned a value ( \u00a34 ) for new riding equipment , sold for some old riding equipment and \u00a32 .",

It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north , Germany to the east , and France to the south . Its capital , Luxembourg City , is one of the four official capitals of the European Union ( together with Brussels , Frankfurt , and Strasbourg ) and the seat of the European Court of Justice , the highest judicial authority in the EU . Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish . The repeated invasions by Germany , especially in World War II , resulted in the country 's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and , among other things , led to the foundation of the European Union . With an area of 2,586 square kilometres ( 998 sq mi ) , it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe . In 2019 , Luxembourg had a population of 613,894 , which makes it one of the least-populous countries in Europe , but by far the one with the highest population growth rate . Foreigners account for nearly half of Luxembourg 's population . As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch , it is headed by Grand Duke Henri and is the world 's only remaining sovereign grand duchy . Luxembourg is a developed country , with an advanced economy and one of the world 's highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita . The City of Luxembourg with its old quarters and fortifications was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of the vast fortifications and the old city . The history of Luxembourg is considered to begin in 963 , when count Siegfried acquired a rocky promontory and its Roman-era fortifications known as Lucilinburhuc , little castle , and the surrounding area from the Imperial Abbey of St. Maximin in nearby Trier .",
