  "/wiki/Green_tinkerbird": "The green tinkerbird ( Pogoniulus simplex ) is a species of bird in the Lybiidae family ( African barbets ) . It is found in Kenya , Malawi , Mozambique , and Tanzania . The Eastern Green Tinkerbird , Pogoniulus simplex , ( Fischer & Reichenow , 1884 ) is a small , dull-green tinkerbird that has been included in a broadly-defined tinkerbird genus Pogoniulus ( Lafresnaye , 1842 ) by most recent authorities . The present paper , however , places simplex , and its relative leucomystax , the Moustached Green Tinkerbird , in the genus Viridibucco ( Oberholser , 1905 ) because the plumage patterns of these two species differ markedly from other tinkerbirds and there is an indication that they have a unique , hyper-specialized diet . Until recently , the Eastern Green Tinkerbird has been known from the southern African region only on the basis of a single skin from Chicomo , Funhalouro District , Inhambane Province , Mozambique ( Pinto 1959 , 1960 ; Clancey 1971 , 1996 ) . During the course of this investigation , a further overlooked locality for the species , the Gorongosa Massif , also came to light , as discussed further below . This paper documents the recent rediscovery of Eastern Green Tinkerbird in southern Africa and summarises information on selected uncommon or noteworthy species found in the coastal , dry , forest-thicket complex of the Sitila-Massinga district , Inhambane Province , Mozambique , by extracting records from the specimen database of the Durban Natural Science Museum , South Africa , and personal observations during two brief field-trips to Gaza and Inhambane provinces , Sul do Save , Mozambique . The term Sul do Save refers to Mozambique south of the Save River and comprising the provinces of Maputo , Gaza and Inhambane . This term is employed in preference to southern Mozambique , which in the ornithological literature , has come to have a vague meaning and is often applied to Mozambique south of the Zambezi River ( e.g . Clancey 1996 ) . A brief popular account of the rediscovery of the Eastern Green Tinkerbird in Sul do Save , Mozambique has been written ( Davies & Chittenden 2013 ) but fuller discussion and amplification of certain points is required . The original Eastern Green Tinkerbird skin from Sul do Save , was collected for the Museu Dr \u00c1lvaro de Castro ( Maputo Natural History Museum ; museum registration number 6184 ) near the village of Chicomo on 15 January 1958 by Rui Quadros ( 1937- 2010 ) , whom Pinto ( 1959 : 15 ) called an incans\u00e1vel colector ( tireless collector ) .",

They have a world-wide tropical distribution . The red-fronted tinkerbird is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in eastern South Africa , with a separate population from southern Sudan and Ethiopia south to central and eastern Tanzania . It is sometimes considered conspecific with its northern counterpart , the yellow-fronted tinkerbird , Pogoniulus chrysoconus . The red-fronted tinkerbird is associated with juniper forest and scrub . It nests in a tree hole and lays two or three eggs . It eats berries and fruit , particularly mistletoe , but also takes insects as it forages in deep cover . The red-fronted tinkerbird is in length . It is a plump bird , with a short neck , large head , and short tail . The adult has black upper parts heavily streaked with yellow and white , and a golden wing patch . Its head has a strong black and white pattern , with a red forecrown spot ."
