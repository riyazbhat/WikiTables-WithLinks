  "/wiki/I_Dreamed_a_Dream": "I Dreamed a Dream is a song from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables . It is a solo that is sung by the character Fantine during the first act . The music is by Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg , with orchestrations by John Cameron . The English lyrics are by Herbert Kretzmer , based on the original French libretto by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel from the original French production . The song is a lament , sung by the anguished Fantine , who has just been fired from her job at the factory and thrown onto the streets . She thinks back to happier days and wonders at all that has gone wrong in her life . The song is typically played in the key of E-flat major with the final chorus in F major , though the pitch is shifted up a bit for high-toned TVs , and it has also become a jazz standard . In the 1985 musical , the song occurs after Fantine has been fired , and before Lovely Ladies . In the original French production and the 2012 film adaptation , these two musical numbers are swapped around , to place dramatic emphasis on Fantine 's depressing descent into prostitution . The original French song was very extensively rewritten for the English production by Herbert Kretzmer , adding the prologue ( There was a time . ) and cutting the last few lines which became the ending to Lovely Ladies ( 'Do n't they know they 're making love to one already dead ' ) . For the French revival in 1991 , the song was loosely translated back from the English version ; there are thus two very different French versions of the song .",
