Rexs 1971 album Electric Warrior , with all songs written by Bolan , including the UK chart topper Get It On , has been described by AllMusic as the album that essentially kick-started the UK glam rock craze . Producer Tony Visconti , who would also work with the other major glam rock pioneer David Bowie , stated , What I saw in Marc Bolan had nothing to do with strings , or very high standards of artistry ; what I saw in him was raw talent . I saw genius . I saw a potential rock star in Marc - right from the minute , the hour I met him . Bolan died at the age of 29 in a car crash two weeks before his 30th birthday .
