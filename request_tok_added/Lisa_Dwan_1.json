  "/wiki/Samuel_Beckett": "Samuel Barclay Beckett ( /\u02c8b\u025bk\u026at/ ; 13 April 1906 - 22 December 1989 ) was an Irish novelist , playwright , short story writer , theatre director , poet , and literary translator . A resident of Paris for most of his adult life , he wrote in both French and English . Beckett 's work offers a bleak , tragi-comic outlook on human existence , often coupled with black comedy and gallows humour , and became increasingly minimalist in his later career . He is considered one of the last modernist writers , and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the Theatre of the Absurd . Beckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature for his writing , which - in new forms for the novel and drama - in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation . He was elected Saoi of Aosd\u00e1na in 1984 .",
