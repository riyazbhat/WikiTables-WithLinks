  "/wiki/Habsburg": "The House of Habsburg ( /\u02c8h\u00e6psb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ ; German : [ \u02c8ha\u02d0psb\u028a\u0281k ] ; alternatively spelled Hapsburg in English ) , also officially called the House of Austria ( Haus \u00d6sterreich in German , Casa de Austria in Spanish ) , was one of the most influential and distinguished royal houses of Europe . The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740 . The house also produced kings of Bohemia , Hungary , Croatia , Galicia , Portugal and Spain with their respective colonies , as well as rulers of several principalities in the Netherlands and Italy . From the 16th century , following the reign of Charles V , the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches . Although they ruled distinct territories , they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried . The House takes its name from Habsburg Castle , a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland , in the canton of Aargau , by Count Radbot of Klettgau , who named his fortress Habsburg . His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own , adding Count of Habsburg to his title . The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries . In 1273 , Count Radbot 's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg became Roman-German King . He moved the family 's power base to the Duchy of Austria , which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918 . A series of dynastic marriages enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy , Spain and its colonial empire , Bohemia , Hungary , and other territories . In the 16th century , the family separated into the senior Spanish and the junior Austrian branches , who settled their mutual claims in the O\u00f1ate treaty .",
  "/wiki/Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor": "Frederick III ( 21 September 1415 - 19 August 1493 ) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death . He was the first emperor of the House of Habsburg , and the fourth member of the House of Habsburg to be elected King of Germany after Rudolf I of Germany , Albert I in the 13th century and his predecessor Albert II of Germany . He was the penultimate emperor to be crowned by the Pope , and the last to be crowned in Rome . Prior to his imperial coronation , he was duke of the Inner Austrian lands of Styria , Carinthia and Carniola from 1424 , and also acted as regent over the Duchy of Austria ( as Frederick V ) from 1439 . He was elected and crowned King of Germany ( as Frederick IV ) in 1440 . He was the longest-reigning German monarch when in 1493 , after ruling his domains for more than 53 years , he was succeeded by his son Maximilian I . During his reign , Frederick concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg hereditary lands of Austria and took a lesser interest in Imperial affairs . Nevertheless , by his dynastic entitlement to Hungary as well as by the Burgundian inheritance , he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire . Mocked as Arch-Sleepyhead of the Holy Roman Empire ( ) during his lifetime , he is today increasingly seen as an effective ruler .",
  "/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor": "Maximilian I ( 22 March 1459 - 12 January 1519 ) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1508 until his death . He was never crowned by the pope , as the journey to Rome was always too risky . He was instead proclaimed emperor elect by Pope Julius II at Trent , thus breaking the long tradition of requiring a papal coronation for the adoption of the imperial title . Maximilian was the son of Frederick III , Holy Roman Emperor , and Eleanor of Portugal . He ruled jointly with his father for the last ten years of the latter 's reign , from to his father 's death in 1493 . Maximilian expanded the influence of the House of Habsburg through war and his marriage in 1477 to Mary of Burgundy , the heiress to the Duchy of Burgundy , though he also lost the Austrian territories in today 's Switzerland to the Swiss Confederacy . Through marriage of his son Philip the Handsome to eventual queen Joanna of Castile in 1498 , Maximilian helped to establish the Habsburg dynasty in Spain , which allowed his grandson Charles to hold the thrones of both Castile and Aragon .",
  "/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor": "Charles V ( 24 February 1500 - 21 September 1558 ) was Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria from 1519 , King of Spain ( Castile and Aragon , as Charles I ) from 1516 , and Lord of the Netherlands as titular Duke of Burgundy from 1506 . Head of the rising House of Habsburg during the first half of the 16th century , his dominions in Europe included the Holy Roman Empire extending from Germany to northern Italy with direct rule over the Austrian hereditary lands and the Burgundian Low Countries , and a unified Spain with its southern Italian kingdoms of Naples , Sicily , and Sardinia . Furthermore , his reign encompassed both the long-lasting Spanish and short-lived German colonizations of the Americas . The personal union of the European and American territories of Charles V was the first collection of realms labelled the empire on which the sun never sets . Born in Flanders to Philip the Handsome of the Austrian House of Habsburg ( son of Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor and Mary of Burgundy ) and Joanna the Mad of the Spanish House of Trast\u00e1mara ( daughter of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon ) , Charles inherited all of his family dominions at a young age due to the premature death of his father and the mental illness of his mother . After the death of Philip in 1506 , he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands originally held by his paternal grandmother Mary . In 1516 , he became co-monarch of Spain with his mother Joanna and as such he was the first king of Spain to inherit the country as dynastically unified by the Catholic Monarchs , his maternal grandparents . The Spanish possessions at his accession also included the Castilian West Indies and the Aragonese Kingdoms of Naples , Sicily and Sardinia . At the death of his paternal grandfather Maximilian in 1519 , he inherited Austria and was elected to succeed him as Holy Roman Emperor . He adopted the Imperial name of Charles V as his main title , and styled himself as a new Charlemagne . Charles V revitalized the medieval concept of the universal monarchy and spent most of his life defending the integrity of the Holy Roman Empire from the Protestant Reformation , the expansion of the Ottoman Empire , and a series of wars with France . He made 40 journeys , travelling from country to country with no single fixed capital city , and it is estimated that he spent a quarter of his reign on the road .",

Before his accession , he ruled the Austrian hereditary lands of the Habsburgs in the name of his elder brother , Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor . Also , he often served as Charles ' representative in Germany and developed encouraging relationships with German princes . The key events during his reign were the contest with the Ottoman Empire , which in the 1520s began a great advance into Central Europe , and the Protestant Reformation , which resulted in several wars of religion . Ferdinand was able to defend his realm and make it somewhat more cohesive , but he could not conquer the major part of Hungary . His flexible approach to Imperial problems , mainly religious , finally brought more result than the more confrontational attitude of his brother . Ferdinand 's motto was : Let justice be done , though the world perish .",

On 8 September 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia in the Hungarian capital Pressburg ( Pozsony in Hungarian ; now Bratislava , Slovakia ) . On 25 July 1564 he succeeded his father Ferdinand I as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire . Maximilian 's rule was shaped by the confessionalization process after the 1555 Peace of Augsburg . Though a Habsburg and a Catholic , he approached the Lutheran Imperial estates with a view to overcome the denominational schism , which ultimately failed . He also was faced with the ongoing Ottoman-Habsburg wars and rising conflicts with his Habsburg Spain cousins . According to Fichtner , Maximilian failed to achieve his three major aims : rationalizing the government structure , unifying Christianity , and evicting the Turks from Hungary .",

He was a member of the House of Habsburg . Rudolf 's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways : an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the Thirty Years ' War ; a great and influential patron of Northern Mannerist art ; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the scientific revolution .",

He was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria , and Maria of Bavaria . In 1590 , his parents , who were devout Catholics , sent him to study at the Jesuits ' college in Ingolstadt , because they wanted to isolate him from the Lutheran nobles . In the same year , he inherited Inner AustriaStyria , Carinthia , Carniola and smaller provincesfrom his father . Rudolf II , Holy Roman Emperor , who was the head of the Habsburg family , appointed regents to administer Inner Austria on behalf of the minor Ferdinand . Ferdinand was installed as the actual ruler of the Inner Austrian provinces in 1596 and 1597 . Rudolph II also charged him with the command of the defense of Croatia , Slavonia and southeastern Hungary against the Ottoman Empire . He regarded the regulation of religious issues as a royal prerogative and introduced strict Counter-Reformation measures from 1598 . First , he ordered the expulsion of all Protestant pastors and teachers , then he established special commissions to restore the Catholic parishes . The Ottomans captured Nagykanizsa in Hungary in 1600 , which enabled them to invade Styria . A year later , Ferdinand tried to recapture the fortress , but the action ended with a defeat due to the unprofessional command of his troops in November 1601 . During the first stage of the family feud known as the Brothers ' Quarrel , Ferdinand initially supported Rudolph II 's brother , Matthias , who wanted to convince the melancholic Emperor to abdicate , but Matthias ' concessions to the Protestants in Hungary , Austria and Bohemia outraged him .",

At a young age , Ferdinand IV took his father 's role as Archduke of Austria . In 1646 , Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia as he shared the role with his father Emperor Ferdinand III .

Ferdinand IV also shared the role as King of Hungary and Croatia with his father ; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg , present-day Slovakia . After the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans , Emperor Ferdinand III made an opportunity of a recent decline in the prestige of France , and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans , and de facto heir to the Holy Roman Empire . He was crowned in Ratisbon ( Regensburg , present-day south-east Germany ) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653 .

Elected in 1658 , Leopold ruled the Holy Roman Empire until his death in 1705 , becoming the longest-ruling Habsburg emperor ( at 46 years and 9 months ) . Leopold 's reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the east and rivalry with Louis XIV , a contemporary and first cousin , in the west . After more than a decade of warfare , Leopold emerged victorious from the Great Turkish War thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy . By the Treaty of Karlowitz , Leopold recovered almost all of the Kingdom of Hungary , which had fallen under Turkish power in the years after the 1526 Battle of Moh\u00e1cs . Leopold fought three wars against France : the Franco-Dutch War , the Nine Years ' War , and the War of the Spanish Succession . In this last , Leopold sought to give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance , disregarding the will of the late Charles II . Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe . The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria , with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim , but the war would drag on until 1714 , nine years after Leopold 's death , which barely had an effect on the warring nations . When peace returned , Austria could not be said to have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks .",

He succeeded to the thrones of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire when his father died . Joseph continued the War of the Spanish Succession , begun by his father against Louis XIV of France , in a fruitless attempt to make his younger brother Charles ( later Emperor Charles VI ) King of Spain . In the process , however , owing to the victories won by his military commander , Prince Eugene of Savoy , he did succeed in establishing Austrian hegemony over Italy . Joseph also had to contend with a protracted revolt in Hungary , fomented by Louis XIV . Neither conflict was resolved until the Treaty of Utrecht , after his death .

In total , Great Britain , France , Saxony-Poland , the Dutch Republic , Spain , Venice , States of the Church , Prussia , Russia , Denmark , Savoy-Sardinia , Bavaria , and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction . France , Spain , Saxony-Poland , Bavaria and Prussia later reneged .
