  "/wiki/Douglas_DC-3": "The Douglas DC-3 is a propeller-driven airliner which had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s/1940s and World War II . It was developed as a larger , improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2 . It is a low-wing metal monoplane with a tailwheel landing gear , powered by two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial piston engines . It has a cruise speed of 207 mph ( 333 km/h ) , capacity of 21 to 32 passengers or 6,000 lbs ( 2,700 kg ) of cargo , a range of 1,500 mi ( 2,400 km ) , and could operate from short runways . Before the war , it pioneered many air travel routes as it could cross the continental US and made worldwide flights possible , carried passengers in greater comfort , and was reliable and easy to maintain . It is considered the first airliner that could profitably carry only passengers . Following the war , the airliner market was flooded with surplus military transport aircraft , and the DC-3 could not be upgraded by Douglas due to cost . It was made obsolete on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation , but the design proved adaptable and useful . Civil DC-3 production ended in 1942 at 607 aircraft . Military versions , including the C-47 Skytrain ( the Dakota in British RAF service ) , and Soviet- and Japanese-built versions , brought total production to over 16,000 . Many continue to see service in a variety of niche roles : 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were estimated to be still flying in 2013 . [ contradictory ]",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand_National_Airways_Corporation_Flight_441": "New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441 ( NZ441 ) was a scheduled flight of the New Zealand National Airways Corporation from Whenuapai , Auckland to Tauranga . On 3 July 1963 at approximately 9:09 am NZST the flight , a Douglas DC-3 Skyliner , flew into a vertical rock face in the Kaimai Ranges near Mount Ngatamahinerua , at an altitude of 2460 feet ( 750 m ) . Twenty three people were on board . Twenty two were killed instantly ; there is evidence that one person survived the impact but died shortly afterward . Three extra passengers were supposed to be on the flight , but changed their plans at the last minute . According to Civil Aviation Authority investigators , a downdraft carried the aircraft below the level of the crests of the range , where under the very poor weather conditions prevailing at the time , the aircraft encountered an area of extreme turbulence from which it was impossible for the crew to recover altitude . On the day of the crash , another plane was caught in strong downdrafts in the Kaimai Ranges but managed to recover . Furthermore , the crew was probably unaware of the true position of the aircraft and initiated a premature descent . However , it must be appreciated that the crew decided to descend only to the level officially designated as the minimum safe altitude in the area of the descent . Following this accident , the Civil Aviation Authority made the decision to classify the Kaimai Ranges as mountainous terrain , which raised the minimum safe altitude for the area by 1000 feet ( 305 m ) . Due to the remoteness of the crash , the wreckage was not recovered but secured on site by the New Zealand Army in 1964 . This is similar to New Zealand 's other major air disaster , Air New Zealand Flight 901 , which remains on the slopes of Mount Erebus in Antarctica where it crashed .",

  "/wiki/Piper_Cherokee": "The Piper PA-28 Cherokee is a family of two-seat or four-seat light aircraft built by Piper Aircraft and designed for flight training , air taxi and personal use . The PA-28 family of aircraft comprises all-metal , unpressurized , single-engined , piston-powered airplanes with low-mounted wings and tricycle landing gear . They have a single door on the right side , which is entered by stepping on the wing . The first PA-28 received its type certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration in 1960 and the series remains in production to this day . Current models are the Warrior , Arrow , Archer TX and LX , and Pilot 100 and i100 . The Archer was discontinued in 2009 , but with investment from new company ownership , the model was put back into production in 2010 . The PA-28 series competes with the high-winged Cessna 172 and the similarly low-winged Grumman American AA-5 series and Beechcraft Musketeer designs . Piper has created variations within the Cherokee family by installing engines ranging from 140 to 300 hp ( 105-220 kW ) , offering turbocharging , retractable landing gear , constant-speed propeller and stretching the fuselage to accommodate six people . The Piper PA-32 ( initially known as Cherokee Six ) is a larger , six-seat variant of the PA-28 . The PA-32R Saratoga variant was in production until 2009 .",

  "/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10": "The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is an American three-engine wide-body jet airliner manufactured by McDonnell Douglas . It has two turbofan engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer . The DC-10 was intended as a successor to the company 's DC-8 for medium- to long range flights , using a larger capacity wide-body layout with seating up to 380 and more powerful engines . Lockheed also saw this niche as an ideal place to reenter the commercial airliner market with their very similar L-1011 TriStar . Although the L-1011 was more technologically advanced , the DC-10 would go on to outsell the L-1011 by a significant margin due to the DC-10 's lower price and earlier entry into the market . The initial DC-10-10 model was a domestic design with a typical range on the order of 3,800 miles ( 6,100 km ) in a two-class layout . The -15 was a version with more powerful engines , for hotter or higher-altitude airports . The -30 and -40 models were the international versions with extended range of up to 6,220 miles ( 10,010 km ) and a third main landing gear leg to support the higher takeoff weights . An even longer-range version proposed for British Airways , the -50 , was not built . The KC-10 Extender air-to-air refueling tanker version , was based on the -30 model . Production of the DC-10 ended in 1989 , with 386 DC-10s delivered to airlines and 60 KC-10s to the U.S. Air Force . The DC-10 had a poor safety record in early operations , especially due to a design flaw in the cargo doors .",
  "/wiki/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901": "The Mount Erebus disaster occurred on 28 November 1979 when Air New Zealand Flight 901 ( TE-901 ) [ nb 1 ] flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island , Antarctica , killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board . Scheduled Air New Zealand Antarctic sightseeing flight had been operating between 1977 and 1979 . This flight was supposed to leave Auckland Airport in the morning and spend a few hours flying over the Antarctic continent , before returning to Auckland in the evening via Christchurch . The initial investigation concluded the accident was caused by pilot error , but public outcry led to the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the crash . The commission , presided over by Justice Peter Mahon QC , concluded that the accident was caused by a correction made to the coordinates of the flight path the night before the disaster , coupled with a failure to inform the flight crew of the change , with the result that the aircraft , instead of being directed by computer down McMurdo Sound ( as the crew had been led to believe ) , was instead re-routed to a path toward Mount Erebus . Justice Mahon 's report accused Air New Zealand of presenting an orchestrated litany of lies and this led to changes in senior management at the airline . The Privy Council later ruled that the finding of a conspiracy was a breach of natural justice and not supported by the evidence . The accident is New Zealand 's deadliest peacetime disaster , as well as the deadliest accident in the history of Air New Zealand .",

  "/wiki/2012_Carterton_hot_air_balloon_crash": "On 7 January 2012 , a scenic hot air balloon flight from Carterton , New Zealand , collided with a high-voltage power line while attempting to land , causing it to catch fire , disintegrate and crash just north of the town , killing all eleven people on board . An inquiry into the accident by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( TAIC ) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent , trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below . Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot , Lance Hopping , after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , suggesting he may have been under the influence of cannabis at the time of the crash , which ultimately led to the error in judgement . The crash was the sixth transport accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol , and the commission has called for the government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation , marine and rail industries . The crash is the deadliest ballooning disaster ever occurred in New Zealand . It was also the deadliest air disaster to occur in mainland New Zealand since the 1963 crash of New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441 , and the deadliest crash involving a New Zealand aircraft since 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 into Mount Erebus ."
