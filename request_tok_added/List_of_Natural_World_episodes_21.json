  "/wiki/Nile_crocodile": "The Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ) is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa , where it is present in 26 countries . Due to its widespread occurrence and stable population trend , it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996 . It is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa , occurring mostly in the central , eastern , and southern regions of the continent , and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes , rivers , and marshlands . Although capable of living in saline environments , this species is rarely found in saltwater , but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes . The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile , as far north as the Nile delta . On average , the adult male Nile crocodile is between in length and weighs . However , specimens exceeding in length and weighing up to have been recorded . It is the largest freshwater predator in Africa , and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile and in the world , after the saltwater crocodile ( Crocodylus porosus ) . Sexual dimorphism is prevalent , and females are usually about 30% smaller than males . They have thick , scaly , heavily armored skin . Nile crocodiles are opportunistic apex predators ; a very aggressive species of crocodile , they are capable of taking almost any animal within their range . They are generalists , taking a variety of prey .",

  "/wiki/Great_white_shark": "The great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) , also known as the great white , white shark or white pointer , is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans . The great white shark is notable for its size , with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m ( 20 ft ) in length and 1,905-2,268 kg ( 4,200-5,000 lb ) in weight at maturity . However , most are smaller ; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m ( 11 to 13 ft ) , and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m ( 15 to 16 ft ) on average . According to a 2014 study , the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more , well above previous estimates , making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known . According to the same study , male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity , while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring . Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h ( 35 mph ) , and can swim to depths of 1,200 m ( 3,900 ft ) . The great white shark has no known natural predators other than , on very rare occasions , the killer whale . The great white shark is arguably the world 's largest known extant macropredatory fish , and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals , up to the size of large baleen whales . It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals , including fish , and seabirds . It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon , and is responsible for more recorded human bite incidents than any other shark . The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection . The IUCN lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species , and it is included in Appendix II of CITES .",
  "/wiki/Elephant_seal": "Elephant seals are large , oceangoing earless seals in the genus Mirounga . The two species , the northern elephant seal ( M. angustirostris ) and the southern elephant seal ( M. leonina ) , were both hunted to the brink of extinction by the end of the 19th century , but their numbers have since recovered . The northern elephant seal , somewhat smaller than its southern relative , ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S. , Canada and Mexico . The most northerly breeding location on the Pacific Coast is at Race Rocks , at the southern tip of Vancouver Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca . The southern elephant seal is found in the Southern Hemisphere on islands such as South Georgia and Macquarie Island , and on the coasts of New Zealand , South Africa , and Argentina in the Peninsula Vald\u00e9s . In southern Chile , there is a small colony of 120 animals at Jackson Bay , Admiralty Sound ( Seno Almirantazgo ) , Tierra del Fuego . The oldest known unambiguous elephant seal fossils are fragmentary fossils of an unnamed member of the tribe Miroungini described from the late Pliocene Petane Formation of New Zealand . Teeth originally identified as representing an unnamed species of Mirounga have been found in South Africa , and dated to the Miocene epoch ; however Boessenecker & Churchill ( 2016 ) considered these teeth to be almost certainly misidentified odontocete teeth . Elephant seals breed annually and are seemingly faithful to colonies that have established breeding areas .",

  "/wiki/Barn_owl": "The barn owl ( Tyto alba ) is the most widely distributed species of owl and one of the most widespread of all birds . It is also referred to as the common barn owl , to distinguish it from other species in its family , Tytonidae , which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls , the other being the typical owls ( Strigidae ) . The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions , in Asia north of the Himalaya , most of Indonesia , and some Pacific islands . Phylogenetic evidence shows that there are at least three major lineages of barn owl , one in Europe , western Asia and Africa , one in southeast Asia and Australasia , and one in the Americas , and some highly divergent taxa on islands . Accordingly , some authorities split the group into the western barn owl for the group in Europe , western Asia and Africa , the American barn owl for the group in the Americas , and the eastern barn owl for the group in southeast Asia and Australasia . Some taxonomic authorities further split the group , recognising up to five species , and further research needs to be done to clarify the position . There is a considerable variation between the sizes and colour of the approximately 28 subspecies but most are between in length with wingspans ranging from . The plumage on head and back is a mottled shade of grey or brown , the underparts vary from white to brown and are sometimes speckled with dark markings . The face is characteristically heart-shaped and is white in most subspecies . This owl does not hoot , but utters an eerie , drawn-out shriek . The barn owl is nocturnal over most of its range , but in Britain and some Pacific islands , it also hunts by day . Barn owls specialise in hunting animals on the ground and nearly all of their food consists of small mammals which they locate by sound , their hearing being very acute .",
  "/wiki/Little_owl": "The little owl ( Athene noctua ) is a bird that inhabits much of the temperate and warmer parts of Europe , Asia east to Korea , and north Africa . It was introduced into Britain at the end of the nineteenth century and into the South Island of New Zealand in the early twentieth century . This owl is a member of the typical or true owl family , Strigidae , which contains most species of owl , the other grouping being the barn owls , Tytonidae . It is a small , cryptically coloured , mainly nocturnal species and is found in a range of habitats including farmland , woodland fringes , steppes and semi-deserts . It feeds on insects , earthworms , other invertebrates and small vertebrates . Males hold territories which they defend against intruders . This owl is a cavity nester and a clutch of about four eggs is laid in spring . The female does the incubation and the male brings food to the nest , first for the female and later for the newly hatched young . As the chicks grow , both parents hunt and bring them food , and the chicks leave the nest at about seven weeks of age . Being a common species with a wide range and large total population , the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as least concern .",
  "/wiki/Long-eared_owl": "The long-eared owl ( Asio otus ) , also known as the northern long-eared owl or , more informally , as the lesser horned owl or cat owl , is a medium-sized species of owl with an extensive breeding range . The scientific name is from Latin . The genus name Asio is a type of eared owl , and otus also refers to a small , eared owl . The species breeds in many areas through Europe and Asia , as well as in North America . This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls , of the family Strigidae , which contains most extant species of owl ( while the other taxonomic family of owls are the barn owls , or Tytonidae ) . This owl shows a partiality for semi-open habitats , particularly woodland edge , as they prefer to roost and nest within dense stands of wood but prefer to hunt over open ground . The long-eared owl is a somewhat specialized predator , focusing its diet almost entirely on small rodents , especially voles , which quite often comprise most of their diet . Under some circumstances , such as population cycles of their regular prey , arid or insular regional habitats or urbanization , this species can adapt fairly well to a diversity of prey , including birds and insects . All owls do not build their own nests . In the case of the long-eared owl , the owls generally utilizes nests that are built by other animals , with a partiality in many regions for those built by corvids . Breeding success in this species is largely correlated with prey populations and predation risks . Unlike many owls , long-eared owls are not strongly territorial nor sedentary .",

  "/wiki/Tawny_owl": "The tawny owl or brown owl ( Strix aluco ) is a stocky , medium-sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia . Its underparts are pale with dark streaks , and the upperparts are either brown or grey . Several of the eleven recognised subspecies have both variants . The nest is typically in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators . This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial . Many young birds starve if they can not find a vacant territory once parental care ceases . This nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents , usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey , which it swallows whole ; in more urban areas its diet includes a higher proportion of birds . Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting . The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls , but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk . Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision , its retina is no more sensitive than a human 's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing . Its nocturnal habits and eerie , easily imitated call , have led to a mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death .",

The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists .

With a typical head-to-body length of 184-208 cm ( 72-82 in ) they are larger than females at 160-184 cm ( 63-72 in ) . It is a social species , forming groups called prides . A lion pride consists of a few adult males , related females and cubs . Groups of female lions usually hunt together , preying mostly on large ungulates . The lion is an apex and keystone predator , although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur , and have been known to hunt humans , although the species typically does not . Typically , the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests . It is usually more diurnal than other big cats , but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight . In the Pleistocene , the lion ranged throughout Eurasia , Africa and North America but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India . It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s .

Moose are distinguished by the broad , palmate ( open-hand shaped ) antlers of the males ; other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic ( twig-like ) configuration . It typically inhabits boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates . Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose 's range over time . It has been reintroduced to some of its former habitats . Currently , most moose are found in Canada , Alaska , New England ( with Maine having the most of the lower 48 states ) , Fennoscandia , Baltic states , and Russia . Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation . The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans . Unlike most other deer species , moose do not form herds and are solitary animals , aside from calves who remain with their mother until the cow begins estrus ( typically at 18 months after birth of the calf ) , at which point the cow chases away young bulls . Although generally slow-moving and sedentary , moose can become aggressive and move quickly if angered or startled . Their mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males competing for a female .",

The documentary shows Attenborough searching for the identities of preserved creatures inside a piece of Baltic amber that was given to him by his adoptive sister when he was twelve years old . It then shows how a group of scientists can reconstruct an entire twenty million-year-old ecosystem through pieces of Dominican amber . Examples include a tadpole preserved in amber after falling from a bromeliad . Attenborough then discusses the scientific feasibility of DNA being preserved in amber , and the science behind the 1993 hit techno-thriller Jurassic Park , in which his elder brother Richard Attenborough starred as John Hammond . Several attempts were tried , with DNA eventually being recovered from a weevil that was several million years older than Tyrannosaurus rex .

  "/wiki/Bee": "Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants , known for their role in pollination and , in the case of the best-known bee species , the western honey bee , for producing honey and beeswax . Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade , called Anthophila . There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families . They are found on every continent except Antarctica , in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants . Some species - including honey bees , bumblebees , and stingless bees - live socially in colonies . Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen , the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients . Most pollen is used as food for larvae . Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially . The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees . Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0.08 in ) long , to Megachile pluto , the largest species of leafcutter bee , whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1.54 in ) .

Common names include greenfly and blackfly , although individuals within a species can vary widely in colour . The group includes the fluffy white woolly aphids . A typical life cycle involves flightless females giving living birth to female nymphs without the involvement of males . Maturing rapidly , females breed profusely so that the number of these insects multiplies quickly . Winged females may develop later in the season , allowing the insects to colonise new plants . In temperate regions , a phase of sexual reproduction occurs in the autumn , with the insects often overwintering as eggs . The life cycle of some species involves an alternation between two species of host plants , for example between an annual crop and a woody plant . Some species feed on only one type of plant , while others are generalists , colonising many plant groups . About 5,000 species of aphid have been described , all included in the family Aphididae . Around 400 of these are found on food and fibre crops , and many are serious pests of agriculture and forestry , as well as an annoyance for gardeners .

Ants appear suddenly across the globe during the earliest part of the Late Cretaceous , but are already considerably diversified by this time , suggesting an earlier origin . Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified . They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists . Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile , wingless females , most of which are workers ( ergates ) , as well as soldiers ( dinergates ) and other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones ( aner ) and one or more fertile females called queens ( gynes ) . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .",

Though spectacular exceptions are known , most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable ; they have a relatively narrow neck , sturdy build , and formidable curved proboscis ( sometimes called a rostrum ) . Large specimens should be handled with caution , if at all , because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis .",
  "/wiki/Tadpole": "A tadpole ( also called a pollywog ) is the larval stage in the life cycle of an amphibian , particularly that of a frog or toad . They are usually wholly aquatic , though some species have tadpoles that are terrestrial . When first hatched from the egg they have a more or less globular body , a laterally compressed tail and internal or external gills . As they grow they undergo metamorphosis , during which process they grow limbs , develop lungs and reabsorb the tail . Most tadpoles are herbivorous and during metamorphosis the mouth and internal organs are rearranged to prepare for an adult carnivorous lifestyle . Having no hard parts , it might be expected that fossil tadpoles would not exist . However , traces of biofilms have been preserved and fossil tadpoles have been found dating back to the Miocene . Tadpoles are eaten in some parts of the world and are mentioned in folk tales and used as a symbol in ancient Egyptian numerals .",

They occur in virtually any freshwater habitat around the world , but a few species live among leaf litter . The adults of most are between long , though much variation is seen between species . The European Dytiscus latissimus and Brazilian Megadytes ducalis are the largest , reaching up to and respectively . In contrast , the smallest is likely the Australian Limbodessus atypicali of subterranean waters , which only is about long . Most are dark brown , blackish , or dark olive in color with golden highlights in some subfamilies . The larvae are commonly known as water tigers due to their voracious appetite . They have short , but sharp mandibles and immediately upon biting , they deliver digestive enzymes into prey to suck their liquefied remains . The family includes more than 4,000 described species in numerous genera .",
  "/wiki/Poison_dart_frog": "Poison dart frog ( also known as dart-poison frog , poison frog or formerly known as poison arrow frog ) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America . These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies . This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species , making them aposematic . Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity , while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity . The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants , mites and termites . Other species however , that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity , eat a much larger variety of prey . Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit . These amphibians are often called dart frogs due to the Amerindians ' indigenous use of their to poison the tips of blowdarts . However , of over 170 species , only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ) , all of which come from the genus Phyllobates , which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members .",

  "/wiki/Damselfly": "Damselflies are insects of the suborder Zygoptera in the order Odonata . They are similar to dragonflies , which constitute the other odonatan suborder , Anisoptera , but are smaller , have slimmer bodies , and most species fold the wings along the body when at rest , unlike dragonflies which hold the wings flat and away from the body . An ancient group , damselflies have existed since at least the Lower Permian , and are found on every continent except Antarctica . All damselflies are predatory ; both nymphs and adults eat other insects . The nymphs are aquatic , with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acid bogs , ponds , lakes and rivers . The nymphs moult repeatedly , at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo metamorphosis . The skin splits down the back , they emerge and inflate their wings and abdomen to gain their adult form . Their presence on a body of water indicates that it is relatively unpolluted , but their dependence on freshwater makes them vulnerable to damage to their wetland habitats . Some species of damselfly have elaborate courtship behaviours . Many species are sexually dimorphic , the males often being more brightly coloured than the females . Like dragonflies , they reproduce using indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation . A mating pair form a shape known as a heart or wheel , the male clasping the female at the back of the head , the female curling her abdomen down to pick up sperm from secondary genitalia at the base of the male 's abdomen .",
  "/wiki/Bamboo": "Bamboos /b\u00e6m\u02c8bu\u02d0/ ( listen ) are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae . The word bamboo comes from the Dutch or Portuguese languages , which probably borrowed it from Malay . In bamboo , as in other grasses , the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement . The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent . The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots , including the palms and large bamboos , to be columnar rather than tapering . Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world , due to a unique rhizome-dependent system . Certain species of bamboo can grow 910 mm ( 36 in ) within a 24-hour period , at a rate of almost 40 mm ( 1.6 in ) an hour ( a growth around 1 mm every 90 seconds , or 1 inch every 40 minutes ) . Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family . Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia , Southeast Asia and East Asia , being used for building materials , as a food source , and as a versatile raw product . Bamboo , like wood , is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures . Bamboo 's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to timber , and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber .",

  "/wiki/Nematode": "The nematodes ( , ; ) or roundworms constitute the phylum Nematoda ( also called Nemathelminthes ) . They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments . Taxonomically , they are classified along with insects and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa , and unlike flatworms , have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends . Like tardigrades they have a reduced number of Hox genes , but as their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox genotype , it shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum . Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another . Consequently , estimates of the number of nematode species described to date vary by author and may change rapidly over time . A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal Zootaxa puts this figure at over 25,000 . Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation . A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode , a claim which has since been repeated in numerous publications , without additional investigation , in an attempt to accentuate the importance and ubiquity of nematodes in the global ecosystem ( rather than as a sign of agreement with the estimated taxonomic figure ) . Many other publications have since vigorously refuted this claim on the grounds that it is unsupported by fact , and is the result of speculation and sensationalism . More recent , fact-based estimates have placed the true figure closer to 40,000 species worldwide . Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem : from marine ( salt ) to fresh water , soils , from the polar regions to the tropics , as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations .",

The saber-toothed cats , both living and extinct , have been found almost worldwide from the Eocene epoch to the end of the Pleistocene epoch 42 million years ago ( mya ) - 11,000 years ago ( kya ) . The first saber-toothed cat fossil in Canada was found in Medicine Hat , Alberta . One of the best-known genera is Smilodon , species of which , especially S. fatalis , are popularly , but incorrectly , referred as a saber-toothed tiger . However , usage of the word cat is in some cases a misnomer , as many species referred to as saber-toothed cats are not closely related to modern cats ( Felidae ) . Instead , many are members are classified into different families of Feliformia , such as Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae ; the oxyaenid creodont genera Machaeroides and Apataelurus ; and two extinct lineages of metatherian mammals , the thylacosmilids of Sparassodonta , and deltatheroideans , which are more closely related to marsupials . In this regard , saber-toothed cats can be viewed as examples of convergent evolution . This convergence is remarkable due not only to the development of elongated canines , but also a suite of other characteristics , such as a wide gape and bulky forelimbs , which is so consistent that it has been termed the saber-tooth suite . Of the feliform lineages , the family Nimravidae is the oldest , entering the landscape around 42 mya and becoming extinct by 7.2 mya .

The sites range in elevation from sea level to . Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42\u00b0N latitude ; there have been only five unconfirmed reports above this latitude . This range restriction is thought to be due to temperature , prey , or habitat limitations imposed by proximity to the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that existed at the time .
