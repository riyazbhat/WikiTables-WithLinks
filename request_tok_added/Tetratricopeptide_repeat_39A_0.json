  "/wiki/Homo_sapiens": "Homo sapiens is the only extant human species . The name is Latin for 'wise man ' and was introduced in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus ( who is himself the lectotype for the species ) . Extinct species of the genus Homo include Homo erectus , extant from roughly 1.9 to 0.4 million years ago , and a number of other species ( by some authors considered subspecies of either H. sapiens or H. erectus ) . The divergence of the lineage leading to H. sapiens out of ancestral H. erectus ( or an intermediate species such as Homo antecessor ) is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago . The earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appears in Africa around 300,000 years ago , with the earliest genetic splits among modern people , according to some evidence , dating to around the same time . [ note 1 ] Sustained archaic admixture is known to have taken place both in Africa and ( following the recent Out-Of-Africa expansion ) in Eurasia , between about 100,000 and 30,000 years ago . The term anatomically modern humans ( AMH ) is used to distinguish H. sapiens having an anatomy consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in contemporary humans from varieties of extinct archaic humans . This is useful especially for times and regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed , for example , in Paleolithic Europe . Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) .",
  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",
  "/wiki/Mus_musculus": "The house mouse ( Mus musculus ) is a small mammal of the order Rodentia , characteristically having a pointed snout , large rounded ears , and a long and hairy tail . It is one of the most abundant species of the genus Mus . Although a wild animal , the house mouse has benefited significantly from associating with human habitation to the point that truly wild populations are significantly less common than the semi-tame populations near human activity . The house mouse has been domesticated as the pet or fancy mouse , and as the laboratory mouse , which is one of the most important model organisms in biology and medicine . The complete mouse reference genome was sequenced in 2002 .",
  "/wiki/Mouse": "A mouse , plural mice , is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout , small rounded ears , a body-length scaly tail , and a high breeding rate . The best known mouse species is the common house mouse ( Mus musculus ) . It is also a popular pet . In some places , certain kinds of field mice are locally common . They are known to invade homes for food and shelter . Species of mice are mostly classified in Rodentia , and are present throughout the order . Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus . Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size . Generally , when someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent , its common name includes the term mouse , while if it is larger , the name includes the term rat . Common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific . Scientifically , the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus for example , but includes such as the deer mouse , Peromyscus . Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse .",

There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl . Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food ( consuming both their meat and eggs ) and , less commonly , as pets . Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies , chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period ( 4th-2nd centuries BC ) . Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia , Southeast Asia , and East Asia , but with the clade found in the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent . From ancient India , the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor , and to Greece by the 5th century BC . Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC , with the bird that gives birth every day having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar , Babylonia , according to the annals of Thutmose III .",

  "/wiki/Branchiostoma_floridae": "Branchiostoma floridae ( the Florida lancelet ) is a lancelet of the genus Branchiostoma . The genome of this species has been sequenced , revealing that among the chordates , the morphologically simpler tunicates are actually more closely related to vertebrates than lancelets . An embryo of a Florida amphioxus ( Branchiostoma floridae ) has a larval pharynx with gill slits that is asymmetrical . The gill slits in the larval pharynx form in the center of the embryo when it is in its earliest stage of development ( primordial ) meaning the thick layer of endoderm is overlapped by a thin layer ; which aids into making the B. floridae asymmetrical from left to right .",
  "/wiki/Lancelet": "The lancelets , also known as amphioxi ( singular , amphioxus ) , consist of about 30-35 species of fish-like benthic filter feeding chordates in the order Amphioxiformes . They are the modern representatives of the subphylum Cephalochordata . Lancelets closely resemble , and are believed to be related to , 530-million-year-old Pikaia , fossils of which are known from the Burgess Shale . Zoologists are interested in them because they provide evolutionary insight into the origins of vertebrates . Lancelets contain many organs and organ systems that are closely related to those of modern fish , but in more primitive form . Therefore , they provide a number of examples of possible evolution exaptation . For example , the gill-slits of lancelets are used for feeding only , and not for respiration . The circulatory system carries food throughout their body , but does not have red blood cells or hemoglobin for transporting oxygen . Lancelet genomes hold clues about the early evolution of vertebrates , by comparing genes from lancelets with the same genes in vetebrates , the change in gene function as vetebrates evolved can be discovered . The genome of a few species in the genus Branchiostoma have been sequenced : B. floridae , B. belcheri , B. lanceolatum . In Asia , lancelets are harvested commercially as food for humans and as domesticated animals . In Japan , amphioxus ( B. belcheri ) has been listed in the registry of Endangered Animals of Japanese Marine and Fresh Water Organisms .",
  "/wiki/Physcomitrella_patens": "Physcomitrella patens , the spreading earthmoss , is a moss ( bryophyte ) used as a model organism for studies on plant evolution , development , and physiology .",
  "/wiki/Moss": "Mosses are small flowerless plants that typically form dense green clumps or mats , often in damp or shady locations . The individual plants are usually composed of simple leaves that are generally only one cell thick , attached to a stem that may be branched or unbranched and has only a limited role in conducting water and nutrients . Although some species have conducting tissues , these are generally poorly developed and structurally different from similar tissue found in vascular plants . Mosses do not have seeds and after fertilisation develop sporophytes with unbranched stalks topped with single capsules containing spores . They are typically 0.2-10 cm ( 0.1-3.9 in ) tall , though some species are much larger . Dawsonia , the tallest moss in the world , can grow to 50 cm ( 20 in ) in height . Mosses are commonly confused with lichens , hornworts , and liverworts . Lichens may superficially resemble mosses , and sometimes have common names that include the word moss ( e.g. , reindeer moss or Iceland moss ) , but they are not related to mosses . :3 Mosses were formerly grouped with the hornworts and liverworts as non-vascular plants in the division bryophytes , all of them having the haploid gametophyte generation as the dominant phase of the life cycle . This contrasts with the pattern in all vascular plants ( seed plants and pteridophytes ) , where the diploid sporophyte generation is dominant . Mosses are now classified on their own as the division Bryophyta . There are approximately 12,000 species .",

  "/wiki/Aster_yellows": "Aster yellows is a chronic , systemic plant disease caused by a bacterium-like organism called a phytoplasma . The aster yellows phytoplasma ( AYP ) affects 300 species in 38 families of broad-leaf herbaceous plants , primarily in the aster family , as well as important cereal crops such as wheat and barley . Symptoms are variable and can include phyllody , virescence , chlorosis , stunting , and sterility of flowers . The aster leafhopper vector , Macrosteles quadrilineatus , moves the aster yellows phytoplasma from plant to plant . Its economic burden is primarily felt in the carrot ( Daucus carota ssp . sativus ) crop industry , as well as the nursery industry . No cure is known for plants infected with aster yellows . Infected plants should be removed immediately to limit the continued spread of the phytoplasma to other susceptible plants . However , in agricultural settings such as carrot fields , some application of chemical insecticides has proven to minimize the rate of infection by killing the vector .",
  "/wiki/Phytoplasma": "Phytoplasmas are obligate bacterial parasites of plant phloem tissue and of the insect vectors that are involved in their plant-to-plant transmission . Phytoplasmas were discovered in 1967 by Japanese scientists who termed them mycoplasma-like organisms . Since their discovery , phytoplasmas have resisted all attempts at in vitro culture in any cell-free medium ; routine cultivation in an artificial medium thus remains a major challenge . Although phytoplasmas have recently been reported to be grown in a specific artificial medium , experimental repetition has yet to be reported . Phytoplasmas are characterized by the lack of a cell wall , a pleiomorphic or filamentous shape , a diameter normally less than 1 \u03bcm , and a very small genome . Phytoplasmas are pathogens of agriculturally important plants , including coconut , sugarcane , and sandalwood , in which they cause a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild yellowing to death . Phytoplasmas are most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions . They are transmitted from plant to plant by vectors ( normally sap-sucking insects such as leafhoppers ) in which they both survive and replicate ."
