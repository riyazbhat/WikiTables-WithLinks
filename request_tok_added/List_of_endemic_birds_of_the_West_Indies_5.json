  "/wiki/Icteridae": "Icterids make up a family ( Icteridae ) of small- to medium-sized , often colorful , New World passerine birds . Most species have black as a predominant plumage color , often enlivened by yellow , orange , or red . The species in the family vary widely in size , shape , behavior , and coloration . The name , meaning jaundiced ones ( from the prominent yellow feathers of many species ) comes from the Ancient Greek ikteros via the Latin ictericus . This group includes the New World blackbirds , New World orioles , the bobolink , meadowlarks , grackles , cowbirds , oropendolas , and caciques . Despite the similar names , the first groups are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird ( a thrush ) or the Old World orioles .

The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba .

Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

The family name , Apodidae , is derived from the Greek \u1f04\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ( \u00e1pous ) , meaning footless , a reference to the small , weak legs of these most aerial of birds . The tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle Ages , as seen in the heraldic martlet .",

  "/wiki/Columbidae": "Columbidae is a bird family constituted of pigeons and doves . These are stout-bodied birds with short necks , and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres . They primarily feed on seeds , fruits , and plants . The family occurs worldwide , but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones . The animal order Columbiformes is also constituted of pigeons and doves , and includes about 42 genera and 310 species . The distinction between doves and pigeons in English is not consistent , and does not exist in most other languages . In contrast , in scientific and ornithological practice , dove tends to be used for smaller species and pigeon for larger ones , but this is in no way consistently applied . Historically , the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms . The bird most commonly referred to as just pigeon is the domestic pigeon , which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon . Pigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin pipio , for a peeping chick , while dove is a Germanic word that refers to the bird 's diving flight . The English dialectal word culver appears to derive from Latin columba . Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests , often using sticks and other debris , which may be placed on trees , ledges , or the ground , depending on species .",

  "/wiki/Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 ."
