  "/wiki/Normal_Park": "Normal Park is the name of a former football field in Chicago , Illinois . It was on Racine Avenue between 61st and 62nd Streets , extending to Throop Street . Normal Avenue ( or Normal Boulevard ) is also sometimes given as one of its bordering streets , although Normal Avenue ( 500W ) is about 7 blocks east of Racine ( 1200W ) , at least under the current city grid configuration . Normal Park was the home of the Chicago Cardinals , who started out as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898 and changed their name to Racine Normals after they began playing at the field . Soon after , they became the Racine Cardinals . According to legend , they assumed that nickname upon acquiring some reddish hand-me-down jerseys from the University of Chicago football team , the Maroons . The Cardinals joined the new American Professional Football Association ( soon renamed to what is now the National Football League ) and continued to use Normal Park as their home field for several years and continued to be called the Racine Cardinals for a while . They changed their name again , to Chicago Cardinals , to avoid confusion after the National Football League fielded a team in Racine , Wisconsin . Starting in 1922 , they split time between Normal Park and Comiskey Park before finally abandoning the old field in the late 1920s . The park no longer exists . On the Eastern portion of the site along Racine sits a Chicago Police Department facility and the Western portion of the site is occupied by single family homes built on a cul-de-sac where the field once was . The only evidence of the field is an otherwise unexplained discontinuation of Elizabeth Street , which abruptly ends halfway between 61st and 62nd Streets and then resumes again a half-block north at 61st .",
