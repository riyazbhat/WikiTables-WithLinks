  "/wiki/The_Presentation_of_the_Lord": "The Presentation of Jesus at ( or in ) the Temple is an early episode in the life of Jesus , describing his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem in order to officially induct him into Judaism , that is celebrated by many Christian Churches on the holiday of Candlemas . It is described in the chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible . Within the account , Luke 's narration of the Presentation in the Temple combines the purification rite with the Jewish ceremony of the redemption of the firstborn ( ) . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Presentation of Jesus at the temple is celebrated as one of the twelve Great Feasts , and is sometimes called Hypapante ( , = Meeting in Greek ) . In Western Christianity , the additional name for the Service the day , Candlemas , is added . This Feast-day is also known as the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin or the Meeting of the Lord.In some liturgical churches , Vespers ( or Compline ) on the Feast of the Presentation marks the end of the Epiphany season . In the Church of England , the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion , the Presentation of Christ in the Temple is a Principal Feast celebrated either on 2 February or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February . In the Catholic Church , especially since the time of Pope Gelasius I ( 492-496 ) who in the fifth century contributed to its expansion , the Presentation is celebrated on 2 February and is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary . In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church , the episode was also reflected in the once-prevalent custom of churching new mothers forty days after the birth of a child .",
  "/wiki/Candlemas": "Candlemas ( also spelled Candlemass ) , also known as the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus Christ and the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary , is a Christian Holy Day commemorating the presentation of Jesus at the Temple . It is based upon the account of the presentation of Jesus in Luke 2:22-40 . In accordance with Leviticus 12 : a woman was to be purified by presenting lamb as a burnt offering , and either a young pigeon or dove as sin offering , 33 days after a boy 's circumcision . It falls on February 2 , which is traditionally the 40th day of the Christmas-Epiphany season . While it is customary for Christians in some countries to remove their Christmas decorations on Twelfth Night ( Epiphany Eve ) , those in other Christian countries historically remove them on Candlemas . On Candlemas , many Christians ( especially Anglicans , Methodists , Lutherans , Orthodox and Roman Catholics ) also bring their candles to their local church , where they are blessed and then used for the rest of the year ; for Christians , these blessed candles serve as a symbol of Jesus Christ , who referred to Himself as the Light of the World .",

  "/wiki/Polycarp": "Polycarp ( ; , Pol\u00fdkarpos ; ; AD 69 155 ) was a 2nd-century Christian bishop of Smyrna . According to the Martyrdom of Polycarp , he died a martyr , bound and burned at the stake , then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body . Polycarp is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox , Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches . His name means much fruit in Greek . Both Irenaeus , who as a young man heard Polycarp speak , and Tertullian record that Polycarp had been a disciple of John the Apostle . Jerome writes that Polycarp was a disciple of John and that John had ordained him bishop of Smyrna . The late tradition surrounding Polycarp that expanded upon the Martyrdom is embodied in a collection of fragmentary Coptic-language papyri known as the Harris Fragments , dated to the 3rd to 6th centuries . These fragments compare and contrast Polycarp with John the Apostle , who , though many people had tried to kill him , was not martyred but died of old age on the island of Patmos . Frederick Weidmann , editor of the Harris fragments , interprets them as Smyrnan hagiography addressing Smyrna-Ephesus church rivalries , which develops the association of Polycarp and John to a degree unwitnessed , so far as we know , either before or since . The fragments both echo the Martyrology and diverge from it . With Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch , Polycarp is regarded as one of three chief Apostolic Fathers . He is the patron saint of Smyrna .",
