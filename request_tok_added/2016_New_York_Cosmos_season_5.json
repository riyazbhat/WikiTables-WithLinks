  "/wiki/Exhibition_game": "An exhibition game ( also known as a friendly , a scrimmage , a demonstration , a preseason game , a warmup match , or a preparation match , depending at least in part on the sport ) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player 's or the team 's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced . In team sports , matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament . If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues , exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other . The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team . An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge , to provide professional entertainment , to promote the sport , to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player , or to raise money for charities . Several sports leagues hold all-star games to showcase their best players against each other , while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world . International competitions like the Olympic Games may also hold exhibition games as part of a demonstration sport .",
