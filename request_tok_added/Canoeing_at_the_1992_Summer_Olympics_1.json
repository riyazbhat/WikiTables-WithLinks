An ethnic Pole from Ukraine , \u015aliwi\u0144ski represented the USSR at the 1988 Olympics , winning the Canadian canoe C-1 500 m silver medal at the age of only eighteen . Over the next three years he dominated the event , winning consecutive world championship gold medals in 1989 , 1990 and 1991 . However , in the 1992 Olympics he had to settle for another silver medal behind Nikolay Bukhalov of Bulgaria . The break-up of the Soviet Union affected \u015aliwi\u0144ski 's career greatly as the newly independent Ukraine did not win any world championship gold medals during the 1990s . \u015aliwi\u0144ski , now specialising in the short sprint 200 m races , was still regarded as a top competitor at international events but he endured a frustrating sequence of four world championship bronze medals . With no 200 m races included in the Olympics he competed in the C-1 500 m at Atlanta 1996 , finishing just outside the medals in fourth place . In 2001 he accepted an invitation to switch to representing Poland , a decision which dramatically revived his career . Although in his thirties he went on to win three more world titles .

Clint Robinson became Australias first canoe / kayak gold medallist when he defeated the Norwegian World Champion Knut Holmann to win the K-1 1000 m final at Barcelona in 1992 . Robinson paddled magnificently in his Barcelona final , holding off sustained challenges from Greg Barton ( US ) and Marin Popescu ( Romania ) , then emptying every reserve of energy in a finish that edged out the favourite Holmann . Afterwards he was so dehydrated that he was unable to produce a urine sample for doping analysis for six hours . Four years later in Atlanta , he lined up against Holmann again in the K-1 1000 m and led early , but finished with the bronze . In Athens in 2004 , Robinson teamed with Nathan Baggaley to win a silver medal in the K-2 500 m.
