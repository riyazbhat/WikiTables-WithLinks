  "/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)": "Thomas Sturges Watson ( born September 4 , 1949 ) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour Champions , formerly on the PGA Tour . In the 1970s and 1980s , Watson was one of the leading players in the world , winning eight major championships and heading the PGA Tour money list five times . He was the number one player in the world according to McCormack 's World Golf Rankings from 1978 until 1982 ; in both 1983 and 1984 , he was ranked second behind Seve Ballesteros . He also spent 32 weeks in the top 10 of the successor Sony Rankings in their debut in 1986 . Watson is also notable for his longevity : at nearly sixty years of age , and 26 years after his last major championship victory , he led after the second and third rounds of The Open Championship in 2009 , but lost in a four-hole playoff . With a chance to win the tournament with par on the 72nd hole , he missed an 8-foot ( 2.4 m ) putt , then lost to Stewart Cink in the playoff . Several of Watson 's major victories came at the expense of Jack Nicklaus , the man he replaced as number one , most notably the 1977 Masters , 1977 Open Championship , and the 1982 U.S. Open . Though his rivalry with Nicklaus was intense , their friendly competitiveness served to increase golf 's popularity during the time . In Watson 's illustrious career , his eight major championships include five Open Championships , two Masters titles , and one U.S. Open title . The only major that has eluded him is the PGA Championship , which would put him in an elite group of golfing career grand slam winners that includes Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , Jack Nicklaus , and Tiger Woods . In all , Watson 's eight majors ranks sixth on the list of total major championship victories , behind only Nicklaus , Woods , Walter Hagen , Hogan , and Player . Watson is also regarded as one of the greatest links players of all time , a claim backed up by his five Open Championship victories , his runner-up finishes at the 1984 Open Championship and 2009 Open Championship , and his three Senior British Open Championship titles in his mid-50s ( 2003 , 2005 , and 2007 ) .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language .

Weiskopf was born in Massillon , Ohio . He attended Benedictine High School in Cleveland , and Ohio State University , where he played on the golf team . He turned professional in 1964 . Weiskopf 's first win on the PGA Tour came at the Andy Williams-San Diego Open Invitational in 1968 , and fifteen more followed by 1982 . His career season was 1973 , when he won seven tournaments around the world , including The Open Championship at Royal Troon , and he would finish that year ranked second in the world according to Mark McCormack 's world golf rankings . This was to remain his only major championship victory , but he was a four-time runner-up at The Masters and also had a T2 finish at the 1976 U.S. Open . Weiskopf won the Canadian Open in 1973 and 1975 ; the latter win was achieved in dramatic fashion , with a one-hole playoff win over archrival Jack Nicklaus , when Weiskopf nearly holed his approach on the 15th hole at the Royal Montreal Golf Club 's Blue Course .

  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",
