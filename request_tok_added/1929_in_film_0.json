Gold Diggers of Broadway was also the third film released by Warner Bros. to be shot in color ; the first was a black-and-white , part-color musical , The Desert Song ( 1929 ) . Gold Diggers of Broadway became a box office sensation , making Winnie Lightner a worldwide star and boosting guitarist crooner Nick Lucas to further fame as he sang two songs that became 20th-century standards : Tiptoe Through the Tulips and Painting the Clouds with Sunshine . Based on the 1919 play The Gold Diggers - which was also turned into a silent film of the same name in 1923 - now lost , Gold Diggers of Broadway utilized Technicolor , showgirls , and sound as its main selling points . It earned a domestic gross of $ 3.5 million , extending to over $ 5 million worldwide ( approximately $ today ) . The original production cost was approximately $ 500,000 . It was chosen as one of the ten best films of 1929 by Film Daily . As with many early Technicolor films , no complete print survives , although the last twenty minutes do , but are missing a bridging sequence and the last minute of the film . Contemporary reviews , the soundtrack and the surviving footage suggest that the film was a fast-moving comedy which was enhanced by Technicolor and a set of lively and popular songs . It encapsulates the spirit of the flapper era , giving us a glimpse of a world about to be changed by the Great Depression . Because the film is considered a partially lost film since 1970s , the loose remake , Gold Diggers of 1933 , is the most frequently seen version of the story .",
