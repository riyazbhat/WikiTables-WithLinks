The women 's downhill course runs on the top part of Wildcard , then the bottom of Jimmy 's Joker , then finishes out of the valley on Lower Franz 's Run . Finally the course merges with the Dave Murray Downhill at the Grandstand finish . The course was labeled as extremely difficult for skiers and most training runs were cancelled due to weather conditions . This resulted in several accidents during the competition . The worst accident involved Swedish skier Anja P\u00e4rson , who lost balance on the last jump before the finish , which resulted in a sixty-meter ( 200 ft ) flight and subsequent fall , but without serious health consequences . Earlier in the same place Swiss skier Dominique Gisin fell ; P\u00e4rson returned the very next day to win the bronze in the super combined . Lindsey Vonn won the gold medal , teammate Julia Mancuso took the silver , and Elisabeth G\u00f6rgl was the bronze medalist . Through 2019 , it is the sole victory for the United States in the women 's downhill at the Olympics . G\u00f6rgl 's mother Traudl Hecher was also a bronze medalist for Austria in this event in 1960 and 1964 . The Franz 's Downhill course started at an elevation of 1,595 m ( 5,233 ft ) above sea level with a vertical drop of 770 m ( 2,526 ft ) and a length of 2.939 km ( 1.83 mi ) . Vonn 's winning time of 104.19 seconds yielded an average course speed of 101.549 km/h ( 63.1 mph ) , with an average vertical descent rate of 7.390 m/s ( 24.2 ft/s ) .",

The competition was originally scheduled to be held on February 14 , 2010 , but was postponed due to bad weather , which delayed previous events . One major change in this event for the 2010 Olympics was the switch from a traditional dedicated combined ( K ) , taking place over one or two days and involving a downhill run and two slalom runs ( as the combined had been since its reintroduction to the Olympics in 1988 ) , to a one-day super combined ( SC ) , consisting of a downhill run in the morning and one slalom run in the afternoon .",
