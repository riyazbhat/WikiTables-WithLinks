  "/wiki/Archie_MacLaren": "Archibald Campbell MacLaren ( 1 December 1871 - 17 November 1944 ) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team at various times between 1898 and 1909 . A right-handed batsman , he played 35 Test matches for England , as captain in 22 of those games , and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia . An amateur , MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire , captaining that county for most of his career . As a batsman , MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist . In 1895 , he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994 . Opinions were divided over his captaincy . He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced , but his pessimism , clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader . After attending public school , MacLaren played intermittently for Lancashire until 1899 as he tried to establish a career outside the sport . Even so , he was appointed county captain in 1894 and was chosen frequently to play for England . An appointment as Lancashire 's assistant secretary allowed him to play more regularly from 1900 . He first captained England in 1898 as a stand-in , but became captain in his own right in 1899 . Under his leadership , England lost to Australia in three consecutive series - 1899 , 1901-02 and 1902 .",

  "/wiki/Eastbourne": "Eastbourne ( /\u02c8i\u02d0stb\u0254\u02d0rn/ ( listen ) ) is a town , seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England , 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Brighton . Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head , the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate . With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels , a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum , Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets . It has a growing population , a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries . Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town , there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age . The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner , William Cavendish , later to become the Duke of Devonshire . Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town , but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration . The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne . As a seaside resort Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism , with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences , public events and cultural sightseeing . The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail , healthcare , education , construction , manufacturing , professional scientific and the technical sector . Eastbourne 's population is growing ; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412 . The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students , families and those commuting to London and Brighton .",
  "/wiki/Johnny_Briggs_(cricketer)": "Johnny Briggs ( 3 October 1862 - 11 January 1902 ) was an English left arm spin bowler who played for Lancashire County Cricket Club between 1879 and 1900 and remains the second-highest wicket-taker in the county 's history after Brian Statham . In the early days of Test cricket , Briggs was one of the most successful bowlers , proving deadly whenever wickets were affected by rain , whilst both for his county and country his batting - though at times too careless - was very useful . He was the first bowler in Test cricket to take 100 wickets , and held the record of most wickets in Test cricket on two occasions , the first in 1895 and again from 1898 until 1904 , when he was succeeded by Hugh Trumble . He toured Australia a record six times , a feat only equalled by Colin Cowdrey . Briggs was a notably short man at about five feet five or 165 centimetres . Briggs 's skill lay in his ability to vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in achieving prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century . As a batsman , Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively , but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline .",
  "/wiki/Dick_Pilling": "Richard Pilling ( 11 August 1855 - 28 March 1891 ) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Lancashire County Cricket Club and England . Born near Bedford to John and Ann Pilling , Dick moved to Church , Accrington , Lancashire in his infancy , which is where he made his name as one of the finest wicket-keepers of his time . In a first-class career lasting from 1877 to 1889 he played 250 matches , 8 of which were Test matches . In 1889 he was awarded a benefit by Lancashire : he raised \u00a31,500 . His first appearance in the Lancashire eleven dates back to the season of 1877 . His appearance for Lancashire was very happily timed , as , with Mr. E. Jackson so often prevented by business reasons from playing , the northern county might have been left without a first-class wicket-keeper . Almost from the first time he was seen in the Lancashire team it was felt that a great wicket-keeper had arisen , and he at once sprang into the front rank . From August , 1877 , down to the end of the season of 1889 he was a regular member of the Lancashire eleven , and several pages of Wisden might easily be filled with a record of his doings . For all the hard work he has done in the cricket field , Pilling was never constitutionally robust , and the serious illness which kept him out of the cricket field in 1890 originated in a severe cold which he caught during the winter when taking part in a football match . At the end of the summer he journeyed to Australia for the benefit of his health , leaving in the same steamer that took a large proportion of the Australian team . In 1891 , Pilling was rated by Wisden to the second-best wicket-keeper in the world , with Jack Blackham being rated the best . His style was described as the perfection of neatness and rapidity , without the least unnecessary show ."
