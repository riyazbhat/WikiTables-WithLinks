  "/wiki/Baltimore_Colts_(1947\u201350)": "The Baltimore Colts were a professional American football team based in Baltimore , Maryland . The first team to bear the name Baltimore Colts , they were members of the All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) from 1947 to 1949 and then joined the National Football League ( NFL ) for one season before folding . They were one of the least successful teams in the AAFC and NFL both on and off the field , winning only 11 games in their history . In 1953 , Baltimore was granted an expansion team that revived the Colts name ; since 1984 , this team is now the Indianapolis Colts . The Colts ' origin is with the Miami Seahawks , one of the charter franchises of the AAFC . After playing a single disastrous season the Seahawks were confiscated by the league , and were purchased and reorganized by a group of businessmen as the Baltimore Colts . The new team struggled through the next three seasons , but managed to grow a sizable fan base in Baltimore . In 1949 , the Colts were one of three AAFC teams , along with the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns , to be brought into the NFL following the AAFC-NFL merger . They played only during the 1950 season before financial pressures forced them to fold .",
  "/wiki/Chicago_Hornets": "The Chicago Rockets were an American football team that played in the All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) from 1946 to 1949 . During the 1949 season , the team was known as the Chicago Hornets . Unlike the Cleveland Browns , San Francisco 49ers , and Baltimore Colts , the franchise did not join the National Football League ( NFL ) prior to the 1950 season . The Chicago Rockets franchise was owned by Chicago trucking executive John L. Jack Keeshin , president of the National Jockey Club that owned and operated Sportsman 's Park race track in Cicero , Illinois . He originally attempted to purchase the Chicago White Sox from the Comiskey family but was turned down . Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward suggested starting a pro football team in the AAFC . In a market where the NFL Chicago Bears and Chicago Cardinals were already well established , Keeshin stood little chance of success . He did cause a stir by attempting to sign Chicago Bears stars Sid Luckman , George McAfee and Hugh Gallarneau without success . The Rockets played their home games at Soldier Field .",
  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dons": "The Los Angeles Dons were an American football team in the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1949 , and played its home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The Dons were the first professional football team to play a regular season game in Los Angeles , California , two weeks before the first game of the rival Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League , who had moved from Cleveland .",
  "/wiki/Buffalo_Bills_(AAFC)": "The Buffalo Bills were an American football team , based in Buffalo , New York , that played in the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1949 . During its first season in 1946 , the team was known as the Buffalo Bisons . Unlike the Cleveland Browns , San Francisco 49ers , and Baltimore Colts , the franchise was not one of the three AAFC teams that merged with the National Football League prior to the 1950 season . It was named after Buffalo Bill . After only one year , owner James Breuil held a name-the-team contest in hopes of choosing a more distinctive nickname ; Bisons had been the traditional nickname for Buffalo teams for many years . The winning choice was Bills , which was a play on the name of the famed Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody . Coincidentally a barbershop quartet who would achieve fame a few years later was formed with the same name that year . The team was the successor to the Buffalo Tigers/Indians team from the 1940 American Football League ; that league had folded as a result of World War II . There was some controversy over Buffalo 's exclusion from the enlarged NFL . Buffalo had experienced more success on the field and at the gate than Baltimore , and was also a larger market at the time ( and would not have to share their territory with an established team as Baltimore would with the Washington Redskins ) . Additionally , the original three-team plan would have left the league with 13 teams , not only an odd number and prime number that made making equal divisions impossible , but also one considered to be bad luck . The move had left Buffalo as the only AAFC market without an NFL team post-merger , and one that had outdrawn the NFL average in fan attendance .",
  "/wiki/Cleveland_Browns": "The Cleveland Browns are a professional American football team based in Cleveland . Named after original coach and co-founder Paul Brown , they compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . The Browns play their home games at FirstEnergy Stadium , which opened in 1999 , with administrative offices and training facilities in Berea , Ohio . The Browns ' official club colors are brown , orange , and white . They are unique among the 32 member franchises of the NFL in that they do not have a logo on their helmets . The franchise was founded in 1945 by Brown and businessman Arthur B. McBride as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . The Browns dominated the AAFC , compiling a 47-4-3 record in the league 's four seasons and winning its championship in each . When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season , the Browns joined the NFL along with the San Francisco 49ers and the original Baltimore Colts . The team won a championship in their inaugural NFL season , as well as in the 1954 , 1955 , and 1964 seasons , and in a feat unequaled in any of the North American major professional sports , played in their league championship game in each of the Browns ' first ten years of existence . From 1965 to 1995 , they qualified to play in the NFL playoffs 14 times , but did not win another championship or play in the Super Bowl during that period . In 1995 , owner Art Modell , who had purchased the Browns in 1961 , announced plans to move the team to Baltimore . After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans , a compromise was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the Baltimore Ravens as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Yankees_(AAFC)": "The New York Yankees were a professional American football team that played in the All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) from 1946 to 1949 . The team played in Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and often played in front of sold-out crowds [ citation needed ] . They were owned by Dan Topping , who transferred the team from the NFL Brooklyn Dodgers , retaining many of the same players . The team 's coach was Ray Flaherty , who had coached the Washington Redskins in the early 1940s . Former NFL player Jim Barber served as an assistant coach under Flaherty . The Yankees appeared in the 1946 AAFC championship game , but lost to the Cleveland Browns by a score of 14-9 . The same two teams appeared in the championship game the following year , with the Browns winning again 14-3 . Before the 1949 season , the Brooklyn Dodgers football team folded and merged into the Yankees , which became the Brooklyn-New York Yankees , but this was the final season of the AAFC , which was then absorbed by the NFL . The Yankees players were divided between the New York Giants and New York Bulldogs , who played as the New York Yanks starting in 1950 ."
