  "/wiki/Jerusalem": "Jerusalem [ note 2 ] is a city in the Middle East , located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea . It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . In 2015 , Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents , comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis , 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians .",

The village was conquered by Israeli forces on 5 November 1948 , by which time most of the Arab population had fled , leaving some 2,700 inhabitants , of which 500 were deported by Israeli soldiers in December 1948 . The town was initially named Migdal Gaza , Migdal Gad and Migdal Ashkelon by the new Jewish inhabitants . Most of the remaining Arabs were deported by 1950 .
