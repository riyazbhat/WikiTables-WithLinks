  "/wiki/Batman_Begins": "Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer . Based on the DC Comics character Batman , it stars Christian Bale , Michael Caine , Liam Neeson , Katie Holmes , Gary Oldman , Cillian Murphy , Tom Wilkinson , Rutger Hauer , Ken Watanabe , and Morgan Freeman . The film reboots the Batman film series , telling the origin story of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop Ra 's al Ghul and the Scarecrow from plunging Gotham City into chaos . Following the poor reception of Batman & Robin ( 1997 ) , a series of unsuccessful attempts were made to resurrect Batman on the big screen which put the Batman film series on hold for nearly eight years . Then , in early 2003 , Nolan and Goyer began work on Batman Begins . Aiming for a darker , more realistic tone compared to the previous films , a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience 's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character . The film , which was principally shot in the United Kingdom , Iceland and Chicago , relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects , with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films . Comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls , Batman : Year One and Batman : The Long Halloween served as inspiration . Batman Begins opened on June 15 , 2005 , in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters . It grossed over $ 48 million in its opening weekend in North America , eventually grossing over $ 375 million worldwide . The film was met with highly positive reviews , with critics praising the tone , Bale 's performance , action sequences , score , direction , and the emotional weight compared to previous Batman films . Often cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s , Batman Begins was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards .",
