  "/wiki/Yin_yang": "In Ancient Chinese philosophy , yin and yang ( and ; y\u012bny\u00e1ng , lit . dark-bright , negative-positive ) is a concept of dualism , describing how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary , interconnected , and interdependent in the natural world , and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another . In Chinese cosmology , the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy , organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives . Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle , seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle ( winter and summer ) , the landscape ( north-facing shade and south-facing brightness ) , sexual coupling ( female and male ) , the formation of both men and women as characters and sociopolitical history ( disorder and order ) . There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology . In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang , the material energy , which this universe has created itself out of , is also referred to as qi . It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things . Included among these forms are humans . Many natural dualities ( such as light and dark , fire and water , expanding and contracting , and booling and cranking ) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang . This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy , as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine , and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise , such as baguazhang , taijiquan ( t'ai chi ) , and qigong ( Chi Kung ) , as well as appearing in the pages of the I Ching . The notion of a duality can be found in many areas , such as Communities of Practice . The term dualistic-monism or dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful paradox of simultaneous unity and duality .",

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% .

  "/wiki/Absinthe": "Absinthe ( , ) is historically described as a distilled , highly alcoholic beverage ( 45-74% ABV / 90-148 U.S. proof ) . It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals , including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ( grand wormwood ) , together with green anise , sweet fennel , and other medicinal and culinary herbs . Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour , but may also be colourless . It is commonly referred to in historical literature as ( the green fairy ) . It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur , but it is not traditionally bottled with added sugar and is , therefore , classified as a spirit . Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume , but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed . Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland in the late 18th century . It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France , particularly among Parisian artists and writers . The consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists , partly due to its association with bohemian culture . From Europe and the Americas , notable absinthe drinkers included Ernest Hemingway , James Joyce , Charles Baudelaire , Paul Verlaine , Arthur Rimbaud , Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , Amedeo Modigliani , Pablo Picasso , Vincent van Gogh , Oscar Wilde , Marcel Proust , Aleister Crowley , Erik Satie , Edgar Allan Poe , Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry . Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen . The chemical compound thujone , which is present in the spirit in trace amounts , was blamed for its alleged harmful effects .",

There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used , and the related coconut macaroon is often confused with the macaron . In English , some bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two . Stanford professor of linguistics Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history with macaroni ( Italian ) . Jurafsky notes that French words ending with -on that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with -oon ( for example : balloon , cartoon , platoon ) . In the UK , many bakeries continue to use the term macaroon . The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine De Medici during the Renaissance . Since the 19th century , a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache , buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies , akin to a sandwich cookie . The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top , a ruffled circumference - referred to as the crown or foot ( or pied ) - and a flat base . It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth .
