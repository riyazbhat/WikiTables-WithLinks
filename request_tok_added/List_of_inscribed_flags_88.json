  "/wiki/Free_Territory": "Makhnovia ( Makhnovshchyna ) , also known as the Free Territory ( vilna terytoriya ; volnaya territoriya ) , resulted from an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 to 1921 . It existed from 1918 to 1921 , during which time free soviets and libertarian communes operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno 's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army . The area had a population of around seven million . Makhnovia was established with the capture of Huliaipole by Makhno 's forces on 27 November 1918 . An Insurrectionary Staff was set up in the city , becoming the territory 's de facto capital . Russian forces of the White movement under Anton Denikin occupied part of the region and formed a temporary government of Southern Russia in March 1920 , resulting in the de facto capital being momentarily moved to Katerynoslav ( modern-day Dnipro ) . In late March 1920 , Denikin 's forces retreated from the area , being driven out by the Red Army in cooperation with Makhno 's forces , whose units conducted guerrilla warfare behind Denikin 's lines . Makhnovia was disestablished on 28 August 1921 when a badly-wounded Makhno and 77 of his men escaped through Romania after several high-ranking officials were executed by Bolshevik forces . Remnants of the Black Army would continue to fight until late 1922 . As Makhnovia self-organized along anarchist principles , references to control and government are highly contentious . For example , the Makhnovists , often cited as a form of government ( with Nestor Makhno as their leader ) , played a purely military role , with Makhno himself functioning as little more than a military strategist and advisor .",

Due to decommunization the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi , after writer , actor and playwright Marko Kropyvnytskyi , who was born near the city .
