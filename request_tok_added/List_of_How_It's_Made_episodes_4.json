  "/wiki/Asphalt": "Asphalt , also known as bitumen ( UK : /\u02c8b\u026atj\u028am\u026an/ , US : /b\u026a\u02c8tju\u02d0m\u0259n , ba\u026a-/ ) , is a sticky , black , and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum . It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product , and is classed as a pitch . Before the 20th century , the term asphaltum was also used . The word is derived from the Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u00e1sphaltos . The Pitch Lake is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world , estimated to contain 10 million tons . It is located in La Brea in southwest Trinidad , within the Siparia Regional Corporation . The primary use ( 70% ) of asphalt is in road construction , where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete . Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products , including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs . In material sciences and engineering , the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance , although there is regional variation as to which term is most common . Worldwide , geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material . For the manufactured material , which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils , bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world ; however , in American English , asphalt is more commonly used . To help avoid confusion , the phrase liquid asphalt , asphalt binder , or asphalt cement is used in the U.S. Colloquially , various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar , as in the name of the La Brea Tar Pits , although tar is a different material .",
  "/wiki/Whippet_cookie": "Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats or tea-cakes are confections produced in different variations around the world , with several countries claiming to have invented them or hailing them as their national confection . Scottish chef Boyd Tunnock invented Tunnock 's teacake in 1956 when he developed the idea of using Italian meringue , adding it to a biscuit base , and covering it in milk chocolate . In Denmark the treat was originally made using cream ( hence the Danish name fl\u00f8deboller ( cream buns ) ) , but the filling was later made from egg whites to help industrialize production and improve shelf life . Many languages used to refer to these treats as phrases or compounds using a counterpart to negro ( e.g. , negro 's kiss , negro bun ) ; most but not all of these are increasingly being avoided , especially in formal writing , in favour of less stigmatising substitutes such as choco-kiss .",
  "/wiki/Loudspeaker": "A loudspeaker ( or loud-speaker or speaker ) is an electroacoustic transducer ; a device which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound . The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the dynamic speaker , invented in 1924 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice . The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone , but in reverse , to produce sound from an electrical signal . When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil , a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet , the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday 's law of induction , which causes a diaphragm ( usually conically shaped ) attached to the coil to move back and forth , pushing on the air to create sound waves . Besides this most common method , there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound . The sound source ( e.g. , a sound recording or a microphone ) must be amplified or strengthened with an audio power amplifier before the signal is sent to the speaker . Speakers are typically housed in a speaker enclosure or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular or square box made of several forms of wood , or sometimes plastic . The enclosure 's materials and design play an important role in the quality of the sound . The enclosure generally must be as stiff and non-resonant as practically possible . Where high fidelity reproduction of sound is required , multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure , each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ( picture at right ) . In this case the individual speakers are referred to as drivers and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker . Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called tweeters , those for middle frequencies are called mid-range drivers , and those for low frequencies are called woofers .",
  "/wiki/Electronic_lock": "An electronic lock ( or electric lock ) is a locking device which operates by means of electric current . Electric locks are sometimes stand-alone with an electronic control assembly mounted directly to the lock . Electric locks may be connected to an access control system , the advantages of which include : key control , where keys can be added and removed without re-keying the lock cylinder ; fine access control , where time and place are factors ; and transaction logging , where activity is recorded . Electronic locks can also be remotely monitored and controlled , both to lock and to unlock .",
  "/wiki/Stove": "A stove is an enclosed space in which fuel is burned to heat either the space in which the stove is situated , or items placed on the heated stove . There are many types of stoves , such as the kitchen stove , which is used to cook food , and the wood-burning stove or a coal stove , which is typically used for heating a dwelling . Due to concerns about air pollution , efforts have been made to improve the stove design over the years . Pellet stoves , for example , are a type of clean-burning stove , and air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely and therefore reduce the amount of the resulted combustion by-products . Another possibility is the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas ( e.g . filter or afterburner ) . All wood stoves manufactured In the United States since 1992 are required to limit emission of particulates .",

It may be made from soft leather , canvas , or satin , and has flexible , thin soles . Traditionally , women wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes . Tan colored slippers - which are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing barefoot - are worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both men and women . All dancers typically wear ballet slippers at the beginning of a ballet class , whereas female dancers may change into pointe shoes for centre work and performance . Ballet shoes must fit very closely to the foot , for safety and to retain maximum flexibility .",
  "/wiki/Bus": "A bus ( contracted from omnibus , with variants multibus , motorbus , autobus , etc . ) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers . Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers . The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus , with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses , and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses while coaches are used for longer-distance services . Many types of buses , such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches , charge a fare . Other types , such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare . In many jurisdictions , bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver 's licence . Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport , scheduled coach transport , school transport , private hire , or tourism ; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes , including rock and pop band tour vehicles . Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s , followed by steam buses in the 1830s , and electric trolleybuses in 1882 . The first internal combustion engine buses , or motor buses , were used in 1895 . Recently , interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses , fuel cell buses , and electric buses , as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel . As of the 2010s , bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised , with the same designs appearing around the world .",

A menstrual pad is a type of feminine hygiene product that is worn externally , unlike tampons and menstrual cups which are worn inside the vagina . The pad has to be changed several times in 24 hours depending on whether menstrual flow is heavy or light . Menstrual pads are made from a range of materials , differing depending on style , country of origin , and brand . US brands include Kotex , Always , Equate , and Stayfree . Lil-lets are available in several other English-speaking countries . These pads are not to be confused with generally higher absorbency incontinence pads , which are worn by people who have urinary incontinence problems or experience stress incontinence . Although menstrual pads are not made for this use , some people use them for this purpose .",
  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",
  "/wiki/Pipe_(material)": "A pipe is a tubular section or hollow cylinder , usually but not necessarily of circular cross-section , used mainly to convey substances which can flow - liquids and gases ( fluids ) , slurries , powders and masses of small solids . It can also be used for structural applications ; hollow pipe is far stiffer per unit weight than solid members . In common usage the words pipe and tube are usually interchangeable , but in industry and engineering , the terms are uniquely defined . Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured , pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter ( OD ) and a schedule that defines the thickness . Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness , but may be specified by any two of OD , inside diameter ( ID ) , and wall thickness . Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards . While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing , tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances . Many industrial and government standards exist for the production of pipe and tubing . The term tube is also commonly applied to non-cylindrical sections , i.e. , square or rectangular tubing . In general , pipe is the more common term in most of the world , whereas tube is more widely used in the United States . Both pipe and tube imply a level of rigidity and permanence , whereas a hose ( or hosepipe ) is usually portable and flexible . Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as elbows , tees , and so on , while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations .",

  "/wiki/Tire": "A tire ( American English ) or tyre ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel 's rim to transfer a vehicle 's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over . Most tires , such as those for automobiles and bicycles , are pneumatically inflated structures , which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface . Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively . The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber , natural rubber , fabric and wire , along with carbon black and other chemical compounds . They consist of a tread and a body . The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air . Before rubber was developed , the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear . Early rubber tires were solid ( not pneumatic ) . Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles , including cars , bicycles , motorcycles , buses , trucks , heavy equipment , and aircraft . Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars , and solid rubber ( or other polymer ) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications , such as some casters , carts , lawnmowers , and wheelbarrows .",
  "/wiki/Sewage_treatment": "Sewage treatment is the process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater , containing mainly household sewage plus some industrial wastewater . Physical , chemical , and biological processes are used to remove contaminants and produce treated wastewater ( or treated effluent ) that is safe enough for release into the environment . A by-product of sewage treatment is a semi-solid waste or slurry , called sewage sludge . The sludge has to undergo further treatment before being suitable for disposal or application to land . Sewage treatment may also be referred to as wastewater treatment . However , the latter is a broader term which can also refer to industrial wastewater . For most cities , the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pre-treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load . If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff ( stormwater ) to the sewage treatment plant . Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps . The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills . Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage .",
  "/wiki/Ambulance": "An ambulance is a medically equipped vehicle which transports patients to treatment facilities , such as hospitals . In some instances , out-of-hospital medical care is provided to the patient . Ambulances are used to respond to medical emergencies by emergency medical services . For this purpose , they are generally equipped with flashing warning lights and sirens . They can rapidly transport paramedics and other first responders to the scene , carry equipment for administering emergency care and transport patients to hospital or other definitive care . Most ambulances use a design based on vans or pick-up trucks . Others take the form of motorcycles , cars , buses , aircraft and boats . Generally , vehicles count as an ambulance if they can transport patients . However , it varies by jurisdiction as to whether a non-emergency patient transport vehicle ( also called an ambulette ) is counted as an ambulance . These vehicles are not usually ( although there are exceptions ) equipped with life-support equipment , and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances . Conversely , EMS agencies may also have emergency response vehicles that can not transport patients . These are known by names such as nontransporting EMS vehicles , fly-cars or response vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Diatonic": "Diatonic ( ) and chromatic ( ) are terms in music theory that are most often used to characterize scales , and are also applied to musical instruments , intervals , chords , notes , musical styles , and kinds of harmony . They are very often used as a pair , especially when applied to contrasting features of the common practice music of the period 1600-1900 . These terms may mean different things in different contexts . Very often , diatonic refers to musical elements derived from the modes and transpositions of the white note scale C-D-E-F-G-A-B . In some usages it includes all forms of heptatonic scale that are in common use in Western music ( the major , and all forms of the minor ) . Chromatic most often refers to structures derived from the twelve-note chromatic scale , which consists of all semitones .

  "/wiki/Accordion": "Accordions ( from 19th-century German Akkordeon , from Akkord - musical chord , concord of sounds ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type , colloquially referred to as a squeezebox . A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist . The concertina and bandone\u00f3n are related ; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family . The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys , causing pallets to open , which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel , called reeds . These vibrate to produce sound inside the body . Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument 's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block . [ notes 1 ] The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual , and the accompaniment , consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons , on the left-hand manual . The accordion is widely spread across the world . In some countries ( for example Brazil , Colombia , Dominican Republic , Mexico and Panama ) it is used in popular music ( for example Gaucho , Forr\u00f3 and Sertanejo in Brazil , Vallenato in Colombia , and norte\u00f1o in Mexico ) , whereas in other regions ( such as Europe , North America and other countries in South America ) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and is often used in folk music in Europe , North America and South America . In Europe and North America , some popular music acts also make use of the instrument . Additionally , the accordion is used in cajun , zydeco , jazz music and in both solo and orchestral performances of classical music .

An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in water . A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7.0 . The adjective alkaline is commonly , and alkalescent less often , used in English as a synonym for basic , especially for bases soluble in water . This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the Arrhenius definition of a base , and they are still among the most common bases .",
  "/wiki/Battery_(electricity)": "A battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices such as flashlights , mobile phones , and electric cars . When a battery is supplying electric power , its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode . The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that will flow through an external electric circuit to the positive terminal . When a battery is connected to an external electric load , a redox reaction converts high-energy reactants to lower-energy products , and the free-energy difference is delivered to the external circuit as electrical energy . Historically the term battery specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells , however the usage has evolved to include devices composed of a single cell . Primary ( single-use or disposable ) batteries are used once and discarded ; the electrode materials are irreversibly changed during discharge . Common examples are the alkaline battery used for flashlights and a multitude of portable electronic devices . Secondary ( rechargeable ) batteries can be discharged and recharged multiple times using an applied electric current ; the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current . Examples include the lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and lithium-ion batteries used for portable electronics such as laptops and mobile phones . Batteries come in many shapes and sizes , from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to small , thin cells used in smartphones , to large lead acid batteries or lithium-ion batteries in vehicles , and at the largest extreme , huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers .

There are two basic styles of cowboy boots , western ( or classic ) , and roper . The classic style is distinguished by a tall boot shaft , going to at least mid-calf , with an angled cowboy heel , usually over one inch high . A slightly lower , still angled , walking heel is also common . The toe of western boots was originally rounded or squared in shape . The narrow pointed toe design appeared in the early 1940s . A newer design , the roper style , has a short boot shaft that stops above the ankle but before the middle of the calf , with a very low and squared-off roper heel , shaped to the sole of the boot , usually less than one inch high . Roper boots are usually made with rounded toes , but , correlating with style changes in streetwear , styles with a squared toe are seen . The roper style is also manufactured in a lace-up design which often fits better around the ankle and is less likely to slip off , but lacing also creates safety issues for riding .

  "/wiki/B\u00fbche_de_No\u00ebl": "A Yule log ( or b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl ) is a traditional dessert served near Christmas , especially in Belgium , France , Switzerland , Canada , Lebanon and several former French colonies , as well as the United Kingdom and Spain . Made of sponge cake to resemble a miniature actual Yule log , it is a form of sweet roulade . The original Yule log recipe emerged during the 19th century . It is traditionally made from a genoise , generally baked in a large , shallow Swiss roll pan , iced , rolled to form a cylinder , and iced again on the outside . The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate buttercream , though many variations that include chocolate cake , ganache , and icings flavored with espresso or liqueurs exist . Yule logs are often served with one end cut off and set atop the cake , or protruding from its side to resemble a chopped off branch . A bark-like texture is often produced by dragging a fork through the icing , and powdered sugar sprinkled to resemble snow . Other cake decorations may include actual tree branches , fresh berries , and mushrooms made of meringue or marzipan . The name b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl originally referred to the Yule log itself , and was transferred to the dessert only after the custom had fallen out of use , presumably during the first half of the 20th century . By 1945 , it referred to the cake .",
  "/wiki/Fishing_lure": "A fishing lure is a type of artificial fishing bait which is designed to attract a fish 's attention . The lure uses movement , vibration , flash and color to bait fish . Many lures are equipped with one or more hooks that are used to catch fish when they strike the lure . Some lures are placed to attract fish so a spear can be impaled into the fish or so the fish can be captured by hand . Most lures are attached to the end of a fishing line and have various styles of hooks attached to the body and are designed to elicit a strike resulting in a hookset . Many lures are commercially made but some are hand made such as fishing flies . Hand tying fly lures to match the hatch is considered a challenge by many amateur entomologists . Modern commercial lures usually are often used with a fishing rod and fishing reel but there are some who use a technique where they hold the line in their hands . Handlining is a technique in which the line is held directly in the hands versus being fed through the guides of a fishing rod . Longlining also can employ lures to catch fish . When a lure is used for casting , it is continually cast out and retrieved , the retrieve making the lure swim or produce a popping action . A skilled angler can explore many possible hiding places for fish through lure casting such as under logs and on flats .",
  "/wiki/Ice_hockey_goaltending_equipment": "In ice hockey , the goaltender wears specialized goaltending equipment to protect himself from the impact of the puck and to assist himself in making saves . Most modern goaltending equipment is made from hydrophobic synthetic leather and nylon on the outside and dense closed-cell foams and plastics inside . In the past , pads were often made out of leather and stuffed with horse hair . Professional pads were stuffed with deer hair , which is hollow , giving more protection . The National Hockey League ( NHL ) specifies maximum dimensions of goaltending equipment to prevent goaltenders from having an unfair advantage . Many other professional and non-professional leagues adhere to equipment size regulations based on International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) rules .",
  "/wiki/Lapel_pin": "A lapel pin , also known as an enamel pin , is a small pin worn on clothing , often on the lapel of a jacket , attached to a bag , or displayed on a piece of fabric . Lapel pins can be ornamental or can indicate wearer 's affiliation with an organization or cause . Before the popularity of wearing lapel pins , boutonni\u00e8res were worn .",
  "/wiki/Cardboard_box": "Cardboard boxes are industrially prefabricated boxes , primarily used for packaging goods and materials and can also be recycled . Specialists in industry seldom use the term cardboard because it does not denote a specific material . The term cardboard may refer to a variety of heavy paper-like materials , including , card stock , corrugated fiberboard , or paperboard . The meaning of the term may depend on the locale , contents , construction , and personal choice .",
  "/wiki/Lead_crystal": "Lead glass , commonly called crystal , is a variety of glass in which lead replaces the calcium content of a typical potash glass . Lead glass contains typically 18-40% ( by weight ) lead ( II ) oxide ( PbO ) , while modern lead crystal , historically also known as flint glass due to the original silica source , contains a minimum of 24% PbO . Lead glass is desirable owing to its decorative properties . Originally discovered by Englishman George Ravenscroft in 1674 , the technique of adding lead oxide ( in quantities of between 10 and 30% ) improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel . This technique also increased the working period making the glass easier to manipulate . The term lead crystal is , technically , not an accurate term to describe lead glass , as being an amorphous solid , glass lacks a crystalline structure . The use of the term lead crystal remains popular for historical and commercial reasons . It is retained from the Venetian word cristallo to describe the rock crystal imitated by Murano glassmakers . This naming convention has been maintained to the present day to describe decorative hollow-ware . Lead crystal glassware was formerly used to store and serve drinks , but due to the health risks of lead , this has become rare . One alternative material is crystal glass , in which barium oxide , zinc oxide , or potassium oxide are employed instead of lead oxide . Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal , but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power .",
  "/wiki/Wine_glass": "A wine glass is a type of glass that is used to drink and taste wine . Most wine glasses are stemware , that is they are goblets composed of three parts : the bowl , stem , and foot .",
  "/wiki/Cement": "A cement is a binder , a substance used for construction that sets , hardens , and adheres to other materials to bind them together . Cement is seldom used on its own , but rather to bind sand and gravel ( aggregate ) together . Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry , or with sand and gravel , produces concrete . Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet 's most-consumed resource . Cements used in construction are usually inorganic , often lime or calcium silicate based , and can be characterized as either hydraulic or non-hydraulic , depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water ( see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster ) . Non-hydraulic cement does not set in wet conditions or under water . Rather , it sets as it dries and reacts with carbon dioxide in the air . It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting . Hydraulic cements ( e.g. , Portland cement ) set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water . The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack . This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack . The chemical process for hydraulic cement was found by ancient Romans who used volcanic ash ( pozzolana ) with added lime ( calcium oxide ) .",
  "/wiki/Coffin": "A coffin is a funerary box used for viewing or keeping a corpse , either for burial or cremation . The word took two different paths . Old French cofin , originally meaning basket , became coffin in English ; its modern French form , couffin , means cradle . A distinction is often made between coffin and casket : the latter is generally understood to denote a four-sided or eight-sided ( almost always rectangular ) funerary box , while a coffin is usually six-sided or twelve-sided ( almost always a stretchy hexagonal ) funerary box . However , coffins having a one-piece side with a curve at the shoulder instead of a join are more commonly used in the United Kingdom ( UK ) .",
  "/wiki/Soft_drink": "A soft drink ( see \u00a7 Terminology for other names ) is a drink that usually contains carbonated water ( although some lemonades are not carbonated ) , a sweetener , and a natural or artificial flavoring . The sweetener may be a sugar , high-fructose corn syrup , fruit juice , a sugar substitute ( in the case of diet drinks ) , or some combination of these . Soft drinks may also contain caffeine , colorings , preservatives , and/or other ingredients . Soft drinks are called soft in contrast with hard alcoholic drinks . Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink , but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many countries and localities if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic . Fruit punch , tea ( even kombucha ) , and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition , but are not generally referred to as such . Unsweetened sparkling water may be consumed as an alternative to soft drinks . Soft drinks may be served chilled , over ice cubes , or at room temperature , especially soda . They are available in many container formats , including cans , glass bottles , and plastic bottles . Containers come in a variety of sizes , ranging from small bottles to large multi-liter containers . Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants , movie theaters , convenience stores , casual-dining restaurants , dedicated soda stores , and bars from soda fountain machines . Soft drinks are usually served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three venues .",
  "/wiki/Rocking_chair": "A rocking chair or rocker is a type of chair with two curved bands ( also known as rockers ) attached to the bottom of the legs , connecting the legs on each side to each other . The rockers contact the floor at only two points , giving the occupant the ability to rock back and forth by shifting their weight or pushing lightly with their feet . Rocking chairs are most commonly made of wood . Some rocking chairs can fold . Rocking chairs have taken off in many airports in the United States . The chairs at North Carolinas CTL offer frequent travelers a respite from the headache of modern air travel . Reports find the chairs are favorites of travels connecting from JFK and other North Eastern points of embarkation .",
  "/wiki/Knife": "A knife ( plural knives ; possibly from Old Norse knifr ( blade ) ) is a tool with a cutting edge or blade attached to a handle . The earliest tool used by mankind , knives appeared at least two-and-a-half million years ago , as evidenced by the Oldowan tools . Originally made of rock , bone , flint , and obsidian , over the centuries , in step with improvements in metallurgy or manufacture , knife blades have been made from bronze , copper , iron , steel , ceramics , and titanium . Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades ; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin . Knives can serve various purposes . Hunters use a hunting knife , soldiers use the combat knife , scouts , campers , and hikers carry a pocket knife ; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods ( the chef 's knife , the paring knife , bread knife , cleaver ) , table knives ( butter knives and steak knives ) , weapons ( daggers or switchblades ) , knives for throwing or juggling , and knives for religious ceremony or display ( the kirpan ) .",
  "/wiki/Mannequin": "A mannequin ( also called a manikin , dummy , lay figure or dress form ) is an often articulated doll used by artists , tailors , dressmakers , windowdressers and others especially to display or fit clothing . The term is also used for life-sized dolls with simulated airways used in the teaching of first aid , CPR , and advanced airway management skills such as tracheal intubation and for human figures used in computer simulation to model the behavior of the human body . During the 1950s , mannequins were used in nuclear tests to help show the effects of nuclear weapons on humans . Mannequin comes from the French word mannequin , which had acquired the meaning an artist 's jointed model , which in turn came from the Flemish word manneken , meaning little man , figurine . In early use in the United Kingdom , it referred to fashion models themselves , the meaning as a dummy dating from the start of World War II .",
  "/wiki/Sock": "A sock is a piece of clothing worn on the feet and often covering the ankle or some part of the calf . Some type of shoe or boot is typically worn over socks . In ancient times , socks were made from leather or matted animal hair . In the late 16th century , machine-knit socks were first produced . Until 1800 both hand knitting and machine knitting were used to produce socks , but after 1800 , machine knitting became the predominant method . One of the roles of socks is absorbing perspiration . The foot is among the heaviest producers of sweat in the body , as it can produce over of perspiration per day ; socks help to absorb this sweat and draw it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration . In cold environments , socks made from wool insulate the foot and decrease the risk of frostbite . Socks are worn with sport shoes ( typically white-coloured socks ) and dress shoes ( typically dark-coloured socks ) . In addition to the numerous practical roles played by socks , they are also a fashion item , and they are available in myriad colours and patterns .",
  "/wiki/Hypodermic_needle": "A hypodermic needle ( from Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf- ( under- ) , and \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 ( skin ) ) , one of a category of medical tools which enter the skin , called sharps , is a very thin , hollow tube with a sharp tip that contains a small opening at the pointed end . It is commonly used with a syringe , a hand-operated device with a plunger , to inject substances into the body ( e.g. , saline solution , solutions containing various drugs or liquid medicines ) or extract fluids from the body ( e.g. , blood ) . They are used to take liquid samples from the body , for example taking blood from a vein in venipuncture . Large-bore hypodermic intervention is especially useful in catastrophic blood loss or treating shock . A hypodermic needle is used for rapid delivery of liquids , or when the injected substance can not be ingested , either because it would not be absorbed ( as with insulin ) , or because it would harm the liver . There are many possible routes for an injection , with the arm being a common location . The hypodermic needle also serves an important role in research environments where sterile conditions are required . The hypodermic needle significantly reduces contamination during inoculation of a sterile substrate . The hypodermic needle reduces contamination for two reasons : First , its surface is extremely smooth , which prevents airborne pathogens from becoming trapped between irregularities on the needle 's surface , which would subsequently be transferred into the media ( e.g . agar ) as contaminants ; second , the needle 's surface is extremely sharp , which significantly reduces the diameter of the hole remaining after puncturing the membrane and consequently prevents microbes larger than this hole from contaminating the substrate .",
  "/wiki/Distribution_board": "A distribution board ( also known as panelboard , breaker panel , or electric panel ) is a component of an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits , while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure . Normally , a main switch , and in recent boards , one or more residual-current devices ( RCD ) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection ( RCBO ) , are also incorporated . In the United Kingdom , a distribution board designed for domestic installations is known as a consumer unit .",
  "/wiki/Kite": "A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag . A kite consists of wings , tethers and anchors . Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it . Some kite designs dont need a bridle ; box kites can have a single attachment point . A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite . One technical definition is that a kite is a collection of tether-coupled wing sets . The name derives from its resemblance to a hovering bird . The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kite 's surface , producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings . The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind . The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached . The anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving ( e.g. , the towing of a kite by a running person , boat , free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle ) . The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids , so kites can be used in underwater currents , but there are no everyday uses as yet .",
  "/wiki/Glasses": "Glasses , also known as eyeglasses or spectacles , are vision aids , consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person 's eyes , typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears . Glasses are typically used for vision correction , such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness . Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians ; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses . Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation . Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports , such as squash . Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports . Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck , to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking . Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight , and may protect one 's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light . Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare ; Photochromatic glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions , but turn into sunglasses when in they come in contact with ultraviolet light . Most over the counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses ; however , special prescription sunglasses can be made . Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information , for example 3D glasses for 3D films ( stereoscopy ) . Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes .",
  "/wiki/Toothbrush": "The toothbrush is an oral hygiene instrument used to clean the teeth , gums , and tongue . It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristle , atop of which toothpaste can be applied , mounted on a handle which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth . They are usually used alongside floss . They are available with different bristle textures , sizes , and forms . Most dentists recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate the gums . Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses and instead should be spat out , the act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom , where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for germ growth ( and , if it is a wooden toothbrush , mold as well ) . Many toothbrushes have wooden handles , often bamboo . However , numerous others are made of cheap plastic ; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution . Over 1 billion toothbrushes are disposed of into landfills annually in the United States alone . Bristles are commonly made of nylon ( which , while not biodegradable , as plastic is , may still be recycled ) or bamboo viscose ."
