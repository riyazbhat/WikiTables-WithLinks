  "/wiki/Aquinas_College_(Michigan)": "The Congregation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers ( Dominican Order ) , today commonly known as the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids , Michigan , led by Mother Aquinata Fiegler , OP , founded the Roman Catholic Novitiate Normal School in Traverse City , Michigan in 1886 . The School 's mission was to educate young women who had yet to make their vows in the Order of Preachers , i. e. , novitiates , to be parochial elementary school teachers throughout Michigan , and it trained and sent forth numerous sister teachers successfully . In 1911 the School was transferred to Grand Rapids , along with the motherhouse of the Sisters , pursuant to an invitation of the Bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids . In response to the need for their sister teachers to hold baccalaureate degrees , in 1922 the Sisters reorganized the Novitiate Normal School as Sacred Heart College and also commenced admitting lay women . The State of Michigan granted a charter to award two-year degrees to women to the new College in the same year . The site of the new College was transferred to the newly erected motherhouse of the Sisters on East Fulton Street , in the margins of Grand Rapids . At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College . In 1931 , it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College , transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library , and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational . Bishop Joseph G. Pinten of Grand Rapids instigated the reform to admit men alongside women . At that time it awarded two-year degrees . In 1939 Catholic Junior College added a third year to its curriculum . The College began awarding four-year baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Aquinas College in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas , OP and its founder , Mother Aquinata Fiegler , OP , in 1940 , but the articles of incorporation to legally effect the institutional change were not filed with the State of Michigan until 1941 .",
