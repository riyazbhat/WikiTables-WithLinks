The BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport . Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households , companies , and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts and iPlayer catch-up . The fee is set by the British Government , agreed by Parliament , and used to fund the BBC 's radio , TV , and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK . Since 1 April 2014 , it has also funded the BBC World Service ( launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service ) , which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV , radio , and online services in Arabic and Persian . Around a quarter of BBC 's revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios ( formerly BBC Worldwide ) , which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC 's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News , and from BBC.com , provided by BBC Global News Ltd .

  "/wiki/ITV_Network": "ITV is a British free-to-air television network with its headquarters in London .

ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV . STV Group plc uses the STV brand for its two franchises of central and northern Scotland .",

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

Such languages include Fiji Hindi , which is official in Fiji , and Caribbean Hindustani , which is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago , Guyana , and Suriname .

The fourth English-language screen adaptation of Agatha Christie 's 1939 novel And Then There Were None , it was the third version to be produced by Harry Alan Towers , following his 1965 and 1974 adaptations . The opening credits state that this film is based on Christie 's 1943 stage adaptation and make no mention of the novel itself , perhaps because the film 's climax is taken almost verbatim from the stage script .

  "/wiki/Savannah": "A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland-grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close . The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses . Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density . It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced , scattered trees . However , in many savannas , tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests . The South American savanna types cerrado sensu stricto and cerrado dense typically have densities of trees similar to or higher than that found in South American tropical forests , with savanna ranging from 800-3300 trees per hectare ( trees/ha ) and adjacent forests with 800-2000 trees/ha . Similarly Guinean savanna has 129 trees/ha , compared to 103 for riparian forest , while Eastern Australian sclerophyll forests have average tree densities of approximately 100 per hectare , comparable to savannas in the same region . Savannas are also characterised by seasonal water availability , with the majority of rainfall confined to one season ; they are associated with several types of biomes , and are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland . Savanna covers approximately 20% of the Earth 's land area .",
