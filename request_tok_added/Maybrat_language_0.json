  "/wiki/Phoneme": "A phoneme ( ) is a unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another in a particular language . For example , in most dialects of English , the sound patterns ( sin ) and ( sing ) are two separate words that are distinguished by the substitution of one phoneme , , for another phoneme , . Two words like this that differ in meaning through the contrast of a single phoneme form a minimal pair . If , in another language , the two sequences differing only by pronunciation of the final nasal consonant are interpreted as being the same word , phonetic ( as in English sin ) and ( as in English sing ) are pronunciations of a single phoneme in that language . Phonemes that are established by the use of minimal pairs , such as tap vs tab or pat vs bat , are written between slashes : , . To show pronunciation , linguists use square brackets : ( indicating an aspirated p in pat ) . Within linguistics , there are differing views as to exactly what phonemes are and how a given language should be analyzed in phonemic ( or phonematic ) terms . However , a phoneme is generally regarded as an abstraction of a set ( or equivalence class ) of speech sounds ( phones ) that are perceived as equivalent to each other in a given language . For example , the English k sounds in the words kill and skill are not identical ( as described below ) , but they are distributional variants of a single phoneme . Speech sounds that differ but do not create a meaningful change in the word are known as allophones of the same phoneme . Allophonic variation may be conditioned , in which case a certain phoneme is realized as a certain allophone in particular phonological environments , or it may otherwise be free , and may vary by speaker or by dialect . Therefore , phonemes are often considered to constitute an abstract underlying representation for segments of words , while speech sounds make up the corresponding phonetic realization , or the surface form .",
  "/wiki/Allophone": "In phonology , an allophone ( ; from the Greek , \u00e1llos , other and , ph\u014dn\u0113 , voice , sound ) is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds , or phones , or signs used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language . For example , in English , ( as in stop ) and the aspirated form ( as in top ) are allophones for the phoneme , while these two are considered to be different phonemes in some languages such as Thai and Hindi . On the other hand , in Spanish , ( as in dolor ) and ( as in nada ) are allophones for the phoneme , while these two are considered to be different phonemes in English . The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context , with such allophones being called positional variants , but some allophones occur in free variation . Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme usually does not change the meaning of a word , but the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible . Native speakers of a given language perceive one phoneme in the language as a single distinctive sound and are both unaware of and even shocked by the allophone variations that are used to pronounce single phonemes .",
  "/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel": "The open front unrounded vowel , or low front unrounded vowel , is a type of vowel sound , used in some spoken languages . It is one of the eight primary cardinal vowels , not directly intended to correspond to a vowel sound of a specific language but rather to serve as a fundamental reference point in a phonetic measuring system . The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) that represents this sound is , and in the IPA vowel chart it is positioned at the lower-left corner . However , the accuracy of the quadrilateral vowel chart is disputed , and the sound has been analyzed acoustically as extra-open at a position where the front/back distinction has lost its significance . There are also differing interpretations of the exact quality of the vowel : the classic sound recording of by Daniel Jones is slightly more front but not quite as open as that by John Wells . In practice , it is considered normal by many phoneticians to use the symbol for an open central unrounded vowel and instead approximate the open front unrounded vowel with ( which officially signifies a near-open front unrounded vowel ) . This is the usual practice , for example , in the historical study of the English language . The loss of separate symbols for open and near-open front vowels is usually considered unproblematic , because the perceptual difference between the two is quite small , and very few languages contrast the two . If there is a need to specify the backness of the vowel as fully front one can use the symbol , which denotes a lowered near-open front unrounded vowel . The Hamont dialect of Limburgish has been reported to contrast long open front , central and back unrounded vowels . This is extremely unusual .",

The letter is called script a because it lacks the extra hook on top of a printed letter a , which corresponds to a different vowel , the open front unrounded vowel . Script a , which has its linear stroke on the bottom right , should not be confused with turned script a , , which has its linear stroke on the top left and corresponds to a rounded version of this vowel , the open back rounded vowel .

It is normally written , but if precision is required , diacritics may be used , such as or ( the former , indicating lowering , being more common ) . For many of the languages that have only one phonemic front unrounded vowel in the mid-vowel area ( neither close nor open ) , the vowel is pronounced as a true mid vowel and is phonetically distinct from either a close-mid or open-mid vowel . Examples are Basque , Spanish , Romanian , Japanese , Turkish , Finnish , Greek , Hejazi Arabic , Serbo-Croatian and Korean ( Seoul dialect ) . A number of dialects of English also have such a mid front vowel . However , there is no general predisposition . Igbo and Egyptian Arabic , for example , have a close-mid , and Bulgarian has an open-mid , but none of these languages have another phonemic mid front vowel . Kensiu , spoken in Malaysia and Thailand , is claimed to be unique in having true-mid vowels that are phonemically distinct from both close-mid and open-mid vowels , without differences in other parameters such as backness or roundedness .",

The International Phonetic Association advises serifs on the symbol 's ends . Some sans-serif fonts do meet this typographic specification . Prior to 1989 , there was an alternate symbol for this sound : \u27e8 \u0269 \u27e9 , the use of which is no longer sanctioned by the IPA . Despite that , some modern writings still use it . Handbook of the International Phonetic Association defines [ \u026a ] as a mid-centralized ( lowered and centralized ) close front unrounded vowel ( transcribed [ i\u033d ] or [ \u00ef\u031e ] ) , and the current official IPA name of the vowel transcribed with the symbol \u27e8 \u026a \u27e9 is near-close near-front unrounded vowel . However , some languages have the close-mid near-front unrounded vowel , a vowel that is somewhat lower than the canonical value of [ \u026a ] , though it still fits the definition of a mid-centralized [ i ] . It occurs in some dialects of English ( such as Californian , General American and modern Received Pronunciation ) as well as some other languages ( such as Icelandic ) , and it can be transcribed with the symbol \u27e8 \u026a\u031e \u27e9 ( a lowered \u27e8 \u026a \u27e9 ) in narrow transcription .

Lindsey also says that more open variants of used formerly in SSB are satisfyingly represented by the symbols and in narrow phonetic transcription , and in phonemic/broad phonetic transcription .
