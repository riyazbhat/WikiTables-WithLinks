  "/wiki/Toronto_Argonauts": "The Toronto Argonauts ( officially the Toronto Argonaut Football Club , commonly referred to as the Argos ) are a professional Canadian football team competing in the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . Based in Toronto , Ontario , the team was founded in 1873 , and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name , and they are the oldest-surviving team in both the modern-day CFL and East Division . The team 's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre ( originally known as SkyDome ) from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field , the fifth stadium site to host the team . The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 17 times and have appeared in the final 23 times . Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 27-24 in the 105th Grey Cup in 2017 . The Argonauts hold the best winning percentage in the championship game ( 73.9% ) and have the longest active winning streak in games in which they have appeared , at six . The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup , while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats . The team was founded and owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years , and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956 . The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades , with attendance peaking in the 1970s . In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 's Larry Tanenbaum ( via the Kilmer Group ) and Bell Canada would acquire the team . The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season , which has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and announced plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium , rendering it unfit for football .",

  "/wiki/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats": "The Hamilton Tiger-Cats are a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada . They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field . They were founded in 1869 as the Hamilton Football Club ( nickname Tigers ) . In 1950 , the Tigers merged with cross-town upstart Hamilton Wildcats and adopted the nickname Tiger-Cats . Since the 1950 merger , the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times , most recently in 1999 . The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club also recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history , which would bring their win total to 15 ( the Hamilton Tigers with five , Hamilton Flying Wildcats with one and Hamilton Alerts also with one ) . However , the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise , rather as the individual franchises that won them . If one includes their historical lineage , Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century , a feat matched by only one other North American franchise in professional sports , the Triple-A Minor League Baseball team Rochester Red Wings of the International League . None of these three teams won a championship in the first two decades of the 21st century . In their first forty years of existence the Tiger-Cats qualified for the playoffs in all but three of those years and won seven Grey Cup championships . They are one of six teams in the modern era to win the Grey Cup at home and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in 1972 .",
