  "/wiki/Satellite_Catalog_Number": "The Satellite Catalog Number ( also known as NORAD ( North American Aerospace Defense ) Catalog Number , NORAD ID , NASA catalog number , USSPACECOM object number or simply catalog number and similar variants ) is a sequential five-digit number assigned by USSTRATCOM ( United States Strategic Command ) in order of discovery to all man-made objects in Earth orbit ( including rocket bodies and debris ) and space probes launched from Earth . The first catalogued object , catalog number 00001 , is the Sputnik 1 launch vehicle , with the Sputnik 1 satellite assigned catalog number 00002 . Objects that fail to orbit or orbit for a short time are not catalogued . The minimum object size in the catalog is 10 centimeters in diameter . , the catalog listed 44,336 objects including 8,558 satellites launched into orbit since 1957 . 17,480 of them were actively tracked while 1,335 were lost . ESA estimates there are about 34,000 orbiting debris of the size USSTRATCOM is capable to track as of January 2019 . USSTRATCOM shares the catalog via space-track.org website . 18th Space Control Squadron ( 18 SPCS ) is the unit that maintains the catalog .",
  "/wiki/International_Designator": "The International Designator , also known as COSPAR ID , and NSSDC ID , is an international identifier assigned to man-made objects in space . It consists of the launch year , a three-digit incrementing launch number of that year and up to a three-letter code representing the sequential identifier of a piece in a launch . In TLE format the first two digits of the year and the dash are dropped . For example , 1990-037A is the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-31 , which carried the Hubble Space Telescope ( 1990-037B ) into space . This launch was the 37th known successful launch worldwide in 1990 . The designation system has been generally known as the COSPAR system , named for the Committee on Space Research ( COSPAR ) of the International Council for Science . COSPAR subsumed the first designation system , devised at Harvard University in 1958 . That system used letters of the Greek alphabet to designate artificial satellites . For example , Sputnik 1 was designated 1957 Alpha 2 . The Harvard designation system continued to be used for satellites launched up to the end of 1962 , when it was replaced with the modern system . The first satellite to receive a new-format designator was Luna E-6 No.2 , 1963-001B , although some sources , including the NSSDC website , anachronistically apply the new-format designators to older satellites , even those no longer in orbit at the time of its introduction . Designators are assigned to objects by USSTRATCOM along with satellite catalog numbers as they are discovered in space .",
  "/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)": "In astronomy , an epoch is a moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity , such as the celestial coordinates or elliptical orbital elements of a celestial body , because these are subject to perturbations and vary with time . These time-varying astronomical quantities might include , for example , the mean longitude or mean anomaly of a body , the node of its orbit relative to a reference plane , the direction of the apogee or aphelion of its orbit , or the size of the major axis of its orbit . The main use of astronomical quantities specified in this way is to calculate other relevant parameters of motion , in order to predict future positions and velocities . The applied tools of the disciplines of celestial mechanics or its subfield orbital mechanics ( for predicting orbital paths and positions for bodies in motion under the gravitational effects of other bodies ) can be used to generate an ephemeris , a table of values giving the positions and velocities of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times . Astronomical quantities can be specified in any of several ways , for example , as a polynomial function of the time-interval , with an epoch as a temporal point of origin ( this is a common current way of using an epoch ) . Alternatively , the time-varying astronomical quantity can be expressed as a constant , equal to the measure that it had at the epoch , leaving its variation over time to be specified in some other way - for example , by a table , as was common during the 17th and 18th centuries . The word epoch was often used in a different way in older astronomical literature , e.g . during the 18th century , in connection with astronomical tables . At that time , it was customary to denote as epochs , not the standard date and time of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities , but rather the values at that date and time of those time-varying quantities themselves . In accordance with that alternative historical usage , an expression such as 'correcting the epochs ' would refer to the adjustment , usually by a small amount , of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard date and time of reference ( and not , as might be expected from current usage , to a change from one date and time of reference to a different date and time ) .",
  "/wiki/Mean_Motion": "In orbital mechanics , mean motion ( represented by n ) is the angular speed required for a body to complete one orbit , assuming constant speed in a circular orbit which completes in the same time as the variable speed , elliptical orbit of the actual body . The concept applies equally well to a small body revolving about a large , massive primary body or to two relatively same-sized bodies revolving about a common center of mass . While nominally a mean , and theoretically so in the case of two-body motion , in practice the mean motion is not typically an average over time for the orbits of real bodies , which only approximate the two-body assumption . It is rather the instantaneous value which satisfies the above conditions as calculated from the current gravitational and geometric circumstances of the body 's constantly-changing , perturbed orbit . Mean motion is used as an approximation of the actual orbital speed in making an initial calculation of the body 's position in its orbit , for instance , from a set of orbital elements . This mean position is refined by Kepler 's equation to produce the true position .",
  "/wiki/BSTAR": "BSTAR is a way of modeling aerodynamic drag on a satellite in the SGP4 satellite orbit propagation model . Traditionally , aerodynamic resistance ( drag ) is given by where formula_2 is the air density , formula_3 is the drag coefficient , formula_4 is the frontal area , and formula_5 is the velocity . The acceleration due to drag is then In aerodynamic theory , the factor is the inverse of the ballistic coefficient , and its unit is area per mass . Further incorporating a reference air density and the factor of two in the denominator , we get the starred ballistic coefficient : thus reducing the expression for the acceleration due to drag to As it can be seen , formula_10 has a unit of inverse length . For orbit propagation purposes , there is a field for BSTAR drag in Two-line element set ( TLE ) files , where it is to be given in units of inverse Earth radii . The corresponding reference air density is given as 0.1570 kg/m^2/Earth radii .",
  "/wiki/Checksum": "A checksum is a small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage . It is usually applied to an installation file after it is received from the download server . By themselves , checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity . The actual procedure which yields the checksum from a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm . Depending on its design goals , a good checksum algorithm will usually output a significantly different value , even for small changes made to the input . This is especially true of cryptographic hash functions , which may be used to detect many data corruption errors and verify overall data integrity ; if the computed checksum for the current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum , there is a very high probability the data has not been accidentally altered or corrupted . Checksum functions are related to hash functions , fingerprints , randomization functions , and cryptographic hash functions . However , each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals . For instance , a function returning the start of a string can provide a hash appropriate for some applications but will never be a suitable checksum . Checksums are used as cryptographic primitives in larger authentication algorithms . For cryptographic systems with these two specific design goals , see HMAC . Check digits and parity bits are special cases of checksums , appropriate for small blocks of data ( such as Social Security numbers , bank account numbers , computer words , single bytes , etc . ) .",
  "/wiki/Modulo_operation": "In computing , the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another ( called the modulus of the operation ) . Given two positive numbers , and , modulo ( abbreviated as ) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of by , where is the dividend and is the divisor . For example , the expression 5 mod 2 would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1 , while 9 mod 3 would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0 ; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3 . ( Doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation ; the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction . ) Although typically performed with and both being integers , many computing systems allow other types of numeric operands . The range of numbers for an integer modulo of is 0 to inclusive . ( mod 1 is always 0 ; is undefined , possibly resulting in a division by zero error in programming languages . ) See modular arithmetic for an older and related convention applied in number theory . When either or is negative , the naive definition breaks down and programming languages differ in how these values are defined ."
