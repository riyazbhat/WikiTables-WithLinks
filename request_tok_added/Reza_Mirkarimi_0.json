  "/wiki/Festival": "A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its religion or cultures . It is often marked as a local or national holiday , mela , or eid . A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization , as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship . Next to religion and folklore , a significant origin is agricultural . Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time . Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn , such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern . Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes , especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods and goddesses . Celebrations offer a sense of belonging for religious , social , or geographical groups , contributing to group cohesiveness . They may also provide entertainment , which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment . Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions ; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among families . In Ancient Greece and Rome , festivals such as the Saturnalia were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion . In modern times , festivals may be attended by strangers such as tourists , who are attracted to some of the more eccentric or historical ones .",
