  "/wiki/1996_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1996 NCAA Division I-A football season ended with the Florida Gators crowned National Champions , but not as unanimously as the Bowl Alliance would have hoped . Florida defeated Florida State in the Sugar Bowl , which was the designated National Championship that year . Florida had faced Florida State earlier in the year , when they were ranked # 1 and # 2 , and lost . Were it not for Texas beating Nebraska , then # 3 , in the first ever Big 12 Championship Game , Florida would n't have even been in the bowl game . And even once they were there , it was n't certain a victory would mean a national championship . The Rose Bowl game featured # 2 Arizona State and # 4 Ohio State . Florida St. and Arizona St. were the only unbeatens going into bowl season , so a Rose Bowl victory would give the Sun Devils a legitimate chance on winning the title . This scenario looked plausible as Arizona State 's Jake Plummer scored with 1:40 left to play in the game , making the score 17-14 . But Ohio State 's backup quarterback Joe Germaine marched down the field to pull out a heart stopping 20-17 win . On the one hand , this meant the national title game the following night would produce an incontrovertible champion . On the other hand , it left doubt to whether or not Ohio State deserved a stake in the national title , as evidenced by the team 's 1\u00bd first place votes in the final AP poll . The Pac-10 and Big Ten could no longer afford to hold on to tradition while the rest of the country wanted a clear national champion .",

The national championship was split for the third time in the 1990s . The Michigan Wolverines finished the season atop the AP Poll after completing a 12-0 campaign with a Big Ten Conference championship and a victory in the Rose Bowl over Washington State . The Nebraska Cornhuskers garnered the top ranking in the Coaches ' Poll with a 13-0 record , a Big 12 Conference championship , and a win over Tennessee in the Orange Bowl . Michigan 's Charles Woodson , who played primarily at cornerback , but also saw time on offense as a wide receiver and on special teams as a punt returner , won the Heisman Trophy , becoming the first primarily defensive player to win the award . The 1997 season was the third and final season in which the major bowl games were organized under the Bowl Alliance system . The Bowl Championship Series was instituted the following year . In Tom Osborne 's last season as head coach , Nebraska took over the # 1 ranking in the nation after defeating Texas Tech midway through the season . Three weeks later , despite winning at Missouri in an overtime game against an unranked Missouri football team , Nebraska slipped to a # 2 ranking in the polls , as voters were n't impressed by the way the Cornhuskers won the game ( a controversial kicked ball that was caught for the game-tying TD as time expired in regulation ) ; Michigan moved ahead of Nebraska after its 34-8 victory over # 3 ranked Penn State . The consensus # 1 team going into the bowl season was undefeated Michigan , ranked # 1 in both the AP and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll . Led by coach of the year Lloyd Carr and Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson , Michigan went into the 1998 Rose Bowl against # 8 Washington State . Michigan defeated Washington State 21-16 .",

It was the first season of the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) , which saw the Tennessee Volunteers win the national championship , one year after star quarterback Peyton Manning left for the National Football League ( NFL ) . Tennessee defeated the Florida State Seminoles , 23-16 , in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Arizona , to secure the inaugural BCS National Championship . The BCS combined elements of the old Bowl Coalition and the Bowl Alliance it replaced . The agreement existed between the Rose , Fiesta , Sugar , and Orange bowl games , with the Cotton Bowl Classic diminishing in status since the breakup of the Southwest Conference . Like the Bowl Alliance , a national championship game would rotate between the four bowls , with the top two teams facing each other . These teams were chosen based upon a BCS poll , combining the AP Poll , the Coaches Poll , and a computer component . The computer factored in things such as strength of schedule , margin of victory , and quality wins without taking into account time ( in other words , a loss early in the season and a loss late in the season were on equal footing ) . Like the Bowl Coalition , the BCS bowls not hosting the national championship game would retain their traditional conference tie-ins . The first run of the Bowl Championship Series was not without controversy as Kansas State finished third in the final BCS standings , but was not invited to a BCS bowl game . Ohio State ( ranked 4th ) and two-loss Florida ( 8th ) received the at-large bids instead .

Despite finishing undefeated , the Green Wave were not considered for a BCS game , let alone a berth in the 1999 Fiesta Bowl - that year 's national title game - because it was felt they had not played a difficult schedule . They did not play a single ranked team all season , and the only Automatic Qualifying conference member on their schedule was a Rutgers team that finished tied for sixth in the Big East . They defeated Brigham Young University in the Liberty Bowl . The Green Wave finished the season ranked seventh in the nation in both the AP Poll and Coaches ' Poll - in both cases , its highest rankings in school history since the 1939 Tulane football season when they were ranked No . 5 in the AP Poll .

Virginia Tech also had a remarkable season behind freshman quarterback Michael Vick , who was being touted as college football 's best player . Vick was outshined in the national championship game by Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick . Warrick had early problems with the law , charged with a misdemeanor he sat out two games early in the season . But he scored three touchdowns in the title game , earning MVP honors . The BCS adopted a new rule after the previous season , nicknamed the Kansas State Rule , which stated that any team ranked in the top four in the final BCS poll is assured of an invitation to a BCS bowl game . A lot of teams faced debacles . East Carolina faced Hurricane Floyd , and in that same week , faced the # 9 Miami Hurricanes .

Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops was in his second season as head coach , having been the defensive coordinator of Steve Spurrier 's 1996 National Champion Florida Gators , and also having helped Bill Snyder turn the Kansas State Wildcats around in the early 1990s . Stoops erased a three-game losing streak against rival Texas by a score of 63-14 , one of the worst defeats in Texas ' football history . Despite the lopsided victory , this game marked a return of the Red River Shootout to a rivalry game with national title implications .

Virginia Tech also was left out of the BCS bowls , despite being ranked higher than one of the at-large teams , Notre Dame .

Coker had the benefit of inheriting a star-studded program that Davis had rebuilt in the aftermath of NCAA sanctions in the mid-to-late '90s . Miami completed a perfect 12-0 season , which culminated in a 37-14 win over Nebraska in the Rose Bowl BCS National Championship Game . In yet another controversial season for the BCS , ( AP ) # 4 Nebraska was chosen as the national title opponent despite not having even played in the Big 12 championship game . The Huskers went into their last regularly scheduled game at Colorado undefeated , but left Boulder having lost the game by a score of 62-36 .
