Ramachandran ( MGR ) , the ADMK founder and a leading Tamil film actor , was sworn in as Chief Minister for the first time . The election was a four cornered contest between the ADMK , DMK , the Indian National Congress ( INC ) and the Janata Party . Earlier in 1972 , MGR had founded the ADMK following his expulsion from the DMK after differences arose between him and DMK leader M. Karunanidhi . On 31 January 1976 , Karunanidhi 's government was dismissed by the central government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi citing non co-operation for MISA and President 's rule was imposed on the state . Karunanidhi had been at odds with Indira Gandhi over his opposition to Emergency and allied with Janata Party founded by Jayaprakash Narayan . Meanwhile , MGR had developed a close relationship with Indira Gandhi and supported the Emergency . MGR remained as Chief Minister until his death in 1987 , winning the next two elections held in 1980 and 1984.This election gave concrete proof that Tamil people idolised MGR , as he won the State elections in allaince with Indira 's Congress , despite the people hating Indira for implementing Emergency . Due to this feat , MGR inadvertently became an example for entry of famous actors to enter politics , with a hope that they too may become Chief minister one day . then Telugu superstar NTR followed MGR 's suit in 1983 and won the Andhrapradesh general Elections to become the Chief minister of Andhrapradesh . Since then , no other actor has been able to recreate MGRs achievements in electoral Politics .",
