  "/wiki/Humanity_(The_Mad_Capsule_Markets_album)": "Humanity is the debut album from Japanese hardcore punk group The Mad Capsule Markets . They later re-released the album in 1996 , and this was the only full album that guitarist Minoru Kojima played on . This album contains the original version of the songs San Byoukan no Jisatsu and Life Game , which both appear in censored form on the album P.O.P . The original version of San Byoukan no Jisatsu contains an extra line in the chorus about jumping off a building . It was never made certain why the line was removed on P.O.P , but it was speculated that the song was linked to Japanese teen suicide , and therefore censored on P.O.P and has been totally silenced on the re-release of Humanity and releases thereafter . The band or record company would later erase any further reference of it from on the insert for the re-release of Humanity also , as the word Jisatsu ( suicide ) on the track list has been scribbled out . The original pressing of the album came with a free newspaper clipping , which had lyrics and photos of the band . The lyrics where otherwise later reprinted in P.O.P or the re-released version of the album .",
