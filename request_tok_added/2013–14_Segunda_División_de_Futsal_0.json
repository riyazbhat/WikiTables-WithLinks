Galicia is bordered by Portugal to the south , the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n and Asturias to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Cantabrian Sea to the north . It had a population of 2,701,743 in 2018 and a total area of 29,574 km2 ( 11,419 sq mi ) .

The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period , and takes its name from the Gallaeci , the Celtic people living north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC . Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC , and was made a Roman province in the 3rd century AD . In 410 , the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga ( Portugal ) ; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585 . In 711 , the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the Visigoth kingdom of Hispania by 718 , but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740 . During the Middle Ages , the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings , but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture . From the 13th century on , the kings of Castile , as kings of Galicia , appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r , whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century . The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia , a royal tribunal and government body .",
