  "/wiki/British_Rail": "British Railways ( BR ) , which from 1965 traded as British Rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997 . It was formed from the nationalisation of the Big Four British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board . The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . A process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ) . Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . On privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . The British Rail double arrow logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision . It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the Rail Delivery Group 's ( RDG ) jointly-managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .",
  "/wiki/0-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-6-0 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels , six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels . This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders . In the United Kingdom , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification , popular in Europe , this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears , or Co if they are independently driven , the latter usually being electric and diesel-electric locomotives .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_locomotive": "A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a diesel engine . Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed , differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels . Early internal combustion locomotives and railcars used kerosene and gasoline as their fuel . Rudolf Diesel patented his first compression ignition engine in 1898 , and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive . Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited torque range , and while low power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical transmissions , the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission . This is because clutches would need to be very large at these power levels and would not fit in a standard 2.5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) -wide locomotive frame , or wear too quickly to be useful . The first successful diesel engines used diesel-electric transmissions , and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of 600 hp ( 450 kW ) were in service in the United States . In 1930 , Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) locomotives using Sulzer-designed engines to Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway of Argentina . In 1933 , diesel-electric technology developed by Maybach was used to propel the DRG Class SVT 877 , a high-speed intercity two-car set , and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935 . In the United States , diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934 , largely through the research and development efforts of General Motors dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the Budd Company . The economic recovery from World War II caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries . They offered greater flexibility and performance than steam locomotives , as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs .",
  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_03": "The British Rail Class 03 locomotive was , together with the similar Class 04 , one of British Railways ' most successful 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunters . Two hundred and thirty were built at Doncaster and Swindon works between 1957 and 1962 , and were numbered D2000-D2199 and D2370-D2399 ( later 03004 to 03399 ) . D2370 and D2371 were used as departmental locomotives and originally numbered 91 and 92 respectively .",
  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_04": "The British Rail Class 04 was a 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunting locomotive class , built between 1952 and 1962 and was the basis for the later Class 03 built in the British Railways workshops . However , the first locomotive to be built to the design was actually DS1173 , in 1948 , which served as a departmental shunter at Hither Green depot , before being transferred to the capital stock list as D2341 in 1967 . The Class 04 locomotives were supplied by the Drewry Car Co. , which at the time ( and for most of its existence ) had no manufacturing capability . Drewry sub-contracted the construction work to two builders both of whom built other locomotives under the same arrangement . Early locomotives ( including DS1173 ) were built by Vulcan Foundry and later examples were built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns .",
  "/wiki/Co-Co_locomotives": "Co-Co is the wheel arrangement for a diesel locomotive with two six-wheeled bogies with all axles powered , with a separate traction motor per axle . The equivalent UIC classification ( Europe ) for this arrangement is Co\u2032Co\u2032 or C-C for AAR ( USA ) .",
  "/wiki/British_Rail_Class_31": "The British Rail Class 31 diesel locomotives , also known as the Brush Type 2 and originally as Class 30 , were built by Brush Traction from 1957-62 . They were numbered in two series , D5500-D5699 and D5800-D5862 ."
