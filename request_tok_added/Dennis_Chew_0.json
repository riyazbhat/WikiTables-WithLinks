  "/wiki/The_Ghosts_Must_Be_Crazy": "The Ghosts Must Be Crazy ( ) is a 2011 Singaporean comedy horror film directed by Mark Lee and Boris Boo . It was released on 6 January 2011 The movie content was split into two stories , one about taking a day-off in the army , and one about a ghost bride 's marriage . The movie also featured some cast members from Where Got Ghost ? . PART 1 : Only ghost will give you off - \u9b3c\u624d\u7d66\u4f60OFF ( Day-Off ) Sometime in the 1990s , late at night , two soldiers ( played by Suhaimi Yusof and Khariudin Samsuddin ) dig a shellscrape during a military exercise , encountering human hair buried in the ground . Attempting to pull it out of the dirt , the duo encounters a female ghost standing behind , which later apparently frightened them to death . Moving forward to the present-day , two reservist soldiers , Ah Nan ( John Cheng ) and Ah Lei , tries to get their on-the-ball commander , Lieutenant Chua ( Chua En Lai ) , to grant them a day-off during their last unit exercise including stories about the female ghost by Ah Nan and telling that Ah Lei 's grandmother passes away , which fails comically . Another soldier , Ah Tan ( Dennis Chew ) , comes to see Lieutenant Chua to get a day-off or light duty too , citing ill health ( he suffered for internal injuries ) , but gets rejected as well . Since the beginning , Ah Nan and Ah Lei did n't believe that Ah Tan felt ill , instead thinking that Ah Tan acted to get a day-off , including Ah Nan betting that Ah Tan will get rejected by Lieutenant Chua for a day-off or chop off his head . Ah Nan and Ah Lei encounters their Sergeant-Major , Warrant Officer Muthu ( David Bala ) , after leaving the commanders office while chasing Ah Tan , who demands that Ah Lei ( who dyed his hair yellow ) either shave his head or get his hair dyed back to black . Later , during a chat with other reservist mates , it is revealed that Muthu had apparently died in a terrible car accident sometime back with his head knocked off , unsettling both Ah Nan and Ah Lei ( it is later revealed that it was nothing more than a prank on the two by their fellow soldiers at a briefing before the exercise ) . During the exercise , Ah Tan , who is still sick , cooks his traditional Chinese medicine while he , Ah Nan and Ah Lei dig a fire-trench ( only Ah Tan dig the fire-trench while the other two are cooking their meals ) . When Muthu comes to inspect their progress , he notices Ah Tans medicine cooking and , citing a real wartime scenario , naggingly scolds the three soldiers for inadvertently exposing themselves to enemy fire by cooking in the field .",
