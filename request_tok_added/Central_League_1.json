  "/wiki/Pennant_(sports)": "A pennant is a commemorative flag typically used to show support for a particular athletic team . Pennants have been historically used in all types of athletic levels : high school , collegiate , professional etc . Traditionally , pennants were made of felt and fashioned in the official colors of a particular team . Often graphics , usually the mascot symbol , as well as the team name were displayed on pennants . The images displayed on pennants were either stitched on with contrasting colored felt or had screen-printing . Today , vintage pennants with rare images or honoring special victories have become prized collectibles for sporting enthusiasts . While pennants are typically associated with athletic teams , pennants have also been made to honor institutions and vacation spots , often acting as souvenirs . New pennants are made of stretched canvas over a wood frame and are used for every youth sport award and recognition . In addition the pennant is a popular branding item .",
