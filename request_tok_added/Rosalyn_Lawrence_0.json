  "/wiki/Kanupark_Markkleeberg": "Kanupark Markkleeberg , built in 2006 , is the second of two artificial whitewater canoe/kayak slalom courses in Germany , and the only one powered by pumps . The other German course is the Eiskanal in Augsburg , used in the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich . Kanupark Markkleeberg is located on the southeast shore of Markkleeberger See , a lake south of Markkleeberg , a suburb on the south side of Leipzig . A former open-pit coal mine , the lake was flooded in 1999 with groundwater and developed as a water recreation area . The lake is part of the Leipziger Neuseenland , the largest landscape construction project in Europe , which is reclaiming formerly barren industrial and mining sites for recreational use . The whitewater park was planned as part of Leipzig 's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics , which were ultimately awarded to London . It was completed in time to serve as a training facility for the 2008 Beijing Olympics . With movable plastic bollards serving as water diversion features , it was possible to rig the competition course to be a close duplicate of the one at Beijing 's Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park . Since formally opening in April 2007 , the state-of-the-art Kanupark has hosted a full schedule of regional and international competitions . In 2010 it hosted the Junior and Under-23 European Championships . Kanupark Markkleeberg has two courses which loop in opposite directions from the pump house . Each loop has its own conveyor-belt boat lift .",

The competition whitewater course is 300 m long , with a 6.5 m drop , making a 2.2% slope of 114 ft/mile or 22 m/km . The natural flow of the Segre River is diverted through the course by a diversion dam upstream . In low flow conditions , four 300-kilowatt recirculation pumps can add up to 12 m\u00b3/s to the course flow , in order to increase it to the course maximum of 17.5 m\u00b3/s . When the course is not being used , or when the natural flow exceeds 17.5 m\u00b3/s , the pumps are reversed and run in turbine mode to generate electricity for the town . A 130-metre beginners course is a diversion from the main course . Its drop is 1.5 m for a 1.2% slope of 61 ft/mile or 12 m/km . Streamflow for the beginners course is 3 to 10 m\u00b3/s . The park also has a 650-m long feedwater canal which carries water from the river into the whitewater course . This canal is used for flatwater canoe and kayak training and competition .

  "/wiki/Augsburg_Eiskanal": "The Augsburg Eiskanal is an artificial whitewater river in Augsburg , Germany , constructed as the canoe slalom venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics in nearby Munich . The first artificial whitewater course of its kind , it introduced the sport of canoe slalom ( using decked canoes and kayaks ) to the Olympic Games . However , because of the expense of building artificial rivers and supplying them with water , canoe slalom was missing from the next four Summer Olympics . It returned with the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona , and has been featured in every Summer Olympics since then . The Eiskanal has thus served as the prototype for six Olympic whitewater venues , from 1992 through 2012 , and for more than fifty training and competition facilities in eighteen countries ( see list ) . Despite being the oldest , it is still one of the most widely used , hosting two World Championships and numerous World Cup races .
