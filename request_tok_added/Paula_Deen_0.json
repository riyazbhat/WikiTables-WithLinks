  "/wiki/Paula's_Home_Cooking": "Paula 's Home Cooking is a Food Network show hosted by Paula Deen . Deen 's primary culinary focus was Southern cuisine and familiar comfort food that is popular with Americans . In the show , classic dishes such as pot roast , fried okra , fried chicken and pecan pie were the norm , and overcomplicated or eccentric recipes were usually eschewed . Dishes that are flavorful and familiar were spotlighted , although the fat content and calorie count of the meals were often very high . Paula also showed off vignettes of Savannah , Georgia , where she co-owns with her sons Jamie and Bobby , The Lady & Sons . Deen 's popularity , spurred by the show , led to a small role in the feature film Elizabethtown . Despite its seemingly Southern atmosphere , Paula 's Home Cooking was taped in upstate New York until 2006 ; since then , shows had been taped at Deen 's new home near Savannah . In 2008 , Deen began work on a revamped version of the series called Paula 's Best Dishes , in which friends and family join her in the kitchen to prepare recipes . Deen 's sons often appeared as guests on the show . They too proved to be popular among Food Network 's audience and now have their own show , Road Tasted , similar to Rachael Ray 's Tasty Travels . Deen 's husband , Michael Groover , also appeared sporadically as a guest , and Food Network taped the Deen-Groover wedding in 2004 as a special edition of the show . The success of Paula 's Home Cooking led to a line of cookbooks , a magazine , other television shows and specials , and related merchandise .",
