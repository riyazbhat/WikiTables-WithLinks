The city is the sixth-largest in France , with a population of 303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants . With Saint-Nazaire , a seaport on the Loire estuary , Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis . It is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion , one of 18 regions of France . Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany , a former duchy and province , and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial . Nantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire . It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851 . Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany , Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France . During the 17th century , after the establishment of the French colonial empire , Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the 18th-century French Atlantic slave trade . The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline , but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 ( chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing ) . Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy . In 2012 , the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city .",
