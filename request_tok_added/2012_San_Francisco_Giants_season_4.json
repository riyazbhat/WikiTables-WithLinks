  "/wiki/Win_(baseball)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",

  "/wiki/Winning_percentage": "In sports , a winning percentage is the fraction of games or matches a team or individual has won . It is defined as wins divided by the total number of matches played ( i.e . wins plus draws plus losses ) . A draw counts as a \u200b1\u20442 win . For example , if a team 's season record is 30 wins and 20 losses , the winning percentage would be 60% or 0.600 . If a team 's season record is 30-15-5 ( i.e . it has won thirty games , lost fifteen and tied five times ) , the five tie games are counted as 2\u200b1\u20442 wins , and so the team has an adjusted record of 32\u200b1\u20442 wins , resulting in a 65% or .650 winning percentage for the fifty total games from",
