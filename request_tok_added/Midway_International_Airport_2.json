  "/wiki/Billy_Bishop_Toronto_City_Airport": "Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport ( IATA : YTZ , ICAO : CYTZ ) is a regional airport located on the Toronto Islands in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . The airport is often referred to as Toronto Island Airport and was previously known as Port George VI Island Airport and Toronto City Centre Airport . The airport 's name honours Billy Bishop , the Canadian World War I flying ace and World War II Air Marshal . It is used by civil aviation , air ambulances , and regional airlines using turboprop planes . In 2018 , it was ranked Canada 's ninth-busiest airport , and the sixth-busiest Canadian airport that serves the U.S . Conceived in the 1930s as the main airport for Toronto , the construction of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission ( THC ) . At the same time , the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate , but nearby Malton ( today Toronto Pearson International Airport ) became Toronto 's main passenger airline hub instead , leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes . During the 1940s and 1950s , several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs . Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport . After the expansion , civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s . Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s , the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed . In 1983 , a 50-year tripartite agreement between the Government of Canada , the City of Toronto government and the Harbour Commission , which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines , allowed airport operations to continue .",
