  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",
  "/wiki/Rice": "Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa ( Asian rice ) or Oryza glaberrima ( African rice ) . As a cereal grain , it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world 's human population , especially in Asia . It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production ( rice , 741.5 million tonnes in 2014 ) , after sugarcane ( 1.9 billion tonnes ) and maize ( 1.0 billion tonnes ) .",
  "/wiki/Maize": "Maize ( /me\u026az/ MAYZ ; Zea mays subsp . mays , from Spanish : ma\u00edz after Taino : mahiz ) , also known as corn , is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago . The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds , which are fruits . Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world , with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice . However , little of this maize is consumed directly by humans : most is used for corn ethanol , animal feed and other maize products , such as corn starch and corn syrup . The six major types of maize are dent corn , flint corn , pod corn , popcorn , flour corn , and sweet corn . Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels , while field corn varieties are used for animal feed , various corn-based human food uses ( including grinding into cornmeal or masa , pressing into corn oil , and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey ) , and as chemical feedstocks . Maize is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels . Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world , and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain . In 2014 , total world production was 1.04 billion tonnes . Maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas , with 361 million metric tons grown in the United States in 2014 . Approximately 40% of the crop - 130 million tons - is used for corn ethanol .",
  "/wiki/Cassava": "Manihot esculenta , commonly called cassava ( ) , manioc , yuca , macaxeira , mandioca , kappa kizhangu and aipim , is a woody shrub native to South America of the spurge family , Euphorbiaceae . Although a perennial plant , cassava is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root , a major source of carbohydrates . Though it is often called yuca in Spanish America and in the United States , it is not related to yucca , a shrub in the family Asparagaceae . Cassava is predominantly consumed in boiled form , but substantial quantities are used to extract cassava starch , called tapioca , which is used for food , animal feed , and industrial purposes . The Brazilian farinha , and the related garri of West Africa , is an edible coarse flour obtained by grating cassava roots , pressing moisture off the obtained grated pulp , and finally drying it ( and roasting in the case of farinha ) . Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics , after rice and maize . Cassava is a major staple food in the developing world , providing a basic diet for over half a billion people . It is one of the most drought-tolerant crops , capable of growing on marginal soils . Nigeria is the world 's largest producer of cassava , while Thailand is the largest exporter of cassava starch . Cassava is classified as either sweet or bitter . Like other roots and tubers , both bitter and sweet varieties of cassava contain antinutritional factors and toxins , with the bitter varieties containing much larger amounts . It must be properly prepared before consumption , as improper preparation of cassava can leave enough residual cyanide to cause acute cyanide intoxication , goiters , and even ataxia , partial paralysis , or death .",
  "/wiki/Banana": "A banana is an edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa . In some countries , bananas used for cooking may be called plantains , distinguishing them from dessert bananas . The fruit is variable in size , color , and firmness , but is usually elongated and curved , with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind , which may be green , yellow , red , purple , or brown when ripe . The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant . Almost all modern edible seedless ( parthenocarp ) bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana . The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata , Musa balbisiana , and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M. balbisiana , depending on their genomic constitution . The old scientific name for this hybrid , Musa sapientum , is no longer used . Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia , and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea . They are grown in 135 countries , primarily for their fruit , and to a lesser extent to make fiber , banana wine , and banana beer and as ornamental plants . The world 's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China , which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production . Worldwide , there is no sharp distinction between bananas and plantains . Especially in the Americas and Europe , banana usually refers to soft , sweet , dessert bananas , particularly those of the Cavendish group , which are the main exports from banana-growing countries .",
  "/wiki/Sugarcane": "Sugarcane , or sugar cane , or simply cane , are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum , tribe Andropogoneae , used for sugar production . The plant is two to six metres ( six to twenty feet ) tall . It has stout , jointed , fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose , a simple sugar which accumulates in the stalk internodes . Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae , an economically important seed plant family that includes maize , wheat , rice , and sorghum , and many forage crops . It is native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia , Southeast Asia , New Guinea , and South America . The global demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture . Sugarcane is the world 's largest crop by production quantity , with 1.9 billion tonnes produced in 2015 , with Brazil accounting for 41% of the world total . In 2012 , the Food and Agriculture Organization estimated it was cultivated on about , in more than 90 countries . All sugar cane species can interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids . About 70% of the sugar produced globally comes from a species of sugarcane called Saccharum officinarum and hybrids using this species . Sugarcane accounts for 79% of sugar produced ; most of the rest is made from sugar beets . While sugarcane predominantly grows in tropical and subtropical regions , sugar beets typically grow in colder temperate regions .",
  "/wiki/Ethanol": "Ethanol ( also called ethyl alcohol , grain alcohol , drinking alcohol , or simply alcohol ) is a chemical compound , a simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H6O . Its formula can be also written as CH3\u2212CH2\u2212OH or C2H5OH ( an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group ) , and is often abbreviated as EtOH . Ethanol is a volatile , flammable , colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor . It is a psychoactive substance and is the principal active ingredient found in alcoholic drinks . Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes , and is commonly consumed as a popular recreational drug . It also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant . The compound is widely used as a chemical solvent , either for scientific chemical testing or in synthesis of other organic compounds , and is a vital substance used across many different kinds of manufacturing industries . Ethanol is also used as an alternative fuel source .",
  "/wiki/Coffea": "Coffea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae . Coffea species are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa and tropical Asia . The seeds of some species , called coffee beans , are used to flavor various beverages and products . The fruits , like the seeds , contain a large amount of caffeine , and have a distinct sweet taste and are often juiced . The plant ranks as one of the world 's most valuable and widely traded commodity crops and is an important export product of several countries , including those in Central and South America , the Caribbean and Africa .",
  "/wiki/Cocoa_bean": "The cocoa bean or simply cocoa ( ) , which is also called the cacao bean or cacao ( ) , is the dried and fully fermented seed of Theobroma cacao , from which cocoa solids ( a mixture of nonfat substances ) and cocoa butter ( the fat ) can be extracted .

  "/wiki/Lemon": "The lemon , Citrus limon ( L. ) Osbeck , is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae , native to South Asia , primarily North eastern India . The tree 's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world , primarily for its juice , which has both culinary and cleaning uses . The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking . The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid , with a pH of around 2.2 , giving it a sour taste . The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie .",
  "/wiki/Coca": "Coca is any of the four cultivated plants in the family Erythroxylaceae , native to western South America . The plant is grown as a cash crop in Argentine Northwest , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru , even in areas where its cultivation is unlawful . There are some reports that the plant is being cultivated in the south of Mexico as an alternative to smuggling its recreational product cocaine . It also plays a role in many traditional Andean cultures as well as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta ( see Traditional uses ) . Coca is known throughout the world for its psychoactive alkaloid , cocaine . The alkaloid content of coca leaves is relatively low , between 0.25% and 0.77% . The native people use it as a stimulant . Coca-Cola used coca leaf extract in its products from 1885 and until about 1903 . Extraction of cocaine from coca requires several solvents and a chemical process known as an acid-base extraction , which can fairly easily extract the alkaloids from the plant .",
