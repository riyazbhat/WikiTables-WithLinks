He was the first Suffect Consul of Rome and was also the father of Lucretia , whose rape by Sextus Tarquinius , followed by her suicide , resulted in the dethronement of King Lucius Tarquinius Superbus , therefore directly precipitating the founding of the Roman Republic .

  "/wiki/Publius_Postumius_Tubertus": "Publius Postumius Tubertus , the son of Quintus , was the first of the patrician gens Postumia to obtain the consulship , which he held in 505 BC , the fifth year of the Roman Republic . Together with his colleague , Marcus Valerius Volusus , he fought against the Sabines , whom they defeated decisively near Tibur , obtaining a triumph . Postumius was consul for the second time in 503 BC . Livius records that he fought and defeated the Aurunci and the town of Pometia , obtaining a second triumph . Other authorities state that he fought against the Sabines again , at first with little success , but that he was eventually victorious , and was awarded an Ovation , or lesser triumph , which he celebrated on 3 April 503 BC . This was the first occasion that this honour was bestowed upon a magistrate of the Roman Republic . In 494 BC , Postumius was one of ten ambassadors sent by the Senate to treat with the plebs gathered on the Mons Sacer during the first secession . The envoys successfully negotiated to forgive some of the debt owed by the plebs and established the office of the Tribuni Plebis , or Tribunes of the People , who received the power to veto acts of the Magistrates and the Senate . In consequence of his deeds and reputation , Postumius and his descendants were accorded the privilege of being buried within the city walls .",
  "/wiki/Agrippa_Menenius_Lanatus_(consul_503_BC)": "Agrippa Menenius Lanatus ( died 493 BC ) , sometimes called Menenius Agrippa , was a consul of the Roman Republic in 503 BC , with Publius Postumius Tubertus . He was victorious over the Sabines and was awarded a triumph which he celebrated on 4 April , 503 BC . According to Livy , he also led Roman troops against the Latin town of Pometia . According to Livy , writing five hundred years after the fact , Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession . Livy says that Menenius told the soldiers a fable about the parts of the human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body . The rest of the body thought the stomach was getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach . Soon , the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they were nothing without it . In the story , the stomach represents the patrician class and the other body parts represent the plebs . Eventually , Livy says , an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs , which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs . It is not improbable that Saint Paul , an educated Roman citizen , knew this story ( not necessarily through Livy ) and was prompted by it in his use of the same parable when he admonished the Christians of Corinth that , for all their diversity of gifts , they were all members of one body ( I Cor . 12 : 13 ff ) . However , the imagery was not new , even for Livy .",
  "/wiki/Opiter_Verginius_Tricostus_(consul_502_BC)": "Opiter Verginius Tricostus served as consul of the early Roman Republic in 502 BC , with Spurius Cassius Viscellinus . He was the first from the powerful Verginia family to obtain the consulship . Together with his colleague Spurius Cassius Viscellinus , Verginius Tricostus fought against the Aurunci , and took Pometia . Livy also says that the consuls celebrated a triumph for their victory , however the Fasti Triumphales record only one triumph , by Cassius . The filiation of a number of consular men in the following generation suggests they were Opiter Verginius ' sons . They are : Proculus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus ( consul 486 BC ) , Titus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus ( consul 479 BC ) , Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus ( consul 478 BC ) and Aulus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus ( consul 476 BC ) .",

The year following his last consulship , he was accused of aiming at regal power , and was put to death by the patricians .",
  "/wiki/Postumus_Cominius_Auruncus": "Postumus Cominius Auruncus was a two-time consul of the early Roman Republic . In 501 BC , Cominius was consul with Titus Lartius , who Livy says was appointed as the first dictator of Rome . Other sources indicate the beginnings of hostilities with the Latins and a conspiracy among slaves during their term . As the consuls of 493 BC , Cominius and Spurius Cassius Viscellinus were elected towards the end of the First secessio plebis in 494 BC . They also conducted a census . Cominius achieved a military victory against the Volsci . He initially defeated a force from the town of Antium , then took the towns of Longula ( to the north of Antium ) and Pollusca . He laid siege to the town of Corioli and despite being attacked by a second force of Volsci from Antium , he achieved victory through the distinguished actions of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus , and captured Corioli . In 488 , he was among the envoys ( legati ) , all of consular rank , sent to Coriolanus . A puzzling and textually incomplete passage in Festus lists Cominius among several men who were burned publicly near the Circus Maximus in 486 BC . Valerius Maximus says that a tribune of the plebs burned nine colleagues for conspiring with Spurius Cassius Vicellinus , a consul in this year who plotted to make himself king . Since the plebeian tribunes numbered ten only much later , and since the listed names indicate that the men were of consular rank and patrician status , this incident during the Volscian Wars remains mysterious .",
