  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

It is the only state located in the Pacific Ocean and the only state composed entirely of islands . The state encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago , 137 islands spread over 1,500 miles ( 2,400 km ) . The volcanic archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania . At the southeastern end of the archipelago , the eight main islands are , in order from northwest to southeast : Ni\u02bbihau , Kaua\u02bbi , O\u02bbahu , Moloka\u02bbi , L\u0101na\u02bbi , Kaho\u02bbolawe , Maui , and Hawai\u02bbi . The last is the largest island in the group ; it is often called the Big Island or Hawai\u02bbi Island to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago . Hawai\u02bbi is the 8th-smallest geographically and the 11th-least populous , but the 13th-most densely populated of the 50 states . It is the only state with an Asian American plurality . Hawaii has more than 1.4 million permanent residents , along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel . The state capital and largest city is Honolulu on the island of O\u02bbahu . The state 's ocean coastline is about 750 miles ( 1,210 km ) long , the fourth longest in the U.S. , after the coastlines of Alaska , Florida , and California .

Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west , New Caledonia to the southwest , New Zealand 's Kermadec Islands to the southeast , Tonga to the east , the Samoas and France 's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast , and Tuvalu to the north . Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands - of which 110 are permanently inhabited - and more than 500 islets , amounting to a total land area of about 18,300 square kilometres ( 7,100 sq mi ) . The most outlying island is Ono-i-Lau . The two major islands , Viti Levu and Vanua Levu , account for 87% of the total population of 883,483 . The capital , Suva , on Viti Levu , serves as the country 's principal cruise-ship port . [ failed verification ] About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu 's coasts , either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi - where tourism is the major local industry - or Lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount . Due to its terrain , the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited . The majority of Fiji 's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago . Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",

The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago , which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands ( part of Papua New Guinea ) , but excludes outlying islands , such as Rennell and Bellona , and the Santa Cruz Islands . In 1568 , the Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to visit them , naming them the Islas Salom\u00f3n . Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893 , when Captain Gibson R.N. , of HMS Curacoa , declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate . During World War II , the Solomon Islands campaign ( 1942-1945 ) saw fierce fighting between the United States and the Empire of Japan , such as in the Battle of Guadalcanal . The official name of the then British administration was changed from the British Solomon Islands Protectorate to the Solomon Islands in 1975 , and self-government was achieved the following year . Independence was obtained , and the name changed to just Solomon Islands ( without the definite article ) , in 1978 . At independence , Solomon Islands became a constitutional monarchy .

The archipelago , which is of volcanic origin , is 1,750 kilometres ( 1,090 mi ) east of northern Australia , 540 kilometres ( 340 mi ) northeast of New Caledonia , east of New Guinea , southeast of the Solomon Islands , and west of Fiji . Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people . The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s , who arrived on the largest island , Esp\u00edritu Santo , in 1606 . Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium . An independence movement arose in the 1970s , and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980 .

  "/wiki/Tuvalu": "Tuvalu ( /tu\u02d0\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0lu\u02d0/ too-VAH-loo ) ( formerly known as the Ellice Islands ) , is a country in Polynesia , located in the Pacific Ocean , situated in Oceania and about midway between Hawaii and Australia . The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean ."
