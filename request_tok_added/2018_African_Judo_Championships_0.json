He competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the men 's 81 kg event , in which he was eliminated by Khasan Khalmurzaev in the third round . At the Tokyo 2019 World Judo Championship , Mohamed Abdelaal lost in the semi-finals to Israeli Sagi Muki , who went on to win the gold medal after defeating Belgium 's Matthias Casse in the men 's under 81-kg class . After losing his bout , Abdelaal refused to shake his Israeli opponent 's hand . Instead of bowing to his opponent and shaking his hand , as is customary in judo following a match , Abdelaal instead turned abruptly and walked away with his head down . Abdelaal 's poor sportsmanship was reminiscent of the 2016 Rio Olympics , where Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby was reprimanded by the International Olympic Committee and sent home from Brazil after refusing to shake the hand of his Israeli opponent , Or Sasson , at the end of their bout in which the Israeli defeated him . Their refusal to shake hands with Israeli opponents had precedent , in actions by another member of Egypt 's team . Egyptian judoka Ramadan Darwish had refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent Arik Zeevi , another Israeli Olympic bronze medalist , in both the 2011 Judo Grand Slam and the 2012 Judo Grand Prix .",
