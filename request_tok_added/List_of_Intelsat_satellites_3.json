  "/wiki/Ariane_4": "The Ariane 4 was an expendable launch system , designed by the Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales ( CNES ) while being manufactured by ArianeGroup and marketed by Arianespace . Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight , which was performed on 15 February 2003 , it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 launches to have been conducted . In 1982 , the Ariane 4 programme was approved by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . Drawing heavily upon the preceding Ariane 3 , it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of the Ariane family . The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing technologies used , as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos ; this approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members , who funded and participated in its development and operation . Capable of being equipped with a wide variety of strap-on boosters , the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an extremely versatile launcher . [ not verified in body ] Once in service , the launcher soon became recognised for being ideal for launching communications and Earth observation satellites , as well as those used for scientific research . During its working life , the Ariane 4 managed to capture 50 per cent of the market in launching commercial satellites , soundly demonstrating Europe 's ability to compete in the commercial launch sector . In February 2003 , the final Ariane 4 was launched ; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5 , which effectively replaced it in service .",

  "/wiki/PanAmSat": "The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold ( Rene ) Anselmo , was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich , Connecticut . It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry , news agencies , internet service providers , government agencies , and telecommunication companies . Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal , a communications lawyer in Washington , D.C. , to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network ( SIN ) , the current-day Univision . Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal 's law firm , hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice , filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace . PanAmSat effectively broke the monopoly on international satellite communications which was held by Intelsat , an international treaty-based organization founded and owned by several countries including the United States . PanAmSat , led by Anselmo , successfully lobbied the United States Congress to permit it to operate globally , competing against Intelsat . Univision would also gain a nationwide cable audience through PanAmSat 's efforts , gaining a head start in Spanish-language television in the United States and remaining the # 1 Spanish network to this day . Following the death of Rene Anselmo in 1995 , his widow Mary Anselmo controlled the company for a time . PanAmSat was sold to Hughes Electronics , a division of General Motors , in a $ 3 billion cash and stock deal . The satellite operations continued to be under PanAmSat with Hughes being the majority shareholder . In May 1997 , Hughes Communication Galaxy merged with PanAmSat , adding 9 more satellites to its fleet . In 2003 , News Corporation purchased Hughes Electronic 's PanAmSat division and on April 24 , 2004 sold PanAmSat to a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
