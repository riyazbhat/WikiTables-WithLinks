It was named after Hyde Road , a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in Ardwick and runs east towards Hyde . At the boundary between Gorton and Denton it continues as Manchester Road . Before its use as a football ground , the site was an area of waste ground , and in its early days the ground had only rudimentary facilities . The first stand was built in 1888 , but the ground had no changing facilities until 1896 ; players had to change in a nearby public house , the Hyde Road Hotel . By 1904 the ground had developed into a 40,000-capacity venue , hosting an FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and The Wednesday the following year . The stands and terraces were arranged in a haphazard manner due to space constraints , and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue . A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920 , when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire . Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923 , and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward . One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century , a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay , a stadium in Halifax .",

  "/wiki/Own_goal": "An own goal is an event in competitive goal-scoring sports ( such as association football or hockey ) where a player scores on his or her own side of the playing area rather than the one defended by the opponent . Since own goals are often added to the opponent 's score , they are often an embarrassing blunder for the scoring player , but in certain sports are occasionally done for strategic reasons . In some parts of the world , the term has become a metaphor for any action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it , sometimes even carrying a sense of poetic justice . During The Troubles , for instance , it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in Belfast , referring to an IED ( improvised explosive device ) that detonated prematurely , killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others . A player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal . Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play ."
