Triple-A teams are typically located in large metropolitan areas that do not have Major League Baseball teams , such as San Antonio ; Austin ; Columbus ; and Indianapolis . Interleague play between the International League and Pacific Coast League occurs twice each season . In July , each league 's All-Star team competes in the Triple-A All-Star Game . In September each league 's regular season champions play each other in the Triple-A National Championship Game to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball . The Triple-A classification was created before the 1946 season . Prior to then , the top level of the minors had been designated as Double-A since 1912 .

Several leagues , known as independent baseball leagues , do not have any official links to Major League Baseball . Except for the Mexican League , teams in the organized minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one major league team through a standardized Player Development Contract ( PDC ) . These leagues also go by the nicknames the farm system , farm club , or farm team ( s ) because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system , and teams in small towns were growing players down on the farm like corn . Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams may enter into a PDC for a two- or four-year term . At the expiration of a PDC term , teams may renew their affiliation , or sign new PDCs with different clubs , though many relationships are renewed and endure for extended time periods . For example , the Omaha Storm Chasers ( formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes ) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969 , but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations , after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979 , to the Washington Nationals in 2007 , and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Indians since 2009 .
