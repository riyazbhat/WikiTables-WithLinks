  "/wiki/Regular_polygon": "In Euclidean geometry , a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular ( all angles are equal in measure ) and equilateral ( all sides have the same length ) . Regular polygons may be either convex or star . In the limit , a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides approximates a circle , if the perimeter or area is fixed , or a regular apeirogon ( effectively a straight line ) , if the edge length is fixed .",
  "/wiki/Face-transitive": "In geometry , a polytope of dimension 3 ( a polyhedron ) or higher is isohedral or face-transitive when all its faces are the same . More specifically , all faces must be not merely congruent but must be transitive , i.e . must lie within the same symmetry orbit . In other words , for any faces A and B , there must be a symmetry of the entire solid by rotations and reflections that maps A onto B . For this reason , convex isohedral polyhedra are the shapes that will make fair dice . Isohedral polyhedra are called isohedra . They can be described by their face configuration . A form that is isohedral and has regular vertices is also edge-transitive ( isotoxal ) and is said to be a quasiregular dual : some theorists regard these figures as truly quasiregular because they share the same symmetries , but this is not generally accepted . An isohedron has an even number of faces . A polyhedron which is isohedral has a dual polyhedron that is vertex-transitive ( isogonal ) . The Catalan solids , the bipyramids and the trapezohedra are all isohedral . They are the duals of the isogonal Archimedean solids , prisms and antiprisms , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Edge-transitive": "In geometry , a polytope ( for example , a polygon or a polyhedron ) , or a tiling , is isotoxal or edge-transitive if its symmetries act transitively on its edges . Informally , this means that there is only one type of edge to the object : given two edges , there is a translation , rotation and/or reflection that will move one edge to the other , while leaving the region occupied by the object unchanged . The term isotoxal is derived from the Greek \u03c4\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03bd meaning arc .",
  "/wiki/Vertex-transitive": "In geometry , a polytope ( a polygon , polyhedron or tiling , for example ) is isogonal or vertex-transitive if all its vertices are equivalent under the symmetries of the figure . This implies that each vertex is surrounded by the same kinds of face in the same or reverse order , and with the same angles between corresponding faces . Technically , we say that for any two vertices there exists a symmetry of the polytope mapping the first isometrically onto the second . Other ways of saying this are that the group of automorphisms of the polytope is transitive on its vertices , or that the vertices lie within a single symmetry orbit . All vertices of a finite n-dimensional isogonal figure exist on an ( n-1 ) -sphere . The term isogonal has long been used for polyhedra . Vertex-transitive is a synonym borrowed from modern ideas such as symmetry groups and graph theory . The pseudorhombicuboctahedronwhich is not isogonaldemonstrates that simply asserting that all vertices look the same is not as restrictive as the definition used here , which involves the group of isometries preserving the polyhedron or tiling .",
  "/wiki/Parallelohedron": "In geometry a parallelohedron is a polyhedron that can tessellate 3-dimensional spaces with face-to-face contacts via translations . This requires all opposite faces be congruent . Parallelohedra can only have parallelogonal faces , either parallelograms or hexagons with parallel opposite edges . There are 5 types , first identified by Evgraf Fedorov in his studies of crystallographic systems .",

The vertex figure of a simple d-polytope is a ( d \u2212 1 ) -simplex . Simple polytopes are topologically dual to simplicial polytopes . The family of polytopes which are both simple and simplicial are simplices or two-dimensional polygons . A simple polyhedron is a three-dimensional polyhedron whose vertices are adjacent to three edges and three faces . The dual to a simple polyhedron is a simplicial polyhedron , in which all faces are triangles .",

  "/wiki/Hexagonal_prism": "In geometry , the hexagonal prism is a prism with hexagonal base . This polyhedron has 8 faces , 18 edges , and 12 vertices . Since it has 8 faces , it is an octahedron . However , the term octahedron is primarily used to refer to the regular octahedron , which has eight triangular faces . Because of the ambiguity of the term octahedron and the dissimilarity of the various eight-sided figures , the term is rarely used without clarification . Before sharpening , many pencils take the shape of a long hexagonal prism .",

  "/wiki/Parallelopiped": "In geometry , a parallelepiped , parallelopiped or parallelopipedon is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms ( the term rhomboid is also sometimes used with this meaning ) . By analogy , it relates to a parallelogram just as a cube relates to a square or as a cuboid to a rectangle . In Euclidean geometry , its definition encompasses all four concepts ( i.e. , parallelepiped , parallelogram , cube , and square ) . In this context of affine geometry , in which angles are not differentiated , its definition admits only parallelograms and parallelepipeds . Three equivalent definitions of parallelepiped are The rectangular cuboid ( six rectangular faces ) , cube ( six square faces ) , and the rhombohedron ( six rhombus faces ) are all specific cases of parallelepiped .

  "/wiki/Rhombic_triacontahedron": "In geometry , the rhombic triacontahedron , sometimes simply called the triacontahedron as it is the most common thirty-faced polyhedron , is a convex polyhedron with 30 rhombic faces .

The ratio of the long diagonal to the short diagonal of each face is exactly equal to the golden ratio , \u03c6 , so that the acute angles on each face measure , or approximately 63.43\u00b0 . A rhombus so obtained is called a golden rhombus . Being the dual of an Archimedean solid , the rhombic triacontahedron is face-transitive , meaning the symmetry group of the solid acts transitively on the set of faces . This means that for any two faces , A and B , there is a rotation or reflection of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving face A to face B . The rhombic triacontahedron is somewhat special in being one of the nine edge-transitive convex polyhedra , the others being the five Platonic solids , the cuboctahedron , the icosidodecahedron , and the rhombic dodecahedron . The rhombic triacontahedron is also interesting in that its vertices include the arrangement of four Platonic solids . It contains ten tetrahedra , five cubes , an icosahedron and a dodecahedron .
