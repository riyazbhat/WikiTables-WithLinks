Jane Eyre follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine , including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester , the brooding master of Thornfield Hall . The novel revolutionised prose fiction by being the first to focus on its protagonist 's moral and spiritual development through an intimate first-person narrative , where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity . Charlotte Bront\u00eb has been called the first historian of the private consciousness , and the literary ancestor of writers like Proust and Joyce . The book contains elements of social criticism , with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core , and is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane 's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class , sexuality , religion and feminism .",
