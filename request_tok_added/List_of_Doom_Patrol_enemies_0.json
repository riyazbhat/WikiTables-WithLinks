  "/wiki/Nazi": "National Socialism ( ) , more commonly known as Nazism ( ) , is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party - officially the National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( or NSDAP ) - in Nazi Germany , and of other far-right groups with similar ideas and aims . Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology 's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system , but also incorporated fervent antisemitism , anti-communism , scientific racism , and eugenics into its creed . Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist v\u00f6lkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time , and it was strongly influenced by the paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany 's defeat in World War I , from which came the party 's cult of violence which was at the heart of the movement . Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism , identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race . It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people 's community ( ) . The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory , as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or inferior races . The term National Socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism , as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism . Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality , opposed cosmopolitan internationalism , and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good , accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization , which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism . The Nazi Party 's precursor , the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers ' Party , was founded on 5 January 1919 . By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers ' Party - to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Communists ( KPD ) - and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organization . The National Socialist Program or 25 Points was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent , while also supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries . In ( My Struggle ; 1924-1925 ) , Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy , as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany 's right to territorial expansion .",
  "/wiki/U-boat": "U-boat is an anglicised version of the German word U-Boot [ \u02c8u\u02d0bo\u02d0t ] ( listen ) , a shortening of Unterseeboot , literally undersea boat . While the German term refers to any submarine , the English one ( in common with several other languages ) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany , particularly in the First and Second World Wars . Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships , they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ( commerce raiding ) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping . The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire , and from the United States to the United Kingdom and ( during the Second World War ) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean . German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II , causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 . Austro-Hungarian Navy submarines were also known as U-boats .",
