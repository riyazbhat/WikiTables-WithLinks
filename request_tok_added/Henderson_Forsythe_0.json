In real life , her death gave rise to a 1979 lawsuit , Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee , led by attorney Gerry Spence . The jury rendered its verdict of $ 10 million in damages to be paid to the Silkwood estate ( her children ) , the largest amount in damages ever awarded for that kind of case at the time . The Silkwood estate eventually settled for $ 1.3 million . Silkwood was shot largely in both New Mexico and Texas on a budget of $ 10 million .

Streep had just finished filming Sophie 's Choice ( 1982 ) when production began .
