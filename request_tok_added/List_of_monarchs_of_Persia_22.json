  "/wiki/Dervish": "Dervish or Darvesh or Darw\u012bsh ( from , Darv\u012bsh ) in Islam can refer broadly to members of a Sufi fraternity ( tariqah ) , or more narrowly to a religious mendicant , who chose or accepted material poverty . The latter usage is found particularly in Persian and Turkish , corresponding to the Arabic term faqir . Their focus is on the universal values of love and service , deserting the illusions of ego to reach God . In most Sufi orders , a dervish is known to practice dhikr through physical exertions or religious practices to attain the ecstatic trance to reach God . Their most common practice is Sama , which is associated with the 13th-century mystic Rumi . In folklore , dervishes are often credited with the ability to perform miracles and described with supernatural powers .",
  "/wiki/Tamerlane": "Timur ( Chagatai : Tem\u00fcr Iron ; 9 April 1336 - 17-19 February 1405 ) , later Tim\u016br Gurk\u0101n\u012b , sometimes spelled Taimur and historically best known as Amir Timur or Tamerlane ( , Timur the Lame ) , was a Turco-Mongol Persianate conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire in and around modern-day Iran and Central Asia , becoming the first ruler of the Timurid dynasty . As an undefeated commander , he is widely regarded to be one of the greatest military leaders and tacticians in history . Timur is also considered as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru . He is often credited with the invention of the Tamerlane chess variant , played on a larger 10\u00d711 board . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur was the product of an Islamized and Iranized society , and not steppe nomadic . Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana ( in modern-day Uzbekistan ) on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base , he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate of India . From these conquests , he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death . Timur was the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Islamic Gunpowder Empires in the 16th and 17th centuries . Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) and according to G\u00e9rard Chaliand , saw himself as Genghis Khan 's heir . Though not a Borjigid or a descendant of Genghis Khan , he clearly sought to invoke the legacy of the latter 's conquests during his lifetime . According to Beatrice Forbes Manz , in his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights ."
