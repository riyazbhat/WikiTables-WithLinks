  "/wiki/Kiss_Me_Kate_(film)": "Kiss Me Kate is a 1953 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name . Inspired by The Taming of the Shrew , it tells the tale of musical theater actors Fred Graham and Lilli Vanessi , who were once married , and are now performing opposite each other in the roles of Petruchio and Katherine in a Broadway-bound musical version of William Shakespeare 's play . Already on poor terms , the pair begin an all-out emotional war mid-performance that threatens the production 's success . The only thing keeping the show together are threats from a pair of gangsters , who have come to collect a gambling debt from the show 's Lucentio , Bill Calhoun . In classic musical comedy fashion , slapstick madness ensues before everything is resolved . Dorothy Kingsley 's screenplay , which was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award , was adapted from the musical 's book by Bella and Samuel Spewack . The songs were by Cole Porter , with musical underscoring by Saul Chaplin and Andr\u00e9 Previn , who were nominated for an Oscar . Hermes Pan choreographed the dance routines . The movie was filmed in 3-D , using the most advanced methods of that technique then available .

  "/wiki/Damn_Yankees_(film)": "Damn Yankees ! is a 1958 musical film made by Warner Bros. based on the 1955 Broadway musical of the same name . The story is a modern take on the Faust legend involving the New York Yankees and Washington Senators baseball teams . The film was directed by George Abbott , as was the earlier stage version , with assistance from Stanley Donen . With the exception of Tab Hunter in the role of Joe Hardy ( replacing Stephen Douglass ) , the Broadway principals reprised their stage roles , including Gwen Verdon as Lola . A notable difference between film and stage versions was Gwen Verdon 's performance of the song A Little Brains . For the film , Verdon 's suggestive hip movements ( as choreographed by Bob Fosse and performed on stage ) were considered too risqu\u00e9 for a mainstream American film in 1958 , and so , in the film , she simply pauses at these points . The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title What Lola Wants , to avoid use of the word Damn on posters , hoardings and cinema marquees .",

  "/wiki/Cabaret_(1972_film)": "Cabaret is a 1972 American musical drama film directed by Bob Fosse , and starring Liza Minnelli , Michael York , and Joel Grey . Set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931 , under the presence of the growing Nazi Party , the film is loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical Cabaret by Kander and Ebb , which was adapted from the novel The Berlin Stories / Goodbye to Berlin ( 1939 ) by Christopher Isherwood and the 1951 play I Am a Camera adapted from the same book . Only a few numbers from the stage score were used for the film ; Kander and Ebb wrote new ones to replace those that were discarded . In the traditional manner of musical theater , called an integrated musical , every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot . In the film version , the musical numbers are entirely diegetic . All of them take place inside the club , with one exception : Tomorrow Belongs to Me , the only song sung neither by Grey 's character of the Kit Kat Klub 's Master of Ceremonies nor by Minnelli 's character of Sally Bowles . After the box office failure of his film version of Sweet Charity in 1969 , Bob Fosse bounced back with Cabaret in 1972 , a year that made him the most honored director in the movie business . The film also brought Liza Minnelli , the daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli , her own first chance to sing on screen , and she won the Academy Award for Best Actress . With Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor ( Joel Grey ) , Best Director ( Bob Fosse ) , Best Cinematography , Best Art Direction , Best Sound , Best Original Song Score and Adaptation , and Best Film Editing , Cabaret holds the record for most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture . It is listed as number 367 on Empires 500 greatest films of all time . Cabaret opened to glowing reviews and strong box office , eventually taking in more than $ 20 million . In addition to its eight Oscars , it won Best Picture citations from the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , and took Best Supporting Actor honors for Grey from the National Board of Review , the Hollywood Foreign Press , and the National Society of Film Critics .",
