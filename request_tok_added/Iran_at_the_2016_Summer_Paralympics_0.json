  "/wiki/Sport": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",
  "/wiki/Men": "A man is an adult male human . Prior to adulthood , a male human is referred to as a boy . Like most other male mammals , a man 's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father . The male fetus generally produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus . This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women . During puberty , hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics , thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes . However , there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men .",
  "/wiki/Women": "A woman is a female human being . The word woman is usually reserved for an adult ; girl is the usual term for a female child or adolescent . The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans , regardless of age , as in phrases such as women 's rights . Typically , a woman has two X chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause . Female anatomy , as distinguished from male anatomy , includes the fallopian tubes , ovaries , uterus , vulva , breasts , Skene 's glands , and Bartholin 's glands . The female pelvis is wider than the male , the hips are generally broader , and women have significantly less facial and other body hair . On average , women are shorter and less muscular than men . Throughout human history , traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women 's activities and opportunities ; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women . With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies , women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker , and the ability to pursue higher education . Violence against women , whether within families or in communities , has a long history and is primarily committed by men . Some women are denied reproductive rights . The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality .",
