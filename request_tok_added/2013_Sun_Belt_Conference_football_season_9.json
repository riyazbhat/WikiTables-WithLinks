Following the war , Knoxville grew rapidly as a major wholesaling and manufacturing center . The city 's economy stagnated after the 1920s as the manufacturing sector collapsed , the downtown area declined and city leaders became entrenched in highly partisan political fights . Hosting the 1982 World 's Fair helped reinvigorate the city , and revitalization initiatives by city leaders and private developers have had major successes in spurring growth in the city , especially the downtown area . Knoxville is the home of the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee , whose sports teams , the Tennessee Volunteers , are popular in the surrounding area .
