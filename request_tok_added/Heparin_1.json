  "/wiki/Acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . As the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy .",
  "/wiki/Human_immunodeficiency_virus": "The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV ) are two species of Lentivirus ( a subgroup of retrovirus ) that infect humans . Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive . Without treatment , average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years , depending on the HIV subtype . In most cases , HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood , pre-ejaculate , semen , and vaginal fluids . Research has shown ( for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples ) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load . Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy , during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid , and through breast milk . Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells . HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system , such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4+ T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells . HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms , including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells , apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells . When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections , leading to the development of AIDS .",
  "/wiki/Adult_respiratory_distress_syndrome": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs . Symptoms include shortness of breath , rapid breathing , and bluish skin coloration . Among those who survive , a decreased quality of life is relatively common . Causes may include sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , pneumonia , and aspiration . The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs , surfactant dysfunction , activation of the immune system , and dysfunction of the body 's regulation of blood clotting . In effect , ARDS impairs the lungs ' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide . Diagnosis is based on a PaO/FiO ratio of less than 300 mmHg despite a PEEP of more than 5 cm HO . Heart related pulmonary edema , as the cause , must be excluded . The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause . Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures . If oxygenation remains insufficient lung recruitment maneuvers and paralysis may be tried . If this is insufficient ECMO may be an option .",
  "/wiki/Clinical_trial": "Clinical trials are experiments or observations done in clinical research . Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions , including new treatments ( such as novel vaccines , drugs , dietary choices , dietary supplements , and medical devices ) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison . Clinical trials generate data on safety and efficacy . They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought . These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is 'safe ' or effective , only that the trial may be conducted . Depending on product type and development stage , investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies . Clinical trials can vary in size and cost , and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers , in one country or in multiple countries . Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results . Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug . The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical , biotechnology or medical device company . Certain functions necessary to the trial , such as monitoring and lab work , may be managed by an outsourced partner , such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory . Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become approved drugs .",

  "/wiki/Animal_model": "An animal model ( short for animal disease model ) is a living , non-human , often genetic-engineered animal used during the research and investigation of human disease , for the purpose of better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human . Although biological activity in an animal model does not ensure an effect in humans , many drugs , treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models . Animal models representing specific taxonomic groups in the research and study of developmental processes are also referred to as model organisms . There are three main types of animal models : Homologous , Isomorphic and Predictive . Homologous animals have the same causes , symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease . Isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments , only . Predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects . However , these are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features .",
  "/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis": "Allergic rhinitis , also known as hay fever , is a type of inflammation in the nose which occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air . Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose , sneezing , red , itchy , and watery eyes , and swelling around the eyes . The fluid from the nose is usually clear . Symptom onset is often within minutes following allergen exposure and can affect sleep , and the ability to work or study . Some people may develop symptoms only during specific times of the year , often as a result of pollen exposure . Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma , allergic conjunctivitis , or atopic dermatitis . Allergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen , pet hair , dust , or mold . Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies . Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases this risk . The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies that attach to an allergen , and subsequently result in the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells . Diagnosis is typically based on a combination of symptoms and a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies . These tests , however , can be falsely positive .",
  "/wiki/Arthritis": "Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints . Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness . Other symptoms may include redness , warmth , swelling , and decreased range of motion of the affected joints . In some types of arthritis , other organs are also affected . Onset can be gradual or sudden . There are over 100 types of arthritis . The most common forms are osteoarthritis ( degenerative joint disease ) and rheumatoid arthritis . Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers , knees , and hips . Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet . Other types include gout , lupus , fibromyalgia , and septic arthritis . They are all types of rheumatic disease . Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat .",
  "/wiki/Collagen": "Collagen /\u02c8k\u0252l\u0259d\u0292\u026an/ is the main structural protein in the extracellular matrix in the various connective tissues in the body . As the main component of connective tissue , it is the most abundant protein in mammals , making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content . Collagen consists of amino acids bound together to form a triple helix of elongated fibril known as a collagen helix . It is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons , ligaments , and skin . Depending upon the degree of mineralization , collagen tissues may be rigid ( bone ) , compliant ( tendon ) , or have a gradient from rigid to compliant ( cartilage ) . It is also abundant in corneas , blood vessels , the gut , intervertebral discs , and the dentin in teeth . In muscle tissue , it serves as a major component of the endomysium . Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong , tendinous , muscles . The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen . Gelatin , which is used in food and industry , is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed . Collagen has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin . The name collagen comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 ( k\u00f3lla ) , meaning glue , and suffix -\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd , -gen , denoting producing .",
  "/wiki/Angiogenesis": "Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels , formed in the earlier stage of vasculogenesis . Angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature by processes of sprouting and splitting . Vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors , and from neovascularization , although discussions are not always precise ( especially in older texts ) . The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis , after which angiogenesis is responsible for most , if not all , blood vessel growth during development and in disease . Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development , as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue . However , it is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one , leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer . The essential role of angiogenesis in tumor growth was first proposed in 1971 by Judah Folkman , who described tumors as hot and bloody , illustrating that , at least for many tumor types , flush perfusion and even hyperemia are characteristic .",
  "/wiki/Anecdotal_report": "Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes : evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony . The term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony which are uncorroborated by objective , independent evidence such as notarized documentation , photographs , audio-visual recordings , etc . When used in advertising or promotion of a product , service , or idea , anecdotal reports are often called a testimonial , which are highly regulated or banned in some jurisdictions . When compared to other types of evidence , anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses , but may be considered within the scope of scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable , e.g . in the use of case studies in medicine . Other anecdotal evidence , however , does not qualify as scientific evidence , because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method . Where only one or a few anecdotes are presented , there is a larger chance that they may be unreliable due to cherry-picked or otherwise non-representative samples of typical cases . Similarly , psychologists have found that due to cognitive bias people are more likely to remember notable or unusual examples rather than typical examples . Thus , even when accurate , anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a typical experience . Accurate determination of whether an anecdote is typical requires statistical evidence . Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an informal fallacy and is sometimes referred to as the person who fallacy ( I know a person who . ; I know of a case where .",
  "/wiki/Asthma": "Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs . It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms , reversible airflow obstruction , and easily triggered bronchospasms . Symptoms include episodes of wheezing , coughing , chest tightness , and shortness of breath . These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week . Depending on the person , asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise . Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens . Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers . Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms , response to therapy over time , and spirometry lung function testing . Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , and peak expiratory flow rate . It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic , where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction . There is no cure for asthma .",
  "/wiki/Cancer": "Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body . These contrast with benign tumors , which do not spread . Possible signs and symptoms include a lump , abnormal bleeding , prolonged cough , unexplained weight loss , and a change in bowel movements . While these symptoms may indicate cancer , they can also have other causes . Over 100 types of cancers affect humans . Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths . Another 10% are due to obesity , poor diet , lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol . Other factors include certain infections , exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants . In the developing world , 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human papillomavirus infection , Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . These factors act , at least partly , by changing the genes of a cell . Typically , many genetic changes are required before cancer develops . Approximately 5-10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person 's parents .",
  "/wiki/Tumour": "A neoplasm ( /\u02c8ni\u02d0o\u028apl\u00e6z\u0259m , \u02c8ni\u0259-/ ) is a type of abnormal and excessive growth , called neoplasia , of tissue . The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue , and it persists growing abnormally , even if the original trigger is removed . This abnormal growth usually ( but not always ) forms a mass . When it forms a mass , it may be called a tumor . ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups : benign neoplasms , in situ neoplasms , malignant neoplasms , and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior . Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology . Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue , as neoplasia , cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth , such as metaplasia or dysplasia . However , metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia . The word is from Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2- neo ( new ) and \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 plasma ( formation , creation ) .",
  "/wiki/Metastasis": "Metastasis is a pathogenic agent 's spread from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host 's body ; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor . The newly pathological sites , then , are metastases ( mets ) . It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion , which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues . Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely . This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour . The cells which constitute the tumor eventually undergo metaplasia , followed by dysplasia then anaplasia , resulting in a malignant phenotype . This malignancy allows for invasion into the circulation , followed by invasion to a second site for tumorigenesis . Some cancer cells known as circulating tumor cells acquire the ability to penetrate the walls of lymphatic or blood vessels , after which they are able to circulate through the bloodstream to other sites and tissues in the body . This process is known ( respectively ) as lymphatic or hematogenous spread . After the tumor cells come to rest at another site , they re-penetrate the vessel or walls and continue to multiply , eventually forming another clinically detectable tumor . This new tumor is known as a metastatic ( or secondary ) tumor . Metastasis is one of the hallmarks of cancer , distinguishing it from benign tumors .",
  "/wiki/Hypersensitivity": "Hypersensitivity ( also called hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance ) refers to undesirable reactions produced by the normal immune system , including allergies and autoimmunity . They are usually referred to as an over-reaction of the immune system and these reactions may be damaging , uncomfortable , or occasionally fatal . Hypersensitivity reactions require a pre-sensitized ( immune ) state of the host . They are classified in four groups after the proposal of P. G. H. Gell and Robin Coombs in 1963 .",

Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away , needing to urinate often , and pain with sex . IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life . Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia . The cause of IC/BPS is unknown . While it can , it does not typically run in a family . The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions . Typically the urine culture is negative . Ulceration or inflammation may be seen on cystoscopy . Other conditions which can produce similar symptoms include urinary tract infection ( UTI ) , overactive bladder , sexually transmitted infections , endometriosis , bladder cancer , and prostatitis . There is no cure for interstitial cystitis . Treatments that may improve symptoms include lifestyle changes , medications , or procedures .",
  "/wiki/Transplant_rejection": "Transplant rejection occurs when transplanted tissue is rejected by the recipient 's immune system , which destroys the transplanted tissue . Transplant rejection can be lessened by determining the molecular similitude between donor and recipient and by use of immunosuppressant drugs after transplant .",
  "/wiki/Allograft": "Allotransplant ( allo- meaning other in Greek ) is the transplantation of cells , tissues , or organs to a recipient from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species . The transplant is called an allograft , allogeneic transplant , or homograft . Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts . It is contrasted with autotransplantation ( from one part of the body to another in the same person ) , syngeneic transplantation ( grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species ) and xenotransplantation ( from other species ) . Allografts can be referred to as homostatic if they are biologically inert when transplanted , such as bone and cartilage . An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is termed rejection . An allogenic bone marrow transplant can result in an immune attack , called graft-versus-host disease ."
