The Arab League was formed in Cairo on 22 March 1945 initially with six members : Egypt , Iraq , Transjordan ( renamed Jordan in 1949 ) , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , and Syria . Yemen joined as a member on 5 May 1945 . Currently , the League has 22 members , but Syria 's participation has been suspended since November 2011 . The League 's main goal is to draw closer the relations between member states and co-ordinate collaboration between them , to safeguard their independence and sovereignty , and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries . Through institutions , such as the Arab League Educational , Cultural and Scientific Organization ( ALECSO ) and the Economic and Social Council of the Arab League 's Council of Arab Economic Unity ( CAEU ) , the Arab League facilitates political , economic , cultural , scientific , and social programmes designed to promote the interests of the Arab world . It has served as a forum for the member states to coordinate their policy positions , to deliberate on matters of common concern , to settle some Arab disputes and to limit conflicts such as the 1958 Lebanon crisis . The League has served as a platform for the drafting and conclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration . One example is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter , which outlines the principles for economic activities in the region .",

Tehran is the political and economic center of Iran , and the largest and most populous city in Western Asia with more than 8.8 million residents in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area . Iran is home to one of the world 's oldest civilizations , beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BCE . It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BCE , and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BCE under Cyrus the Great , whose Achaemenid Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley , one of the largest empires in history . The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE and was divided into several Hellenistic states . An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE , which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire , a leading world power for the next four centuries . Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE , and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion . Iran 's major contributions to art , philosophy , and science spread throughout the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age .",

Its metropolitan area , with a population of over 20 million , is the largest in Africa , the Arab world , and the Middle East , and the 15th-largest in the world . Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt , as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area . Located near the Nile Delta , Cairo was founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid dynasty , but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo . Cairo has long been a centre of the region 's political and cultural life , and is titled the city of a thousand minarets for its preponderance of Islamic architecture . Cairo is considered a World City with a Beta + classification according to GaWC . Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab world , as well as the world 's second-oldest institution of higher learning , Al-Azhar University . Many international media , businesses , and organizations have regional headquarters in the city ; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence . With a population of over 9 million spread over 3,085 square kilometers ( 1,191 sq mi ) , Cairo is by far the largest city in Egypt . An additional 9.5 million inhabitants live in close proximity to the city . Cairo , like many other megacities , suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic .

With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran , Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia , and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East ( after Cairo ) . It is ranked 24th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area . In the Classical era , part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages , a prominent Median city . It was subject to destruction through the medieval Arab , Turkic , and Mongol invasions . Its modern-day inheritor remains as an urban area absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran . Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786 , in order to remain within close reach of Iran 's territories in the Caucasus , before being separated from Iran as a result of the Russo-Iranian Wars , and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties . The capital has been moved several times throughout history , and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran . Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s , and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century . Tehran is home to many historical collections , including the royal complexes of Golestan , Sa'dabad , and Niavaran , where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated . Tehran 's most famous landmarks include the Azadi Tower , a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran , and the Milad Tower , the world 's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower which was completed in 2007 . The Tabiat Bridge , a newly built landmark , was completed in 2014 .",

However , their membership is characterized by boundaries and demarcations characteristic to a defined and unique geography , such as continents , or geopolitics , such as economic blocs . They have been established to foster cooperation and political and economic integration or dialogue among states or entities within a restrictive geographical or geopolitical boundary . They both reflect common patterns of development and history that have been fostered since the end of World War II as well as the fragmentation inherent in globalization , which is why their institutional characteristics vary from loose cooperation to formal regional integration . Most ROs tend to work alongside well-established multilateral organizations such as the United Nations . While in many instances a regional organization is simply referred to as an international organization , in many others it makes sense to use the term regional organization to stress the more limited scope of a particular membership . Examples of ROs include , a.o. , the African Union ( AU ) , Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , Arab League ( AL ) , Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) , Council of Europe ( CoE ) , Eurasian Economic Union ( EEU ) , European Union ( EU ) , South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization ( AALCO ) , Union for the Mediterranean ( UfM ) , Union of South American Nations ( USAN ) .",

As a name or title , this include the Islamic states of Afghanistan , Iran , Mauritania and Pakistan . Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956 ; Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958 ; Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty ; and Afghanistan adopted it in 2004 after the fall of the Taliban government . Despite having similar names , the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws . As a term , it has come to mean several different things , some contradictory to others . To some Muslim religious leaders in the Middle East and Africa who advocate it , an Islamic republic is a state under a particular Islamic form of government . They see it as a compromise between a purely Islamic caliphate and a secular , nationalist republic . In their conception of the Islamic republic , the penal code of the state is required to be compatible with some or all laws of Sharia and the state may not be a monarchy as many Middle Eastern states are presently . Iran officially uses it as a title in all governance names referring to the country ( e.g . the Islamic Republic of Iran Army or the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ) as opposed to its equivalents in Afghanistan which are called the Afghan National Army and the Radio Television Afghanistan .

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic . This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists ; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic , but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 , the purest Arabic ) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) . Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",
  "/wiki/Sunni_Islam": "Sunni Islam ( /\u02c8su\u02d0ni , \u02c8s\u028ani/ ) is the largest denomination of Islam , followed by 87-90% of the world 's Muslims . Its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions . According to Sunni traditions , Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph . This contrasts with the Shia view , which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor , most notably at Ghadir Khumm . Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism . The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah ( the people of the sunnah and the community ) or ahl as-sunnah for short . In English , its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism , while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims , Sunnis , Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah . Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as orthodox Islam , though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate . The Quran , together with hadith ( especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah ) and binding juristic consensus , form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam . Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources , in conjunction with analogical reasoning , consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion , using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools . In matters of creed , the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of iman ( faith ) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of rationalistic theology as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology .",

It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the Imam ( leader ) after him , most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of Saqifah . This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunni Islam , whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the Prophet . Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs , Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad , Banu Hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become Muslim . Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam : as of the late 2000s , Shia Muslims constituted 10-15% of all Muslims . Twelver Shia is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85% of Shias were Twelvers . Shia Islam is based on the prophet 's hadith ( Ghadir Khumm ) . Shia consider Ali to have been divinely appointed as the successor to Muhammad , and as the first Imam . The Shia also extend this Imammah to Muhammad 's family , the Ahl al-Bayt ( the people/family of the House ) , and some individuals among his descendants , known as Imams , who they believe possess special spiritual and political authority over the community , infallibility and other divinely ordained traits . Although there are many Shia subsects , modern Shia Islam has been divided into two main groupings : Twelvers and Ismailis , with Twelver Shia being the largest and most influential group among Shia .",
  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",

The remaining 0.6% associate themselves with non-Islamic religious minorities , including Bah\u00e1'\u00eds , Mandeans , Yarsanis , Zoroastrians , Jews , and Christians . The latter three minority religions are officially recognized and protected , and have reserved seats in the Iran parliament . Zoroastrianism was once the majority religion , though today Zoroastrians number only in the tens of thousands . Iran is home to the second largest Jewish community in the Muslim world and the Middle East . The two largest non-Muslim religious minorities in Iran are the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith and Christianity . The Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , historically the largest religious minority in Iran , is not officially recognized , and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran .

This leaves the true representation of the religious split in Iran unknown as all non-religious , spiritual , atheist , agnostic and converts away from Islam are likely to be included within the government statistic of the 99% Muslim majority . Sunnism was the predominant form of Islam before the devastating Mongol conquest , but subsequently Shi'ism became eventually utterly dominant in all of Iran and modern-day Azerbaijan ( though highly secular ) with the advent of the Safavids .

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863 , it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East , where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception . It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents , known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds , spread throughout most of the world 's countries and territories . It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion , whose founder ( the B\u00e1b ) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad . In 1863 , after being banished from his native Iran , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h ( 1817-1892 ) announced that he was this prophet . He was further exiled , spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine . Following Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h 's death in 1892 , leadership of the religion fell to his son \u02bbAbdu ' l-Bah\u00e1 ( 1844-1921 ) , and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi ( 1897-1957 ) . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local , regional , and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion , and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice , the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community , which sits in Haifa , Israel , near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths : God is considered single and all-powerful . However , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history ; Buddha , Jesus , and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose , though varied in social practices and interpretations . There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people , openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism .",

The total number of Yarsanis is estimated at around 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 . They are primarily found in western Iran and eastern Iraq and are mostly ethnic Goran Kurds , though there are also smaller groups of Turk , Persian , Lori , Azerbaijani and Arab adherents . Some Yarsanis in Iraq are called Kaka ' i . Yarsanis say that some people call them disparagingly as Ali-o-allahi or worshipers of Ali which labels Yarsanis deny . Many Yarsanis hide their religion due to pressure of Iran 's Islamic system , and there are no exact statistics of their population . The Yarsanis have a distinct religious literature primarily written in the Gorani language . However , few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani ( a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani ) as their mother tongues are Southern Kurdish and Sorani , which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish languages . The speakers of Sarli living near Eski Kalak are adherents . Their central religious book is called the Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m , written in the 15th century based on the teachings of Sultan Sahak . The goal of Yarsanism is to teach humans to achieve ultimate truth .
