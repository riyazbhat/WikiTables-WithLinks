The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 ( sometimes referred to as the Football Cardinals or the Big Red to avoid confusion with the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball ) . Before the 1988 season , the team moved west to Tempe , Arizona , a college suburb east of Phoenix , and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University . In 2006 , the club moved to their current home field in Glendale , although the team 's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe . The franchise has won two NFL championships , both while it was based in Chicago . The first occurred in 1925 , but is the subject of controversy , with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the title . Their second title , and the first to be won in a championship game , came in 1947 , nearly two decades before the first Super Bowl .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",
