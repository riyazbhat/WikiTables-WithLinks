  "/wiki/Go_Tell_the_Spartans": "Go Tell the Spartans is a 1978 American war film directed by Ted Post , starring Burt Lancaster , and based on Daniel Ford 's 1967 novel Incident at Muc Wa , about U.S. Army military advisors during the early part of the Vietnam War in 1964 , a time when Ford was a correspondent in Vietnam for The Nation .

The choice of film 's name thus constitutes a deliberate spoiler by the film makers , telling anyone familiar with the source of the quote that the film 's soldier characters - like the Spartans at Thermopylae - had been sent to their deaths .",
