Heusden-Zolder is home to almost 2,000 immigrants from all over the world . This is due to the ( now closed ) coal mine of Zolder . During the 1960s Belgian coal mines faced an enormous shortage of employees . To address this problem , foreigner labourers were encouraged to immigrate and work near the mines . After their closure ( the mine in Zolder was the last one in Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxemburg to close in 1992 ) most of the immigrants chose to stay , which makes Heusden-Zolder a relatively multicultural place .",
