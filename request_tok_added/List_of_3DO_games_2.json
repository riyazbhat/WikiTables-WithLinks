Gavin and Rubin produced a sequence of progressively more successful games , including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior in the early 1990s .

Ultimately , this led to the release of Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation in 1996 . Naughty Dog developed three Crash Bandicoot games over the next several years . After developing Crash Team Racing , the company began working on Jak and Daxter : The Precursor Legacy for the PlayStation 2 .
