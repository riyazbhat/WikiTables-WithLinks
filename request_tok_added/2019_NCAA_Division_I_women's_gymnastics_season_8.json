  "/wiki/Hearnes_Center": "Hearnes Center is a 13,611-seat multi-purpose arena in Columbia , Missouri . The arena opened in 1972 . It is currently home to the Missouri Tigers ' wrestling and volleyball teams as well as the school 's gymnastics and indoor track & field teams . It was home to the University of Missouri Tigers basketball team before Mizzou Arena opened in 2004 . Groundbreaking for the Hearnes Center occurred in 1969 , and the arena was officially dedicated on August 4 , 1972 . The arena got its name from former Missouri governor and 1952 Mizzou graduate Warren Hearnes . The cost of the building project was $ 10.75 million . Prior to the opening of the Hearnes Center , the Missouri basketball team played its home games at Brewer Fieldhouse , which was built in 1929 and has since been remodeled into a modern recreation center . Hearnes quickly became one of the toughest places to play during the 1980s , when players such as Steve Stipanovich , Jon Sundvold , Derrick Chievous and Doug Smith suited up for Norm Stewart . Several factors contributed to this reputation : the steep banking of the seating area , its flat roof and angling of its upper sections , and The Antlers , whose presence in Section A-16 made them the bane of many an opposition . Decibel meters were added to the corners of the arena in the early 1990s in addition to new scoreboards , and it was not uncommon to see them go well above 110 dB during conference games , and regularly cresting 125 dB against Kansas or during 2001 's famed Fire Code Game against Iowa , where well over 14,500 people packed the building to see then- # 2 Mizzou be stunned by Steve Alford 's club . In its later life , the building saw several changes : a new floor was installed in 1998 , rear-projection video monitors replaced the matrix boards at the turn of the new millennium , and the student seating plan was also altered .",
