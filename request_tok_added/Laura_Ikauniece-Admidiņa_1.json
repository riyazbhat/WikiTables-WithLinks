  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",

  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",

Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil 's third-most populous state . Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site , named Rio de Janeiro : Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea , by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape . Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese , the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro , a domain of the Portuguese Empire . Later , in 1763 , it became the capital of the State of Brazil , a state of the Portuguese Empire . In 1808 , when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil , Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal , who subsequently , in 1815 , under the leadership of her son , the Prince Regent , and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal , raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom , within the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil , and Algarves . Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822 , when the War of Brazilian Independence began . This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies . Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy , the Empire of Brazil , until 1889 , and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia . Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country , and 30th largest in the world in 2008 , estimated at about R $ 343 billion ( nearly US $ 201 billion ) . It is headquarters to Brazilian oil , mining , and telecommunications companies , including two of the country 's major corporations - Petrobras and Vale - and Latin America 's largest telemedia conglomerate , Grupo Globo . The home of many universities and institutes , it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil , accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data .",
  "/wiki/100_metres_hurdles": "The 100 metres hurdles , or 100-meter hurdles , is a track and field event run mainly by women ( the male counterpart is the 110 metres hurdles ) . For the race , ten hurdles of a height of 83.8 centimetres ( 33.0 in ) are placed along a straight course of 100 metres ( 109.36 yd ) . The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line . The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other , and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long . The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner , but weighted so this is disadvantageous . Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in starting blocks . The fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds . The world record set by Kendra Harrison stands at 12.20 seconds .",
  "/wiki/High_jump": "The high jump is a track and field event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it . In its modern most practiced format , a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing . In the modern era , athletes run towards the bar and use the Fosbury Flop method of jumping , leaping head first with their back to the bar . Since ancient times , competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form . The discipline is , alongside the pole vault , one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the Olympic athletics programme . It is contested at the World Championships in Athletics and IAAF World Indoor Championships , and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings . The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women , having been held at the 1928 Olympic Games . Javier Sotomayor ( Cuba ) is the current men 's record holder with a jump of 2.45 m ( 8 ft 1\u20444 in ) set in 1993 - the longest standing record in the history of the men 's high jump . Stefka Kostadinova ( Bulgaria ) has held the women 's world record at 2.09 m ( 6 ft 10 1\u20444 in ) since 1987 , also the longest-held record in the event .",
