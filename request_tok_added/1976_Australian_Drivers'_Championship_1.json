  "/wiki/Leyland_P76": "The Leyland P76 is a large car that was produced by Leyland Australia , the Australian subsidiary of British Leyland . Featuring what was described at the time as the standard Australian wheelbase of 111 inches , it was intended to provide the company with a genuine rival to large local models like the Ford Falcon , the Holden Kingswood , and the Chrysler Valiant . But , due to the first real fuel crisis and demand far exceeding the supply , Leyland rushed the assembly process with the first of the P76s to come off the assembly line , resulting in poor build quality and some reliability problems . The combination of the rushed assembly , fuel crisis and strikes at the component manufacturers ' factories , resulted in the Leyland P76 being labelled a lemon , despite receiving the Wheels magazine Car of the Year in 1973 . By 1974 , sales of the P76 had slumped and BMC decided to end the production of the P76 . Although the P76 has been labelled a lemon in Australian motoring history , it has become an iconic Aussie car and has a loyal following . In 1969 , Leyland Australia was given the go-ahead to build a large car for Australia . At the time of the car 's launch , it was reported that Leyland Australia had an accumulated deficit equivalent to \u00a38.6 million , and had borrowed the same amount again in order to fund the development of the P76 . The P76 was designed and built from scratch with a fund of only A $ 20m . This was also a decade of serious financial and operational challenges for the parent company back in Britain . Commercial success for this car was therefore seen as crucial to the survival of Leyland in Australia . Launched in 1973 , the P76 was nicknamed the wedge , on account of its shape , with a large boot , able to easily hold a 44 gallon drum .",
