  "/wiki/Smallpox": "Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants , Variola major and Variola minor . The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977 , and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980 . The risk of death following contracting the disease was about 30% , with higher rates among babies . Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin , and some were left blind . The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting . This was followed by formation of sores in the mouth and a skin rash . Over a number of days the skin rash turned into characteristic fluid-filled bumps with a dent in the center . The bumps then scabbed over and fell off , leaving scars . The disease was spread between people or via contaminated objects . Prevention was by the smallpox vaccine . Once the disease had developed , certain antiviral medication may have helped . The origin of smallpox is unknown .",
  "/wiki/Measles": "Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus . Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7-10 days . Initial symptoms typically include fever , often greater than 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) , cough , runny nose , and inflamed eyes . Small white spots known as Koplik 's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms . A red , flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms . Common complications include diarrhea ( in 8% of cases ) , middle ear infection ( 7% ) , and pneumonia ( 6% ) . These occur in part due to measles-induced immunosuppression . Less commonly seizures , blindness , or inflammation of the brain may occur . Other names include morbilli , rubeola , red measles , and English measles . Both rubella , also known as German measles , and roseola are different diseases caused by unrelated viruses . Measles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people . It may also be spread through direct contact with mouth or nasal secretions .",
  "/wiki/Black_Death": "The Black Death , also known as the Pestilence ( Pest for short ) , the Great Plague or the Plague , or less commonly the Black Plague , was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated people in Eurasia , peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351 . The bacterium Yersinia pestis , which results in several forms of plague ( septicemic , pneumonic and , the most common , bubonic ) is believed to have been the cause . The Black Death was the first major European outbreak of plague , and the second plague pandemic . The plague created a number of religious , social and economic upheavals , with profound effects on the course of European history . The Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia , where it travelled along the Silk Road , reaching Crimea by 1343 . From there , it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that traveled on all merchant ships , spreading throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Europe . The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe 's population . In total , the plague may have reduced the world population from an estimated 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century . It took 200 years for the world population to recover to its previous level . The plague recurred as outbreaks in Europe until the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Malaria": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group . The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood . The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_flu": "The 1918 influenza pandemic ( January 1918 - December 1920 ; colloquially known as Spanish flu ) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic , the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus . It infected 500 million people around the world , including people on remote Pacific islands and in the Arctic . Probably 50 million , and possibly as high as 100 million ( three to five percent of Earth 's population at the time ) died , making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history . Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify with certainty the pandemic 's geographic origin . Infectious diseases already limited life expectancy in the early 20th century , but life expectancy in the United States dropped by about 12 years in the first year of the pandemic . Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the very young and the very old , with a higher survival rate for those in-between . However , the Spanish flu pandemic resulted in a higher than expected mortality rate for young adults . To maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany , the United Kingdom , France , and the United States . Papers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in neutral Spain ( such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII ) . These stories created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit , thereby giving rise to the pandemic 's nickname , Spanish flu . Scientists offer several possible explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic . Some analyses have shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a cytokine storm , which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults .",
  "/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian": "The Plague of Justinian ( 541-542 AD ) was a pandemic that afflicted the Byzantine ( Eastern Roman ) Empire and especially its capital , Constantinople , as well as the Sasanian Empire , and port cities around the entire Mediterranean Sea , as merchant ships harbored rats that carried fleas infected with plague . Some historians believe the plague of Justinian was one of the deadliest pandemics in history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 25-50 million people during two centuries of recurrence , a death toll equivalent to 13-26% of the world 's population at the time of the first outbreak . Recent research , however , has raised questions as to the plague 's actual demographic effects . The plague 's social and cultural impact has been compared to that of the similar Black Death that devastated Europe in the Middle Ages , 600 years after the last outbreak of Justinian 's plague . In 2013 , researchers confirmed earlier speculation that the cause of the Plague of Justinian was Yersinia pestis , the same bacterium responsible for Black Plague ( 1347-1351 ) . The latter was much shorter , but still killed an estimated one-third to one-half of Europeans . Ancient and modern Yersinia pestis strains closely related to the ancestor of the Justinian plague strain have been found in Tian Shan , a system of mountain ranges on the borders of Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , and China , suggesting that the Justinian plague may have originated in or near that region . Procopius , a Greek who was the principal historian of the 6th century , described the pandemic as worldwide in scope , and this first plague returned periodically until the eighth century . The waves of disease had a major effect on the subsequent course of European history . Modern historians named this plague incident after Justinian I , who was emperor at the time of the initial outbreak . Justinian himself contracted the disease , but survived .",
  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis . About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those affected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .",
  "/wiki/AIDS_pandemic": "HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic . As of 2018 , approximately 37.9 million people are infected with HIV globally . In 2018 , approximately 43% are women . There were about 770,000 deaths from AIDS in 2018 . The 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study , in a report published in The Lancet , estimated that the global incidence of HIV infection peaked in 1997 at 3.3 million per year . Global incidence fell rapidly from 1997 to 2005 , to about 2.6 million per year , but remained stable from 2005 to 2015 . Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected . In 2018 , an estimated 61% of new HIV infections occurred in this region . Prevalence ratios are In western and central Europe and North America , low and declining incidence of HIV and mortality among people infected with HIV over the last 17 years has seen the incidence : prevalence ratio fall from 0.06 in 2000 to 0.03 in 2017 . Strong and steady reductions in new HIV infections and mortality among people infected with HIV in eastern and southern Africa has pushed the ratio down from 0.11 in 2000 to 0.04 in 2017 . Progress has been more gradual in Asia and the Pacific ( 0.05 in 2017 ) , Latin America ( 0.06 in 2017 ) , the Caribbean ( 0.05 in 2017 ) and western and central Africa ( 0.06 in 2017 ) . The incidence : prevalence ratios of the Middle East and North Africa ( 0.08 in 2017 ) and eastern Europe and central Asia ( 0.09 in 2017 ) .",
  "/wiki/Third_plague_pandemic": "Third Pandemic is the designation of a major bubonic plague pandemic that began in Yunnan province in China in 1855 , fifth year of the Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing dynasty . This episode of bubonic plague spread to all inhabited continents , and ultimately more than 12 million people died in India and China , with about 10 million killed in India alone . According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was considered active until 1960 , when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year . The name refers to this pandemic being the third major bubonic plague outbreak to affect European society . The first was the Plague of Justinian , which ravaged the Byzantine Empire and surrounding areas in 541 and 542 . The second was the Black Death , which killed at least one third of Europe 's population in a series of expanding waves of infection from 1346 to 1353 . Casualty patterns indicate that waves of this late-19th-century/early-20th-century pandemic may have been from two different sources . The first was primarily bubonic and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade , through transporting infected persons , rats , and cargoes harboring fleas . The second , more virulent strain , was primarily pneumonic in character with a strong person-to-person contagion . This strain was largely confined to Asia , in particular Manchuria and Mongolia .",
  "/wiki/Bubonic_Plague": "Bubonic plague is one of three types of plague caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis . One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria , flu-like symptoms develop . These symptoms include fever , headaches , and vomiting . Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin . Occasionally , the swollen lymph nodes may break open . The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection : bubonic plague , septicemic plague , and pneumonic plague . Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals . It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague-infected animal . In the bubonic form of plague , the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node , causing it to swell . Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood , sputum , or fluid from lymph nodes . Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common . Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention .",
  "/wiki/Antonine_Plague": "The Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD , also known as the Plague of Galen ( from the name of the Greek physician living in the Roman Empire who described it ) , was an ancient pandemic brought back to the Roman Empire by troops returning from campaigns in the Near East . Scholars have suspected it to have been either smallpox or measles , but the true cause remains undetermined . The epidemic may have claimed the life of a Roman emperor , Lucius Verus , who died in 169 and was the co-regent of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , whose family name , Antoninus , has become associated with the epidemic . The disease broke out again nine years later , according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius ( 155-235 ) , causing up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome , one quarter of those who were affected , giving the disease a mortality rate of about 25% . The total deaths have been estimated at five million , and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army . Ancient sources agree that the epidemic appeared first during the Roman siege of Seleucia in the winter of 165-166 . Ammianus Marcellinus reports that the plague spread to Gaul and to the legions along the Rhine . Eutropius asserts that a large population died throughout the Empire . Rafe de Crespigny speculates that the plague may have also broken out in Eastern Han China before 166 , given notices of plagues in Chinese records . The plague affected Roman culture and literature , and may have severely affected Indo-Roman trade relations in the Indian Ocean .",
  "/wiki/Roman_Empire": "The Roman Empire ( Latin : Imperium R\u014dm\u0101num , Classical Latin : [ \u026am\u02c8p\u025br\u026a.\u0169\u02d0 ro\u02d0\u02c8ma\u02d0n\u0169\u02d0 ] ; Koin\u0113 Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , romanized : Basile\u00eda t\u014dn Rh\u014dma\u00ed\u014dn ) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome . As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) ."
