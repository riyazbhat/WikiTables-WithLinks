  "/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda": "Mass Effect : Andromeda is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts . The fourth major entry in the Mass Effect series , it was originally released in March 2017 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One . The game is set in the Andromeda Galaxy during the 29th century , where humanity is planning to populate new home worlds as part of a strategy called the Andromeda Initiative . The player assumes the role of either Scott or Sara Ryder , an inexperienced military recruit who joins the Initiative and wakes up in Andromeda following a 634-year journey . Events transpire that result in Ryder becoming humanity 's Pathfinder , tasked with finding a new home world for humanity while also dealing with an antagonistic alien race known as the Kett , and uncovering the secrets of a mysterious synthetic race known as the Remnant . For Mass Effect : Andromeda , BioWare incorporated a lighter tone than previous installments in the series , utilized open world elements , and placed an emphasis on exploration . Many of the series ' traditional gameplay elements remained , while others were modified , such as combat , which is less cover-based and more mobile . The game is the largest in the series , and offers the player the freedom to focus on either the main quest or side quests . Its score was composed by John Paesano and aims to match the game 's mood by capturing the adventure of space exploration . In contrast to the original Mass Effect trilogy , which was spearheaded by BioWare 's Edmonton studio , Mass Effect : Andromeda was handled by a new team out of Montreal . The game experienced a troubled production cycle that saw many members of its leadership team depart mid-project and numerous changes in creative vision . It was built using the Frostbite 3 engine , which required that BioWare construct all systems , tools , and assets from scratch as the series was previously built in Unreal Engine 3 .",
  "/wiki/Motion-capture_acting": "Motion-capture acting , also called performance-capture acting , sometimes abbreviated as MoCap or Pcap , is a type of acting in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit or directly on the skin . Several cameras from different angles record the actor 's movements simultaneously , recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor . Sampling is done many times each second , aided by advances in computer technology . The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting , such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air . This type of acting is seen as a growth area , with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors . Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors . Motion-capture acting can be difficult work . For example , one actor was placed in a tiny booth , had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements , and had to sit perfectly still . One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay , sword fighting , dance , general body movement , running and jumping , gymnastics , and hand-to-hand fighting . It is a new type of acting work . Numerous sources identify actor Andy Serkis as the king of motion-capture acting based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as The Lord of the Rings , King Kong and Planet of the Apes . According to one report , the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game Heavenly Sword which starred Serkis and others .",

  "/wiki/Motion_capture": "Motion capture ( sometimes referred as mo-cap or mocap , for short ) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people . It is used in military , entertainment , sports , medical applications , and for validation of computer vision and robotics . In filmmaking and video game development , it refers to recording actions of human actors , and using that information to animate digital character models in 2D or 3D computer animation . When it includes face and fingers or captures subtle expressions , it is often referred to as performance capture . In many fields , motion capture is sometimes called motion tracking , but in filmmaking and games , motion tracking usually refers more to match moving . In motion capture sessions , movements of one or more actors are sampled many times per second . Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D positions , often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor , not his or her visual appearance . This animation data is mapped to a 3D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor . This process may be contrasted with the older technique of rotoscoping , as seen in Ralph Bakshi 's The Lord of the Rings ( 1978 ) and American Pop ( 1981 ) . The animated character movements were achieved in these films by tracing over a live-action actor , capturing the actor 's motions and movements . To explain , an actor is filmed performing an action , and then the recorded film is projected onto an animation table frame-by-frame . Animators trace the live-action footage onto animation cels , capturing the actor 's outline and motions frame-by-frame , and then they fill in the traced outlines with the animated character .",
