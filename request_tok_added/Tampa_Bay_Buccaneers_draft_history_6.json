  "/wiki/Sean_Farrell": "Sean Ward Farrell ( born May 25 , 1960 ) is a former American football guard who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , New England Patriots , Denver Broncos , and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL . Farrell attended Westhampton Beach High School in Westhampton Beach , New York , where he was a football and track star . He then played college football for Penn State University , where he was named to a number of All-American teams in 1980 and 1981 . Farrell was the first round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft ; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese , and Farrell 's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room . The team then traded the next year 's first round pick in order to get Reese as well . Ironically , Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers , while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history . Tampa Bay 's team performance declined during Farrell 's years with the team . After his first contract expired in 1985 , he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team 's assurances that things would improve , but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans , I know what I want this Christmas . . . I want to get the hell out of Tampa Bay . New England acquired him in return for three draft picks , and he was the Patriots ' starting guard for three seasons before shoulder surgery kept him on the injured reserve list for most of the 1990 season .",
  "/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)": "In gridiron football , a guard ( G ) is a player who lines up between the center and the tackles on the offensive line of a football team on the line of scrimmage used primarily for blocking . Right guards ( RG ) is the term for the guards on the right of the offensive line , while left guards ( LG ) are on the left side . Guards are to the right or left of the center . The guard 's job is to protect the quarterback from the incoming linemen during pass plays , as well as creating openings ( holes ) for the running backs to head through . Guards are automatically considered ineligible receivers , so they can not intentionally touch a forward pass , unless it is to recover a fumble or is first touched by a defender or eligible receiver .",

Reese is considered to be the biggest draft bust in Buccaneers history . Reese played college football in Bethune-Cookman College and was drafted in the second round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Buccaneers . The Buccaneers intended to draft him in the first round , but a broken communication resulted in their mistakenly drafting Sean Farrell . They were so convinced of his talent that they traded a future first round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to get him , despite advance knowledge that 1983 would be a particularly strong draft class . Although highly talented , Reese had trouble making the mental adjustment to professional football . Frustration over his inability to excel , along with his unpreparedness for the NFL lifestyle , led to problems with alcohol and cocaine . Reese 's best season in the NFL came in 1983 . He played in all 16 games that season , scoring one sack and two interceptions . Reese only lasted two seasons with the Bucs before being traded to the Rams for a 12th round draft pick in 1984 . He played eleven games with the Rams , who then sent him to rehab and released him . He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1985 , but was released before the season after again failing a drug test .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
