  "/wiki/Pr\u00f3xima_Estaci\u00f3n:_Esperanza": "Pr\u00f3xima Estaci\u00f3n : Esperanza ( English : Next Stop : Hope ) is an album by Manu Chao . It was released in Europe in 2001 . It was released in the United States on 5 June 2001 on Virgin Records . Chao and others sing in Arabic , English , French , Galician , Portuguese and Spanish on this album . The backing track to Homens , a tight rap about various kinds of men , written and performed by Brazilian journalist ( and Chao 's friend ) Valeria dos Santos Costa , is identical to the backing track for Bongo Bong , Chao 's successful single from four years earlier ; however , in the short documentary film Infinita tristeza ( included within the bonus section of his 2002 live DVD Babylonia en Guagua ) , Chao stated that Homens was the song for which the well-known backing track was originally recorded . The final song on the album , Infinita Tristeza , does not contain any vocals by Chao , but it consists of the same backing track as Me Gustas T\u00fa , over which several samples and soundbites are layered ; most of them come from a cartoon-based TV documentary film about pregnancy and childbirth , produced in 1977 by TVE and aimed at children . A number of voice samples from the documentary are looped and repeated throughout the track in Chao 's typical fragmented style . The album title comes from a sample of an announcement for the Esperanza station of Madrid Metro 's Line 4 ; in Spanish esperanza means hope . Another Line 4 station , named Avenida de la Paz [ literally Peace Avenue ] is also mentioned several times on the album , but the two stations are actually several blocks apart , and the sample used by Chao actually consists of two separate announcements pasted together . The voice actor Javier Dot\u00fa and a Metro announcer later sued for infringement of intellectual property rights over the use of their voices . Pr\u00f3xima Estaci\u00f3n : Esperanza received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance . In 2010 Esperanza was listed at # 65 in Rolling Stone 's Best Albums of the Decade .",
