Its name comes from D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann , the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh , the capital of Scotland . The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago , surrounding the head of Otago Harbour , and the harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano . The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills , onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula , and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean . Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010 . Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by M\u0101ori prior to the arrival of Europeans . The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city . Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush , beginning in the 1860s . In the mid-1860s , and between 1878 and 1881 , it was New Zealand 's largest urban area . The city population at 5 March 2013 was 120,246 .",

Founded as a milling town in the 1850s , there has long been dispute as to the naming of the settlement . The town 's streets are named for prominent British poets , and it is possible that the town 's original intended name of Milltown became shortened by association with the poet of the same name .
