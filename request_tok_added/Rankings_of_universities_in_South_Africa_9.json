A brief history of Mangosuthu University of Technology The story of the establishment of MUT is one shaped by benevolence and empowerment of the disenfranchised . It begins in 1974 with Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi , former Prime-Minister in KwaZulu Homeland in apartheid South Africa . At a meeting with the Chairman of the Anglo American Corporation and De Beers Consolidated Mines , Mr Harry F Oppenheimer , Prince Buthelezi first put forward the idea of establishing a tertiary education institution specialising in technical subjects . The proposal was taken up by the Anglo American and De Beers Chairmans Fund , and , although funds were not immediately available to construct such an institution , research was commissioned to investigate the potential in South Africa for the training and employment of black technicians . This work was undertaken by the South African Labour and Development Research Unit ( SALDRU ) of the University of Cape Town , which analysed the enrolment of the then existing advanced technical education centres and calculated that the output of engineering technicians in 1976 was 1035 , whereas there was a demand for 3000 additional technicians per annum . Thus if black youths were to become available for training , an annual output of 2000 engineering technicians could be considered . SALDRU then ascertained the willingness of employers to employ black technicians if they were to become available . The response indicated that the categories most in immediate demand were mechanical , civil and construction , electrical , and chemical engineering . As the SALDRU study by Nigel Bloch showed that there was an immediate need and demand for black technicians , Mr Oppenheimer undertook that The Anglo American and De Beers group Chairmans Fund would provide R5 million to build the necessary facilities .",
