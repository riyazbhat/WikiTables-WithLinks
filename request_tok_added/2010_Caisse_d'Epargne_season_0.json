Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

  "/wiki/Vuelta_a_Mallorca": "The Challenge Vuelta Ciclista a Mallorca ( English : Tour of Majorca , Catalan : Challenge Volta Ciclista a Mallorca ) is a series of four ( five until 2012 ) professional one day road bicycle races held on the Spanish island of Mallorca in late January or early February . The event is used as an early season preparatory event by many of the top teams in readiness for the bigger races later in the season . The five races are ranked 1.1 on the UCI Europe Tour . Although the race styles itself as the Tour of Majorca it has never been allowed to be classed as a multi day stage race by the sports governing body the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) because the race rules allows riders not to participate on certain days if they dont want to . However , there is an unofficial overall classification winner taken on total time over five days . This laid back attitude by the race organisers makes the race popular with team managers who can bring a large squad ( sometimes as many as 20 riders ) and interchange them over the five days . Apart from the overall classification on time there are the usual Mountains , Points and Sprints competitions associated with any stage race . There is also a competition for the top Majorcan based rider , in the past this has been won by Vicente Reyn\u00e8s , Antonio Col\u00f3m and Antonio Tauler . The first day of racing is the Trofeo Mallorca which is a criterium ( circuit race ) around the streets of Palma . The second day is the Trofeo Cala Millor , sometimes called the Trofeo Alc\u00fadia . These two opening days are run over a fairly flat course and result in a sprint finish .
