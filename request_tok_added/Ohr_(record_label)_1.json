Tangerine Dream are considered pioneers of the early days of electronica . Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische ( cosmic ) . Their Virgin Years , so called because of their association with Virgin Records , produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers , including the UK top 20 albums Phaedra ( 1974 ) and Rubycon ( 1975 ) . The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks , creating over 60 scores , which include those for the films Sorcerer , Thief , Risky Business , The Keep , Firestarter , Legend , Three O'Clock High , Near Dark , Shy People , and Miracle Mile . From the late 1990s into the 2000s , Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica . Their recorded output has been prolific , including over one hundred albums . Among other scoring projects , they helped create the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new age ( although the band themselves disliked the term ) and electronic dance music ."
