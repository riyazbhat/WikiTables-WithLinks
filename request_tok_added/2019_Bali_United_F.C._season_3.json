  "/wiki/Own_goal": "An own goal is an event in competitive goal-scoring sports ( such as association football or hockey ) where a player scores on his or her own side of the playing area rather than the one defended by the opponent . Since own goals are often added to the opponent 's score , they are often an embarrassing blunder for the scoring player , but in certain sports are occasionally done for strategic reasons . In some parts of the world , the term has become a metaphor for any action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it , sometimes even carrying a sense of poetic justice . During The Troubles , for instance , it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in Belfast , referring to an IED ( improvised explosive device ) that detonated prematurely , killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others . A player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal . Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play .",
