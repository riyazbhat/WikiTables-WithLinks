  "/wiki/Folklore_of_the_United_States": "Folklore consists of legends , music , oral history , proverbs , jokes , popular beliefs , fairy tales , stories , tall tales , and customs that are the traditions of a culture , subculture , or group . It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared . The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics . In usage , there is a continuum between folklore and mythology . American folklore encompasses the folk traditions that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century . While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition , it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people .",
  "/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II": "The Allies of World War II , called the United Nations from the 1 January 1942 declaration , were the countries that together opposed the Axis powers during the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) . The Allies promoted the alliance as a means to control German , Japanese and Italian aggression . At the start of the war on 1 September 1939 , the Allies consisted of France , Poland and the United Kingdom , as well as their dependent states , such as British India . Within days they were joined by the independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth : Australia , Canada , New Zealand and South Africa . After the start of the German invasion of North Europe until the Balkan Campaign , the Netherlands , Belgium , Greece , and Yugoslavia joined the Allies . After first having cooperated with Germany in invading Poland whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict , the Soviet Union perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany . The United States provided war materiel and money all along , and officially joined in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . China had already been in a prolonged war with Japan since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 1937 , but officially joined the Allies in 1941 . The alliance was formalised by the Declaration by United Nations , from 1 January 1942 . However , the name United Nations was rarely used to describe the Allies during the war . The leaders of the Big Three - the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and the United States - controlled Allied strategy ; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close . The Big Three together with China were referred as a trusteeship of the powerful , then were recognized as the Allied Big Four in the Declaration by United Nations and later as the Four Policemen of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/Atlantis": "Atlantis ( Ancient Greek : \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 , island of Atlas ) is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato 's works Timaeus and Critias , where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges Ancient Athens , the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato 's ideal state in The Republic . In the story , Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world , supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato 's concept of a state . The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean . Despite its minor importance in Plato 's work , the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature . The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers , such as Francis Bacon 's New Atlantis and Thomas More 's Utopia . On the other hand , nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato 's narrative as historical tradition , most famously in Ignatius L. Donnelly 's Atlantis : The Antediluvian World . Plato 's vague indications of the time of the events - more than 9,000 years before his time - and the alleged location of Atlantis - beyond the Pillars of Hercules - has led to much pseudoscientific speculation . As a consequence , Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction , from comic books to films . While present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story 's fictional character , there is still debate on what served as its inspiration . As for instance with the story of Gyges , Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions . This led a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption , the Sea Peoples invasion , or the Trojan War . Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that Plato created an entirely fictional nation as his example , drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415-413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC .",
  "/wiki/Aztec_mythology": "Aztec mythology is the body or collection of myths of Aztec civilization of Central Mexico . The Aztecs were Nahuatl-speaking groups living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other Mesoamerican cultures . According to legend , the various groups who were to become the Aztecs arrived from the north into the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco . The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear - it is the heart of modern Mexico City - but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec . There are different accounts of their origin . In the myth the ancestors of the Mexica/Aztec came from a place in the north called Aztlan , the last of seven nahuatlacas ( Nahuatl-speaking tribes , from tlaca , man ) to make the journey southward , hence their name Azteca . Other accounts cite their origin in Chicomoztoc , the place of the seven caves , or at Tamoanchan ( the legendary origin of all civilizations ) . The Mexica/Aztec were said to be guided by their god Huitzilopochtli , meaning Left-handed Hummingbird or Hummingbird from the South . At an island in Lake Texcoco , they saw an eagle holding a rattlesnake in its talons , perched on a nopal cactus . This vision fulfilled a prophecy telling them that they should found their new home on that spot . The Aztecs built their city of Tenochtitlan on that site , building a great artificial island , which today is in the center of Mexico City . This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of Arms of Mexico .",
  "/wiki/Celestial_Bureaucracy": "Chinese theology , which comes in different interpretations according to the classic texts and the common religion , and specifically Confucian , Taoist and other philosophical formulations , is fundamentally monistic , that is to say it sees the world and the gods of its phenomena as an organic whole , or cosmos , which continuously emerges from a simple principle . This is expressed by the concept that all things have one and the same principle ( w\u00e0nw\u00f9 y\u012bl\u01d0 ) . This principle is commonly referred to as Ti\u0101n , a concept generally translated as Heaven , referring to the northern culmen and starry vault of the skies and its natural laws which regulate earthly phenomena and generate beings as their progenitors . Ancestors are therefore regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society , and therefore as the means connecting back to Heaven which is the utmost ancestral father ( z\u0113ngz\u01d4f\u00f9 ) . Chinese theology may be also called Ti\u0101nxu\u00e9 ( study of Heaven ) , a term already in use in the 17th and 18th century . The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as transcendent and immanent to creation , at the same time . The Chinese idea of the universal God is expressed in different ways ; there are many names of God from the different sources of Chinese tradition , reflecting a hierarchic , multiperspective observation of the supreme God . Chinese scholars emphasise that the Chinese tradition contains two facets of the idea of God : one is the personified God of popular devotion , and the other one is the impersonal God of philosophical inquiry . Together they express an integrated definition of the monistic world . Interest in traditional Chinese theology has waxed and waned over the various periods of the history of China . For instance , the Great Leap Forward enacted in the mid-20th century involved the outright destruction of traditional temples in accordance with Maoist ideology . From the 1980s onward , public revivals have taken place .",
  "/wiki/Egyptian_pantheon": "Ancient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt . The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion , which emerged sometime in prehistory . Deities represented natural forces and phenomena , and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat , or divine order . After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC , the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh , who claimed to be the gods ' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out . The gods ' complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities : family ties , loose groups and hierarchies , and combinations of separate gods into one . Deities ' diverse appearances in art - as animals , humans , objects , and combinations of different forms - also alluded , through symbolism , to their essential features . In different eras , various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society , including the solar deity Ra , the mysterious god Amun , and the mother goddess Isis . The highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun . Some scholars have argued , based in part on Egyptian writings , that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities . Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world , except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC , when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten . Gods were assumed to be present throughout the world , capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives . People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines , for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites .",
  "/wiki/Celtic_polytheism": "Ancient Celtic religion , commonly known as Celtic paganism , comprises the religious beliefs and practices adhered to by the Iron Age people of Western Europe now known as the Celts , roughly between 500 BCE and 500 CE , spanning the La T\u00e8ne period and the Roman era , and in the case of the Insular Celts the British and Irish Iron Age . Very little is known with any certainty about the subject , and apart from documented names that are thought to be of deities , the only detailed contemporary accounts are by hostile and probably not-well-informed Roman writers .",
  "/wiki/Twelve_Olympians": "In ancient Greek religion and mythology , the twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon , commonly considered to be Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Demeter , Athena , Apollo , Artemis , Ares , Hephaestus , Aphrodite , Hermes , and either Hestia or Dionysus . They were called Olympians because , according to tradition , they resided on Mount Olympus . Although Hades was a major ancient Greek god , and was the brother of the first generation of Olympians ( Zeus , Poseidon , Hera , Demeter , and Hestia ) , his realm was the underworld , far from Olympus , and thus was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians . Besides the twelve Olympians , there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods .",
  "/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)": "Deva ( ; Sanskrit : , ) means heavenly , divine , anything of excellence , and is also one of the terms for a deity in Hinduism . Deva is a masculine term ; the feminine equivalent is Devi . In the earliest Vedic literature , all supernatural beings are called Devas and Asuras . The concepts and legends evolve in ancient Indian literature , and by the late Vedic period , benevolent supernatural beings are referred to as Deva-Asuras . In post-Vedic texts , such as the Puranas and the Itihasas of Hinduism , the Devas represent the good , and the Asuras the bad . In some medieval Indian literature , Devas are also referred to as Suras and contrasted with their equally powerful but malevolent half-brothers , referred to as the Asuras . Devas , along with Asuras , Yakshas ( nature spirits ) and Rakshasas ( ghoulish ogres ) , are part of Indian mythology , and Devas feature in many cosmological theories in Hinduism .",
  "/wiki/Tuatha_D\u00e9_Danann": "The Tuath ( a ) D\u00e9 Danann ( , meaning the folk of the goddess Danu ) , also known by the earlier name Tuath D\u00e9 ( tribe of the gods ) , are a supernatural race in Irish mythology . They are thought to represent the main deities of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland . The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann constitute a pantheon whose attributes appeared in a number of forms throughout the Celtic world . The Tuath D\u00e9 dwell in the Otherworld but interact with humans and the human world . They are associated with ancient passage tombs , such as Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne , which were seen as portals to the Otherworld . Their traditional rivals are the Fomorians ( Fomoire ) , who seem to represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature , and who the Tuath D\u00e9 defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired . Each member of the Tuath D\u00e9 has associations with a particular feature of life or nature , but many appear to have more than one association . Many also have bynames , some representing different aspects of the deity and others being regional names or epithets . Much of Irish mythology was recorded by Christian monks , who modified it to an extent . They often depicted the Tuath D\u00e9 as kings , queens and heroes of the distant past who had supernatural powers . Other times they were explained as fallen angels who were neither good nor evil . However , some medieval writers acknowledged that they were gods .",

  "/wiki/Zoroastrianism": "Zoroastrianism or Mazdayasna is one of the world 's oldest continuously practiced religions . It is a multi-tendency faith centered on a dualistic cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology predicting the ultimate conquest of evil with theological elements of henotheism , monotheism/monism , and polytheism . Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian-speaking spiritual leader Zoroaster ( also known as Zarathushtra ) , it exalts an uncreated and benevolent deity of wisdom , Ahura Mazda ( Wise Lord ) , as its supreme being . Major features of Zoroastrianism , such as messianism , judgment after death , heaven and hell , and free will may have influenced other religious and philosophical systems , including Second Temple Judaism , Gnosticism , Greek philosophy , Christianity , Islam , the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , and Buddhism . With possible roots dating back to the second millennium BCE , Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the 5th century BCE . Along with a Mithraic Median prototype and a Zurvanist Sassanid successor , it served as the state religion of the ancient Iranian empires for more than a millennium , from around 600 BCE to 650 CE . Zoroastrianism declined from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of 633-654 . Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 110,000-120,000 , with most living in India and in Iran ; their number has been thought to be declining . The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta , which includes as central the writings of Zoroaster known as the Gathas , enigmatic ritual poems that define the religion 's precepts , which is within Yasna , the main worship service of modern Zoroastrianism . The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods of the Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition into ahuras and daevas , the latter of which were not considered worthy of worship . Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator , the creative and sustaining force of the universe through Asha , and that human beings are given a right of choice between supporting Ahura Mazda or not , making them responsible for their choices . Though Ahura Mazda has no equal contesting force , Angra Mainyu ( destructive spirit/mentality ) , whose forces are born from Aka Manah ( evil thought ) , is considered the main adversarial force of the religion , standing against Spenta Mainyu ( creative spirit/mentality ) ."
