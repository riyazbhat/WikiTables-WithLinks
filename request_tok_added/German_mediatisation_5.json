  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Westphalia": "The Kingdom of Westphalia was a kingdom in Germany , with a population of 2.6 million , that existed from 1807 to 1813 . It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany . While formally independent , it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon 's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte . It was named after Westphalia , but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area ; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia . Napoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany , a French-style central administration , and agricultural reform . The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial . In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany 's first laws granting Jews equal rights , thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states . Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms . The country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers . Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned . The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812 . When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813 , the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and ( in 1815 ) most of its territories became Prussian ruled .",

It was formally known as the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( ) . For most of its existence , the electorate was ruled in personal union with Great Britain following the Hanoverian Succession . The Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg had been split in 1269 between different branches of the House of Welf . The Principality of Calenberg , ruled by a cadet branch of the family , emerged as the largest and most powerful of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg states . In 1692 , the Holy Roman Emperor elevated the Prince of Calenberg to the College of Electors , creating the new Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg . The fortunes of the Electorate were tied to those of Great Britain by the Act of Settlement 1701 and Act of Union 1707 , which settled the succession to the British throne on Queen Anne 's nearest Protestant relative , the Electress Sophia of Hanover , and her descendants . The Prince-Elector of Hanover became King of Great Britain in 1714 . As a consequence , a reluctant Britain was forced time and again to defend the King 's German possessions . However , Hanover remained a separately ruled territory with its own governmental bodies , and the country had to sign a treaty with Great Britain whenever Hanoverian troops fought on the British side of a war . Merged into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807 , it was re-established as the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 , and the personal union with the British crown lasted until 1837 .",

Although France had already established an overseas colonial empire beginning in the 17th century , the French state had remained a kingdom under the Bourbons and a republic after the Revolution . Historians refer to Napoleon 's regime as the First Empire to distinguish it from the restorationist Second Empire ( 1852-1870 ) ruled by his nephew as Napoleon III . On 18 May 1804 , Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French ( L'Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais , pronounced [ l\u0251\u0303.p\u0281\u0153\u0281 de f\u0281\u0251\u0303.s\u025b ] ) by the French S\u00e9nat ( Senate ) and was crowned on 2 December 1804 , signifying the end of the French Consulate and of the French First Republic . The French Empire achieved military supremacy in mainland Europe through notable victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria , Prussia , Russia , and allied nations , notably at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 . French dominance was reaffirmed during the War of the Fourth Coalition , at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806 and the Battle of Friedland in 1807 . He was defeated during the 1815 battle of Waterloo . A series of wars , known collectively as the Napoleonic Wars , extended French influence to much of Western Europe and into Poland . At its height in 1812 , the French Empire had 130 departments , ruled over 70 million subjects , maintained an extensive military presence in Germany , Italy , Spain , and the Duchy of Warsaw , and counted Prussia and Austria as nominal allies . Early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe : the introduction of the Napoleonic Code throughout the continent increased legal equality , established jury systems and legalised divorce , and seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice were abolished , as were aristocratic privileges in all places except Poland . France 's defeat in 1814 ( and then again in 1815 ) , marked the end of the Empire .",

It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947 . For centuries , the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then , in 1701 , in Berlin , decisively shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , most German states ( notably excluding Austria and Switzerland ) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic - the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 .

In 1797 , France defeated the Holy Roman Empire and all lands west of the Rhine were lost . Following the defeat of Austria in December 1805 , most of the smaller German princely states were mediatized , with the glaring exception of Leyen , which was spared because the Count was nephew to Archchancellor Karl Theodor von Dalberg , a close collaborator of Napoleon 's . In 1806 , Count Philip Francis of Adendorf was raised to a Prince , and his lands were renamed to the 'Principality of Leyen ' . The territory formed an enclave surrounded by Baden . Prince Philip Francis , like many other members of the Confederation of the Rhine became largely a French puppet , so following Napoleon 's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 , the Congress of Vienna opted to mediatize his realm and give it to Austria .

  "/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna": "The Congress of Vienna ( , ) , also called Vienna Congress , was a meeting of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich , and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815 , though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814 . The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars . The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace . The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution , both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe . France lost all its recent conquests while Prussia , Austria and Russia made major territorial gains . Prussia added smaller German states in the west , Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony ; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy . Russia gained parts of Poland . The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before , and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium . The immediate background was Napoleonic France 's defeat and surrender in May 1814 , which brought an end to 23 years of nearly continuous war . Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon 's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March to July 1815 . The Congress 's final act was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815 . The Congress has often been criticized for causing the subsequent suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements , and it has been seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs .",
