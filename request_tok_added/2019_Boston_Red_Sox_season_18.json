A total of 30 teams play in the Triple-A International League ( IL ) and Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) , with 14 teams in the IL and 16 in the PCL .

Triple-A teams are typically located in large metropolitan areas that do not have Major League Baseball teams , such as San Antonio ; Austin ; Columbus ; and Indianapolis . Interleague play between the International League and Pacific Coast League occurs twice each season . In July , each league 's All-Star team competes in the Triple-A All-Star Game . In September each league 's regular season champions play each other in the Triple-A National Championship Game to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball . The Triple-A classification was created before the 1946 season . Prior to then , the top level of the minors had been designated as Double-A since 1912 .

  "/wiki/Pawtucket_Red_Sox": "The Pawtucket Red Sox ( known colloquially as the PawSox ) are a professional minor league baseball team based in Pawtucket , Rhode Island .

After enduring three different owners , at least two threats to move the team elsewhere , and bankruptcy , the PawSox were purchased from the International League by local industrialist Ben Mondor in January 1977 . Over the next 38 years , Mondor ( who died in 2010 ) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success ; it was twice ( 1990 and 2003 ) selected the winner of Baseball America 's Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball , led the league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008 , and won three Governors ' Cups as playoff champions . On February 23 , 2015 , the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox president and chief executive officer Larry Lucchino and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington . Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility ( first in adjacent Providence , then in a downtown site in Pawtucket ) , the PawSox announced on August 17 , 2018 , that they will move to Worcester , Massachusetts , away , in 2021 .
