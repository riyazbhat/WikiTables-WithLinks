  "/wiki/Package_Development_Process": "A software package development process is a system for developing software packages . Packages make it easier to reuse and share code , e.g. , via a software repository . A formal system for package checking can help expose bugs , thereby potentially making it easier to produce trustworthy software ( Chambers ' prime directive ) . This in turn can help improve productivity for people who produce and use software , as part of a software development process or software development methodology .",
  "/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)": "Haskell /\u02c8h\u00e6sk\u0259l/ is a general-purpose , statically typed , purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation . Developed to be suitable for teaching , research and industrial application , Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features . Type classes , for example , enable type-safe operator overloading , were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott for Standard ML and were first implemented in Haskell . Haskell 's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler . It is named after logician Haskell Curry . Haskell 's semantics are historically based on those of the Miranda programming language , which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group . The last formal specification of the language was made in July 2010 , while the development of GHC 's implementation has continued to extend Haskell via language extensions . The next formal specification is planned for 2020 . Haskell is used in academia and industry . As of September 2019 , Haskell was the 23rd most popular programming language in terms of Google searches for tutorials and made up less than 1% of active users on the GitHub source code repository .",

  "/wiki/Java_(software_platform)": "Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems , which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation , that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment . Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers . Java applets , which are less common than standalone Java applications , were commonly run in secure , sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages . Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages , including Ada , JavaScript , Python , and Ruby . In addition , several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM , including Clojure , Groovy , and Scala . Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++ , but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap ( while some implementations e.g . all currently supported by Oracle , may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead ) and all variables of object types are references . Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM . On November 13 , 2006 , Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in October 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version ( Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support ) , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java , because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 ( Java 12 is also an non-LTS option ) .",
  "/wiki/Apache_Maven": "Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects . Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C # , Ruby , Scala , and other languages . The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation , where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project . Maven addresses two aspects of building software : how software is built , and its dependencies . Unlike earlier tools like Apache Ant , it uses conventions for the build procedure , and only exceptions need to be written down . An XML file describes the software project being built , its dependencies on other external modules and components , the build order , directories , and required plug-ins . It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging . Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository , and stores them in a local cache . This local cache of downloaded artifacts can also be updated with artifacts created by local projects . Public repositories can also be updated . Maven is built using a plugin-based architecture that allows it to make use of any application controllable through standard input . A plugin for the .NET framework exists and is maintained , and a C/C++ native plugin is maintained for Maven 2 .",

  "/wiki/.NET": ".NET Framework ( pronounced as dot net ) is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows . It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library ( FCL ) and provides language interoperability ( each language can use code written in other languages ) across several programming languages . Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment ( in contrast to a hardware environment ) named the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) . The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security , memory management , and exception handling . As such , computer code written using .NET Framework is called managed code . FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework . FCL provides user interface , data access , database connectivity , cryptography , web application development , numeric algorithms , and network communications . Programmers produce software by combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries . The framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform . Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment largely for .NET software called Visual Studio . .NET Framework began as proprietary software , although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately , even before its first release . Despite the standardization efforts , developers , mainly those in the free and open-source software communities , expressed their unease with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation , especially regarding software patents .",

  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",

  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",

When writing , the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in What You See Is What You Get word processors like Microsoft Word , LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages . The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document ( such as article , book , and letter ) , to stylise text throughout a document ( such as bold and italics ) , and to add citations and cross-references . A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file ( such as PDF or DVI ) suitable for printing or digital distribution . Within the typesetting system , its name is stylised as LaTeX . LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields , including mathematics , statistics , computer science , engineering , chemistry , physics , economics , linguistics , quantitative psychology , philosophy , and political science . It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials , such as Sanskrit and Greek . LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output , and is itself written in the TeX macro language . LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system , or as an intermediate format . In the latter role , for example , it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF . The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing , including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures , chapter and section headings , the inclusion of graphics , page layout , indexing and bibliographies .
