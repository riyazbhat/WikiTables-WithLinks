While in the disco , Tony is the champion dancer . His circle of friends and weekend dancing help him to cope with the harsh realities of his life : a dead-end job , clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents , racial tensions in the local community , and his general restlessness . The story is based upon a 1976 New York magazine article by British writer Nik Cohn , Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night ; in the mid-1990s , Cohn acknowledged that he fabricated the article . A newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle , Cohn was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about ; instead , the character who became Tony Manero was based on an English mod acquaintance of Cohn . Saturday Night Fever was a huge commercial success . The film significantly helped to popularize disco music around the world and made Travolta , already well known from his role on TV 's Welcome Back , Kotter , a household name ; he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance .
