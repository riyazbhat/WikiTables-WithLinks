  "/wiki/Batsman": "In cricket , batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs or prevent the loss of one 's wicket . Any player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman , batswoman , or batter , regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise . Batting players have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches , especially in different countries - therefore , as well as having outstanding physical batting skills , top-level batters will have lightning reflexes , excellent decision-making and be good strategists . During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time : the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is denoted the striker , while the other is the non-striker . When a batting player is out , they are replaced by a teammate . This continues until the end of the innings , which is often when 10 of the team members are out , whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat . Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play . The main concerns for the batting players are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible . These objectives generally conflict - to score quickly , risky shots must be played , increasing the chance that the batting player will be dismissed , while the batting player 's safest choice with a careful wicket-guarding stroke may be not to attempt any runs at all . Depending on the situation , batting players may abandon attempts at run-scoring in an effort to preserve their wicket , or may attempt to score runs as quickly as possible with scant concern for the possibility of being dismissed . As with all other cricket statistics , batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a measure of a player 's effectiveness . The main statistic for batting is a player 's batting average .",
  "/wiki/Run_(cricket)": "In cricket , a run is the unit of scoring . The team with the most runs wins in many versions of the game , and always draws at worst ( see result ) , except for some results decided by the DLS method . One run ( known as a single ) is scored when a batsman ( known as the striker ) has hit the ball with the bat , or with a gloved hand holding the bat , and directed it away from the fielders so that both the striker and the non-striker are able to run the length of the pitch ( 22 yards ) , crossing each other and arriving safely at the other end of the pitch , before the fielders can retrieve the ball and hit the wicket . Depending on how long it takes the fielding team to recover the ball , the batsmen may run more than once . Each completed run increments the scores of both the team and the striker . A batsman may also score 4 or 6 runs by striking the ball to the boundary . The team 's total score in the innings is the aggregate of all its batsmen 's individual scores plus any extras . To complete a run , both batsmen must make their ground , with some part of their person or bat touching the ground behind the popping crease at the other end of the pitch . Attempting a run carries a risk factor because either batsman can be run out , ( one method of dismissal ) , if the fielding side can break the wicket with the ball before the batsman has completed the run .",
  "/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)": "A delivery or ball in cricket is a single action of bowling a cricket ball toward the batsman . During play of the game , a member of the fielding team is designated as the bowler , and bowls deliveries toward the batsman . Six legal balls in a row constitutes an over , after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over . The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the pitch toward the batsman standing at the opposite wicket at the other end of the pitch . Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed . This approach to their delivery , in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket ( from the sides of the wicket on the bowler 's end ) or over the wicket , is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware .",
  "/wiki/Strike_rate": "Strike rate refers to two different statistics in the sport of cricket . Batting strike rate is a measure of how quickly a batsman achieves the primary goal of batting , namely scoring runs . Bowling strike rate is a measure of how quickly a bowler achieves the primary goal of bowling , namely taking wickets ( i.e . getting batsmen out ) . Both strike rates are relatively new statistics , having only been invented and considered of importance after the introduction of One Day International cricket in the 1970s .",
