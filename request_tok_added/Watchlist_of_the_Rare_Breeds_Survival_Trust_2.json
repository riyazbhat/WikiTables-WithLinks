  "/wiki/North_Ronaldsay_sheep": "The North Ronaldsay or Orkney is a breed of sheep from North Ronaldsay , the northernmost island of Orkney , off the north coast of Scotland . It belongs to the Northern European short-tailed sheep group of breeds , and has evolved without much cross-breeding with modern breeds . It is a smaller sheep than most , with the rams ( males ) horned and ewes ( females ) mostly hornless . It was formerly kept primarily for wool , but now the two largest flocks are feral , one on North Ronaldsay and another on the Orkney island of Linga Holm . The Rare Breeds Survival Trust lists the breed as vulnerable , with fewer than 600 registered breeding females in the United Kingdom . The semi-feral flock on North Ronaldsay is the original flock that evolved to subsist almost entirely on seaweed - they are one of few mammals to do this . They are confined to the shoreline by a 1.8 m ( 6 ft ) tall drystane dyke , which completely encircles the island , forcing the sheep to evolve this unusual characteristic . The wall was built as kelping ( the production of soda ash from seaweed ) on the shore became uneconomical . Sheep were confined to the shore to protect the fields and crofts inside , and afterwards subsisted largely on seaweed . This diet has caused a variety of adaptations in the sheep 's digestive system . These sheep have to extract the trace element copper far more efficiently than other breeds as their diet has a limited supply of copper . This results in them being susceptible to copper toxicity , if fed on a grass diet , as copper is toxic to sheep in high quantities .",
