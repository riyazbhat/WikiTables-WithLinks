Located in the central part of the country , it has a population of 682,679 ( 2019 ) . It is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship , and is located approximately 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) south-west of Warsaw . The city 's coat of arms is an example of canting , as it depicts a boat ( \u0142\u00f3d\u017a in Polish ) , which alludes to the city 's name . \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was once a small settlement that first appeared in written records in around 1332 . In the early 15th century it was granted city rights , but remained a rather small and insubstantial town . It was the property of Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century , when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by Prussia as a result of the second partition of Poland . Following the collapse of the independent Duchy of Warsaw , the city became part of Congress Poland , a client state of the Russian Empire . It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in the cloth industry and in population due to the inflow of migrants , most notably Germans and Jews . Ever since the industrialization of the area , the city has struggled with many difficulties such as multinationalism and social inequality , which were vividly documented in the novel The Promised Land written by Polish Nobel Prize-winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont . The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city , where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses . After Poland regained its independence in 1918 , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew to be one of the largest Polish cities and one of the most multicultural and industrial centers in Europe .",
