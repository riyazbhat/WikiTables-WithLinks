  "/wiki/Alma_mater": "Alma mater ( Latin : alma mater , lit . 'nourishing mother ' ; pl . [ rarely used ] almae matres ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university , school , or college that one formerly attended . In US usage , it can also mean the school from which one graduated . The phrase is variously translated as nourishing mother , nursing mother , or fostering mother , suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students . Before its current usage , alma mater was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses , especially Ceres or Cybele , and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary . It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum ( nurturing mother of studies ) , which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world . It is related to alumnus , a term used for a university graduate that literally means a nursling or one who is nourished .",
