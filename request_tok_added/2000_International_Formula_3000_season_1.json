On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers ' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and , if it were , would probably not occur at Silverstone . However , on 9 December an agreement was reached with Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone ensuring that the track would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 after which Donington Park would become the new host . However , the Donington Park leaseholders , Donington Ventures Leisure , ran into severe financial problems and went into administration , resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract , meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix , would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit . Although there was speculation of a street race in London , lengthy negotiations with Liberty Media have led to a new agreement for Silverstone to continue to host the British Grand Prix for a further five years after 2019 .
