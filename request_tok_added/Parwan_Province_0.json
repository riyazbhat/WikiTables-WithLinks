They primarily live in Afghanistan and Pakistan . A substantial majority of ethnic Pashtuns share Pashto - an Eastern Iranic language in the Indo-European language family - as the native language . Globally , the Pashtuns are estimated to number around 50 million , but an accurate count remains elusive due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 . The majority of the Pashtuns live in the region regarded as Pashtunistan , which has been split between two countries since the Durand Line border was formed after the Second Anglo-Afghan War . The Pashtuns are a significant minority group in Pakistan , where they constitute the second-largest ethnic group or about 15 percent of the population . Smaller , but still significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist in Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan , especially in the cities of Karachi and Lahore , and in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh , India . A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf , primarily in the United Arab Emirates . As the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan ( anywhere between 42 and 60 percent of the population ) , Pashtuns have been the dominant ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years . During the Delhi Sultanate era , the 15th-16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty . Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century , which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani . The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires .",

Tajiks are the largest ethnicity in Tajikistan , and the second largest in Afghanistan which constitutes over half of the global Tajik population . They speak varieties of Persian , a Western Iranian language . In Tajikistan , since the 1939 Soviet census , its small Pamiri and Yaghnobi ethnic groups are included as Tajiks . In China , the term is used to refer to its Pamiri ethnic groups , the Tajiks of Xinjiang , who speak the Eastern Iranian Pamiri languages . In Afghanistan , the Pamiris are counted as a separate ethnic group . As a self-designation , the literary New Persian term Tajik , which originally had some previous pejorative usage as a label for eastern Persians or Iranians , has become acceptable during the last several decades , particularly as a result of Soviet administration in Central Asia . Alternative names for the Tajiks are Eastern Persian , F\u0101rs\u012bw\u0101n ( Persian-speaker ) , and D\u012bhg\u0101n ( cf . Tajik : \u0414\u0435\u04b3\u049b\u043e\u043d ) which translates to farmer or settled villager , in a wider sense settled in contrast to nomadic and was later used to describe a class of land-owning magnates as Persian of noble blood in contrast to Arabs , Turks and Romans during the Sassanid and early Islamic period .",
