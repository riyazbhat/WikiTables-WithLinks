He wrote numerous songs , such as Pancho and Lefty , For the Sake of the Song , Tecumseh Valley , Rex 's Blues , and To Live Is to Fly , that are widely considered masterpieces of American folk music . His musical style has often been described as melancholy and features rich , poetic lyrics . During his early years , Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and fingerpicking ability . In 1983 , six years after Emmylou Harris had first popularized it , Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covered his song Pancho and Lefty , reaching number one on the Billboard country music chart . Much of Van Zandt 's life was spent touring various dive bars , often living in cheap motel rooms and backwood cabins . For much of the 1970s , he lived in a simple shack without electricity or a phone . His influence has been cited by countless artists across multiple genres , and his music has been recorded or performed by Bob Dylan , Willie Nelson , Merle Haggard , Norah Jones , Emmylou Harris , Counting Crows , Steve Earle , Robert Earl Keen Jr. , Nanci Griffith , Guy Clark , Wade Bowen , Gillian Welch , Pat Green , Colter Wall , Jason Isbell , Calvin Russell , Natalie Maines , and Frank Turner . He suffered from a series of drug addictions , alcoholism , and was given a psychiatric diagnosis of bipolar disorder . When he was young , the now-discredited insulin shock therapy erased much of his long-term memory .
