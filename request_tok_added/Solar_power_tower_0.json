  "/wiki/Crescent_Dunes_Solar_Energy_Project": "The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project is a 110 megawatt ( MW ) net solar thermal power project with 1.1 gigawatt-hours of energy storage , located near Tonopah , about northwest of Las Vegas . It substantially missed its intended power production by only achieving about 40% of its planned amount , resulting in lawsuits and changes of control . Following its sole customer contract termination , the site has not produced power since April 2019 . Crescent Dunes was the first concentrated solar power ( CSP ) plant with a central receiver tower and advanced molten salt energy storage technology from SolarReserve . The Crescent Dunes project , developed by SolarReserve and owned by Tonopah Solar Energy , LLC , was anticipated to cost less than $ 1 billion and was backed by a $ 737 million in U.S. government loan guarantees . Due to the course of actual events , as of October 2019 a filing for bankruptcy has been stated as a possible outcome .",
  "/wiki/PS20_solar_power_tower": "The PS20 solar power plant ( PS20 ) solar power plant is a solar thermal energy plant in Sanlucar la Mayor near Seville in Andalusia , Spain . It was the world 's most powerful solar power tower until the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in California became operational in 2014 . The 20 megawatt ( MW ) solar power tower produces electricity with large movable mirrors called heliostats . Construction of PS20 was started in 2006 and it commenced operation in 2009 . It features several significant technological improvements over the earlier PS10 . These include a receiver with higher efficiency , various improvements in the control and operational systems , and a better thermal energy storage system . PS20 consists of a solar field of 1,255 mirrored heliostats designed by Abengoa Solar . Each heliostat , with a surface area of , reflects the solar radiation it receives onto the receiver , located on the top of a tower , producing steam which is converted into electricity by a turbine generator . The remaining power plants will be built over the next few years . They will include low- and high-concentration photovoltaic , tower thermoelectric , parabolic-trough collector and Stirling dish plants . Abengoa Solar 's parabolic trough plants , Solnova 1 , 3 and 4 , which can generate 150 MW of power , are under construction at the Solar Platform . Resulting from cooperation between Ciemat , the IDEA , and the University of Seville , the whole plant is to be completed by 2013 , when it will produce approximately 300 MW - energy for around 180,000 homes , equivalent to the needs of the city of Seville .",

Abengoa claim it is the first thermal solar tower plant in Africa and the first tower plant to achieve 24 hours of operation with solar energy only , but that thanks to the decline in power demand at night , since full power storage lasts only 2 hours . The KSO is an evolution of the PS10 and PS20 projects , operating since 2007 and 2009 respectively in Spain . KSO solar field is made of more than 4,000 heliostats , totaling up to of mirror surface , focusing solar energy on a boiler located on top a centralized tower . KSO uses a superheated steam cycle that should be able to reach a maximum operating temperature of 530 \u00b0C . Accumulated saturated steam is also used to provide up to two hours of thermal storage at the plant . KSO condenser is cooled with a dry cooling system , a natural draft condenser that uses towers to distribute air across fin blades in order to dissipate heat .
