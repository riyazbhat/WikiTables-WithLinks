  "/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type": "The Jaguar E-Type , or the Jaguar XK-E for the North American market , is a British sports car that was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1975 . Its combination of beauty , high performance , and competitive pricing established the model as an icon of the motoring world . The E-Type 's claimed 150 mph ( 241 km/h ) top speed , sub-7-second 0 to 60 mph ( 97 km/h ) acceleration , monocoque construction , disc brakes , rack-and-pinion steering , and independent front and rear suspension distinguished the car and spurred industry-wide changes . The E-Type was based on Jaguar 's D-Type racing car , which had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans three consecutive years beginning 1955 , and employed what was , for the early 1960s , a novel racing design principle , with a front subframe carrying the engine , front suspension and front bodywork bolted directly to the body tub . No ladder frame chassis , as was common at the time , was needed and as such the first cars weighed only 1315kg ( 2900 lb ) . On its release in March 1961 Enzo Ferrari called it the most beautiful car ever made . In 2004 , Sports Car International magazine placed the E-Type at number one on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s . In March 2008 , the Jaguar E-Type ranked first in The Daily Telegraph online list of the world 's 100 most beautiful cars of all time . Outside automotive circles , the E-type received prominent placement in Diabolik comic series , Austin Powers films and the television series Mad Men .",

  "/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette": "The Chevrolet Corvette , colloquially known as the Vette , is a historically front engine , rear drive , two-door , two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet across more than 60 years of production and seven design generations - with GM confirming in early 2019 an eighth generation Corvette in a rear-mid-engine configuration . With its generations noted sequentially from C1 to C8 , the Corvette serves as Chevrolet 's halo vehicle and is widely noted for its performance and distinctive plastic - either fiberglass or composite - bodywork . In 1953 , when GM executives were looking to name the new Chevrolet sports car , assistant director for the Public Relations department Myron Scott suggested Corvette after the small maneuverable warship - and the name was approved . The first model , a convertible , was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept and was followed ten years later by the 1963 second generation , in coupe and convertible styles . Originally manufactured in Flint , Michigan , as well as St. Louis , Missouri , the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 in Bowling Green , Kentucky . The Corvette has since become widely known as America 's Sports Car . Automotive News said that after 'starring ' in the early 1960s television show Route 66 , the Corvette became synonymous with freedom and adventure , ultimately becoming both the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports car in history .",
  "/wiki/Austin-Healey_Sprite": "The Austin-Healey Sprite is a small open sports car which was produced in the United Kingdom from 1958 to 1971 . The Sprite was announced to the press in Monte Carlo by the British Motor Corporation on 20 May 1958 , two days after that year 's Monaco Grand Prix . It was intended to be a low-cost model that a chap could keep in his bike shed , yet be the successor to the sporting versions of the pre-war Austin Seven . The Sprite was designed by the Donald Healey Motor Company , with production being undertaken at the MG factory at Abingdon . It first went on sale at a price of \u00a3669 , using a tuned version of the Austin A-Series engine and as many other components from existing cars as possible to keep costs down . When the Mk . II Sprite was introduced in 1961 it was joined by a badge-engineered MG version , the Midget , reviving a model name used by MG from the late 1920s through to the mid 1950s . Enthusiasts often refer to these later Sprites and Midgets collectively as Spridgets . The MG-badged version of the car continued in production for several years after the Austin-Healey brand ceased to exist .",
