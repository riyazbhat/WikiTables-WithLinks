  "/wiki/Fibro": "Asbestos cement , genericized as fibro or fibrolite - short for fibrous ( or fibre ) cement sheet - and AC sheet , is a building material in which asbestos fibres are used to reinforce thin rigid cement sheets . The material rose to necessity during World War II to make sturdy , inexpensive military housing , and continued to be used as an affordable substitute for many roofing products following the war . Advertised as a fireproof alternative to other roofing materials such as asphalt , asbestos-cement roofs were popular not only for safety but also for affordability . Due to asbestos-cements imitation of more expensive materials such as wood siding and shingles , brick , slate , and stone , the product was marketed as an affordable renovation material . Asbestos-cement faced competition with the aluminum alloy , available in large quantities after WWII , and the reemergence of wood clapboard and vinyl siding in the mid to late twentieth century . Asbestos-cement is usually formed into flat or corrugated sheets or piping , but can be molded into any shape wet cement can fit . In Europe , many forms were historically used for cement sheets , while the US leaned more conservative in material shapes due to labor and production costs . Although fibro was used in a number of countries , it was in Australia and New Zealand where its use was the most widespread . Predominantly manufactured and sold by James Hardie & Co. until the mid-1980s , fibro in all its forms was a very popular building material , largely due to its durability . The reinforcing fibres involved in construction were almost always asbestos . The use of fibro that contains asbestos has been banned in several countries , including Australia . As recently as 2016 , the material has been discovered in new components sold for construction projects .",
