  "/wiki/The_Blue_Danube": "The Blue Danube is the common English title of , Op . 314 ( German for On the Beautiful Blue Danube ) , a waltz by the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II , composed in 1866 . Originally performed on 15 February 1867 at a concert of the ( Vienna Men 's Choral Association ) , it has been one of the most consistently popular pieces of music in the classical repertoire . Its initial performance was considered only a mild success , however , and Strauss is reputed to have said , The devil take the waltz , my only regret is for the coda - I wish that had been a success ! After the original music was written , the words were added by the Choral Association 's poet , Joseph Weyl . Strauss later added more music , and Weyl needed to change some of the words . Strauss adapted it into a purely orchestral version for the 1867 Paris World 's Fair , and it became a great success in this form . The instrumental version is by far the most commonly performed today . An alternate text was written by Franz von Gernerth , ( Danube so blue ) . The Blue Danube premiered in the United States in its instrumental version on 1 July 1867 in New York , and in Great Britain in its choral version on 21 September 1867 in London at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden . When Strauss 's stepdaughter , Alice von Meyszner-Strauss , asked the composer Johannes Brahms to sign her autograph-fan , he wrote down the first bars of The Blue Danube , but adding Leider nicht von Johannes Brahms ( Alas ! not by Johannes Brahms ) .",

He composed over 500 waltzes , polkas , quadrilles , and other types of dance music , as well as several operettas and a ballet . In his lifetime , he was known as The Waltz King , and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century . Strauss had two younger brothers , Josef and Eduard Strauss , who became composers of light music as well , although they were never as well known as their older brother . Some of Johann Strauss 's most famous works include The Blue Danube , Kaiser-Walzer ( Emperor Waltz ) , Tales from the Vienna Woods , and the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka . Among his operettas , Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the best known .",
  "/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini": "Gioachino Antonio Rossini [ n 1 ] [ n 2 ] ( 29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868 ) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas , although he also wrote many songs , some chamber music and piano pieces , and some sacred music . He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties , at the height of his popularity . Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians ( his father a trumpeter , his mother a singer ) , Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in Bologna . His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old . In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples . In the period 1810-1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice , Milan , Ferrara , Naples and elsewhere ; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components ( such as overtures ) and a certain amount of self-borrowing . During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas L'italiana in Algeri , Il barbiere di Siviglia ( known in English as The Barber of Seville ) and La Cenerentola , which brought to a peak the opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa . He also composed opera seria works such as Otello , Tancredi and Semiramide . All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody , harmonic and instrumental colour , and dramatic form . In 1824 he was contracted by the Op\u00e9ra in Paris , for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X , Il viaggio a Reims ( later cannibalised for his first opera in French , Le comte Ory ) , revisions of two of his Italian operas , Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe and Mo\u00efse , and in 1829 his last opera , Guillaume Tell . Rossini 's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained ; contributary factors may have been ill-health , the wealth his success had brought him , and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer . From the early 1830s to 1855 , when he left Paris and was based in Bologna , Rossini wrote relatively little .",
