  "/wiki/Inadmissible_Evidence": "Inadmissible Evidence is a play written by John Osborne in 1964 . It was also filmed in 1968 . The protagonist of the play is William Maitland , a 39-year-old English solicitor who has come to hate his entire life . Much of the play consists of lengthy monologues in which Maitland tells the audience about his life , a life he now regards as an utter failure . He readily acknowledges that he is bored with his wife and children , and just as bored by the petty , meaningless love affairs he 's been carrying on with other women . His career revolves around sordid divorce cases , and he 's come to despise both his clients and his colleagues . Maitland drinks heavily , and enjoys bullying and insulting everyone he comes into contact with . In Act One , like a prosecutor presenting a case , Maitland brutally shows the audience the utter despair and mediocrity of his life . In Act Two , Maitland 's crimes receive their due punishment , as he is deserted by everyone he ever cared about , including his clerk , his mistress and his wife . At times the play uses the technique of intercut monologues , which are arranged like dialogue but involve no communication between the characters . The role of Maitland was created by Nicol Williamson who played the role in Anthony Page 's original Royal Court production , in its Broadway debut , and in the 1968 movie version . In 1965 the play transferred to Wyndham 's Theatre in London 's West End .",
