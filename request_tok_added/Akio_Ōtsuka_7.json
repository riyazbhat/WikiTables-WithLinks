  "/wiki/Revenge": "Revenge is defined as the act of committing a harmful action against a person or group in response to a grievance , be it real or perceived . It is used to punish a wrong by going outside the law . Francis Bacon described revenge as a kind of wild justice that does . offend the law [ and ] putteth the law out of office . Primitive justice or retributive justice is often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as distributive justice and divine judgment .",
  "/wiki/Knight": "A knight is a man granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch , bishop or other political or religious leader for service to the monarch or a Christian church , especially in a military capacity . Historically , in Europe , knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors . During the High Middle Ages , knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility . By the Late Middle Ages , the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry , a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior . Often , a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter , a bodyguard or a mercenary for a lord , with payment in the form of land holdings . The lords trusted the knights , who were skilled in battle on horseback . Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship ( and especially the joust ) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century . This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry , cavalier and related terms . The special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Muslim world , and the Greek hippeis ( \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 ) and Roman eques of classical antiquity . In the late medieval period , new methods of warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete , but the titles remained in many nations . The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature , particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France , relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms , the paladins , and the Matter of Britain , relating to the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table . Today , a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches , as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories , such as the Roman Catholic Order of the Holy Sepulchre and Order of Malta , the Protestant Order of Saint John , as well as the English Order of the Garter , the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim , and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav .",

  "/wiki/Atlantic_canary": "The Atlantic canary ( Serinus canaria ) , known worldwide simply as the wild canary and also called the island canary , canary , or common canary , is a small passerine bird belonging to the genus Serinus in the finch family , Fringillidae . It is native to the Canary Islands , the Azores , and Madeira . Wild birds are mostly yellow-green , with brownish streaking on the back .

  "/wiki/Digital_camera": "A digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory . Most cameras produced today are digital , and while there are still dedicated digital cameras , many more cameras are now being incorporated into mobile devices , portable touchscreen computers , which can , among many other purposes , use their cameras to initiate live video-telephony and directly edit and upload imagery to others . However , high-end , high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals . Digital and movie cameras share an optical system , typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device . The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the image , just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical . However , unlike film cameras , digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded , and store and delete images from memory . Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound . Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing .",
  "/wiki/Yellow": "Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light . It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570-590 nm . It is a primary color in subtractive color systems , used in painting or color printing . In the RGB color model , used to create colors on television and computer screens , yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity . Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves , corn , canaries , daffodils , and lemons , as well as egg yolks , buttercups , and bananas . They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage . Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon , due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths ( green , blue , and violet ) . Because it was widely available , yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art ; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old . Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs , then in the murals in Roman villas . In the early Christian church , yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom , but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics . In the 20th century , Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star . In China , bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom , and could be worn only by the emperor and his household ; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet .",

  "/wiki/Axe": "An axe ( sometimes ax in American English ; see spelling differences ) is an implement that has been used for millennia to shape , split and cut wood , to harvest timber , as a weapon , and as a ceremonial or heraldic symbol . The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of an axe head with a handle , or helve . Before the modern axe , the stone-age hand axe was used from 1.5 million years BP without a handle . It was later fastened to a wooden handle . The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of stone with some form of wooden handle attached ( hafted ) in a method to suit the available materials and use . Axes made of copper , bronze , iron and steel appeared as these technologies developed . Axes are usually composed of a head and a handle . The axe is an example of a simple machine , as it is a type of wedge , or dual inclined plane . This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper . It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade . The handle of the axe also acts as a lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge - not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe . For fine chopping using a side axe this sometimes is a positive effect , but for felling with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency .",
  "/wiki/Vikings": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

  "/wiki/Water": "Water is an inorganic , transparent , tasteless , odorless , and nearly colorless chemical substance , which is the main constituent of Earth 's hydrosphere and the fluids of most living organisms . It is vital for all known forms of life , even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Its chemical formula is H2O , meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms , connected by covalent bonds . Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure . It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog . Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice , its solid state . When finely divided , crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow . The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor . Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation , transpiration ( evapotranspiration ) , condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea . Water covers 71% of the Earth 's surface , mostly in seas and oceans . Small portions of water occur as groundwater ( 1.7% ) , in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland ( 1.7% ) , and in the air as vapor , clouds ( formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air ) , and precipitation ( 0.001% ) .

Mors is sometimes erroneously identified with Orcus , whose Greek equivalent was Horkos , God of the Oath .",
  "/wiki/Killer_whale": "The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . Killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . Some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . They have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales . Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them . A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world 's oceans in a variety of marine environments , from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas , absent only from the Baltic and Black seas , and some areas of the Arctic Ocean . Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups ( pods ) which are the most stable of any animal species . Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours , which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations , have been described as manifestations of animal culture . The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca 's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species . Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion , habitat loss , pollution ( by PCBs ) , capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries . In late 2005 , the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters , were placed on the U.S . Endangered Species list .",

He appears to have been worshipped as a fertility god in Ebla , Assyria , Ugarit , and among the Amorites . The Hebrew Bible mentions him as the national god of the Philistines with temples at Ashdod and elsewhere in Gaza . A long-standing association with a Canaanite word for fish ( as in , Tib . ) , perhaps going back to the Iron Age , has led to an interpretation as a fish-god , and the association of merman motifs in Assyrian art ( such as the Dagon relief found by Austen Henry Layard in the 1840s ) . The god 's name was , however , more likely derived from a word for grain , suggesting that he was in origin associated with fertility and agriculture .",

  "/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)": "Taurus ( Latin for the Bull ) is one of the constellations of the zodiac , which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic . Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere 's winter sky . It is one of the oldest constellations , dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox . Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer , Akkad , Assyria , Babylon , Egypt , Greece , and Rome . A number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers . Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth , the Pleiades and the Hyades , both of which are visible to the naked eye . At first magnitude , the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation . In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1 , more commonly known as the Crab Nebula . One of the closest regions of active star formation , the Taurus-Auriga complex , crosses into the northern part of the constellation . The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars .",
  "/wiki/Cattle": "Cattle , or cows , are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates . They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae , are the most widespread species of the genus Bos , and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus . Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat ( beef or veal , see beef cattle ) , for milk ( see dairy cattle ) , and for hides , which are used to make leather . They are used as riding animals and draft animals ( oxen or bullocks , which pull carts , plows and other implements ) . Another product of cattle is dung , which can be used to create manure or fuel . In some regions , such as parts of India , cattle have significant religious meaning . Cattle , mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu , are also kept as pets . Around 10,500 years ago , cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central Anatolia , the Levant and Western Iran . According to an estimate from 2011 , there are 1.4 billion cattle in the world . In 2009 , cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome .",
  "/wiki/Black": "Black is the darkest color , the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light . It is an achromatic color , a color without hue , like white and gray . It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness , while white represents light . Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil , the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment , and night versus day . Since the Middle Ages , black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority , and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates , including the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court . Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings . In the 14th century , it was worn by royalty , clergy , judges and government officials in much of Europe . It became the color worn by English romantic poets , businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century , and a high fashion color in the 20th century . In the Roman Empire , it became the color of mourning , and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death , evil , witches and magic . According to surveys in Europe and North America , it is the color most commonly associated with mourning , the end , secrets , magic , force , violence , evil , and elegance . Black ink is the most common color used for printing books , newspapers and documents , as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus the easiest color to read . Similarly , black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens .",
  "/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)": "A genetic chimerism or chimera ( or , also chimaera ( chim\u00e6ra ) ) is a single organism composed of cells with distinct genotypes . In animals , this means an individual derived from two or more zygotes , which can include possessing blood cells of different blood types , subtle variations in form ( phenotype ) and , if the zygotes were of differing sexes , then even the possession of both female and male sex organs ( this is just one of many different phenomena that may result in intersexuality ) . Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs . In plant chimeras , however , the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same zygote , and the difference is often due to mutation during ordinary cell division . Normally , genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection ; however , it has been detected in the course of proving parentage . Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by organ transplantation , giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome . For example , transplantation of bone marrow often determines the recipient 's ensuing blood type .",
  "/wiki/Gorilla": "Gorillas are ground-dwelling , predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa . The genus Gorilla is divided into two species : the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas ( both critically endangered ) , and either four or five subspecies . They are the largest living primates . The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans , from 95 to 99% depending on what is included , and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos . Gorillas ' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa . Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa , gorillas cover a wide range of elevations . The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes , ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres ( 7,200 to 14,100 ft ) . Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level , with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda .",
  "/wiki/Tiger": "The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside . It is an apex predator , primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar . It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands . Since the early 20th century , tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China . Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra . The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 . As of 2015 , the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other . Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching . This , coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .",

Three species are currently recognised : the African bush elephant , the African forest elephant , and the Asian elephant . Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea ; extinct members include the mastodons . The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups , including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants . African elephants have larger ears and concave backs , whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears , and convex or level backs . Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk , tusks , large ear flaps , massive legs , and tough but sensitive skin . The trunk , also called a proboscis , is used for breathing , bringing food and water to the mouth , and grasping objects . Tusks , which are derived from the incisor teeth , serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging . The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication . The pillar-like legs carry their great weight . Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats , including savannahs , forests , deserts , and marshes . They are herbivorous , and they stay near water when it is accessible .",
  "/wiki/Sturgeon": "Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae . Their evolution dates back to the Triassic period some 245 to 208 million years ago . The family is grouped into four genera : Acipenser , Huso , Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus . Four species may now be extinct . Two closely related species , Polyodon spathula ( American paddlefish ) and Psephurus gladius ( Chinese paddlefish , possibly extinct ) are of the same order , Acipenseriformes , but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be true sturgeons . Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as primitive fishes because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record . Sturgeons are native to subtropical , temperate and sub-Arctic rivers , lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America . Sturgeons are long-lived , late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics , such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to those of sharks , and an elongated , spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned , scaleless , and armored with five lateral rows of bony plates called scutes . Several species can grow quite large , typically ranging in length . The largest sturgeon on record was a beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827 , weighing and long . Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders , which migrate upstream to spawn , but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries . Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively , while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas , and are known to venture into open ocean .",
  "/wiki/Safe": "A safe ( also called a strongbox or coffer ) is a secure lockable box used for securing valuable objects against theft and/or damage from fire . A safe is usually a hollow cuboid or cylinder , with one face being removable or hinged to form a door . The body and door may be cast from metal ( such as steel ) or formed out of plastic through blow molding . Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter , have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it , and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers/and or thieves . One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around . A less secure version ( only suitable for petty cash ) is usually called a cash-box ."
