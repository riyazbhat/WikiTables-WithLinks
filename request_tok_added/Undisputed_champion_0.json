There were attempts by boxing promoters in the 1920s to establish this weight class , but few sanctioning organizations or state athletic commissions would recognize it . Jack Wolf won recognition as champion when he beat Joe Lynch at Madison Square Garden on September 21 , 1922 , but afterwards the weight division fell into disuse .

The World Boxing Association crowned its first champion in 1977 when Soo Hwan Hong knocked out Hector Carasquilla in three rounds to win the inaugural WBA championship . In 1983 the International Boxing Federation sanctioned the bout between Bobby Berna and Seung-In Suh for its first title . Berna won in the eleventh round .
