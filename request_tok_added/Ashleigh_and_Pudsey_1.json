The sixth series was won by dancing dog act Ashleigh and Pudsey , with opera duo Jonathan and Charlotte finishing in second place , and Welsh choir Only Boys Aloud placing third ; all three along with many of the semi-finalists that took part in the competition were considered some of the best in the programme 's history by 2012 .
