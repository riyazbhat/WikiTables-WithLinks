  "/wiki/Xbox_(console)": "The Xbox is a home video game console and the first installment in the Xbox series of video game consoles manufactured by Microsoft . It was released as Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market on November 15 , 2001 , in North America , followed by Australia , Europe and Japan in 2002 . It is classified as a sixth generation console , competing with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 's GameCube . It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996 . Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",
  "/wiki/Kinect": "Kinect ( codenamed Project Natal during development ) is a line of motion sensing input devices produced by Microsoft . Initially , the Kinect was developed as a gaming accessory for Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles and Microsoft Windows PCs . Based around a webcam-style add-on peripheral , it enabled users to control and interact with their console/computer without the need for a game controller , through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands . While the gaming line did not gain much traction and eventually discontinued , third-party developers and researches found several after-market uses for Kinect 's advanced low-cost sensor features , leading Microsoft to drive the product line towards more application-neutral uses , including integrating the device with Microsoft 's cloud computing platform Azure . The first-generation Kinect for Xbox 360 was introduced in November 2010 in an attempt to broaden the console 's audience beyond its typical gamer base . Microsoft released a beta version of the Kinect software development kit for Windows 7 applications on June 16 , 2011 , initially supporting the Kinect for Xbox 360 hardware connected to a PC for non-commercial applications . This SDK was meant to allow developers to write Kinect apps in C++/CLI , C # , or Visual Basic .NET . A similar hardware version Kinect for Windows was released on February 1 , 2012 . The 1.0 version of the Windows SDK , allowing commercial applications , was released with and required the Kinect for Windows hardware . Kinect for Xbox One , a new version with significantly expanded hardware capabilities , was released with the Xbox One platform starting in 2013 . The corresponding Kinect for Windows v2 hardware was released in 2014 , along with a supporting SDK . The 2.0 version of the Windows SDK supported the Kinect for Windows v2 as well as the Kinect for Xbox One hardware .",
  "/wiki/Xbox_360": "The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft . As the successor to the original Xbox , it is the second console in the Xbox series . It competed with Sony 's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12 , 2005 , with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo . The Xbox 360 features an online service , Xbox Live , which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console 's lifetime . Available in free and subscription-based varieties , Xbox Live allows users to : play games online ; download games ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) and game demos ; purchase and stream music , television programs , and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals ; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications . In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs . Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera . The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment . Launched worldwide across 2005-2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called Red Ring of Death , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 .",

  "/wiki/TFLOPS": "In computing , floating point operations per second ( FLOPS , flops or flop/s ) is a measure of computer performance , useful in fields of scientific computations that require floating-point calculations . For such cases it is a more accurate measure than measuring instructions per second . The similar term FLOP is often used for floating-point operation , for example as a unit of counting floating-point operations carried out by an algorithm or computer hardware .",
