  "/wiki/Two-way_contract": "A two-way contract is a professional sports contract which stipulates that an athlete 's salary is dependent upon the league in which the athlete is assigned to play . This is opposed to a one-way contract that would pay the same salary regardless of where the athlete is assigned to play . Two-way contracts are common for professional ice hockey players who aspire to play in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Any hockey player entering the NHL for the first time will sign an entry-level , two-way contract with an NHL team stipulating that he will receive a higher salary if assigned to play with the NHL team , but will receive a lower salary if assigned to play for a team in the minor leagues such as the American Hockey League or the ECHL . Beginning in the 2017-18 season , the National Basketball Association added two-way contracts between NBA teams and their NBA G League affiliates . Unlike in the NHL , these contracts are not offered to every aspiring NBA player , but only to undrafted players whom a team would like to keep on retainer without having to sign to a full-time contract . Each NBA team can have up to two two-way contract players per season , and are typically considered to be 16th and 17th men on a roster . Excluding time spent before and after the G League 's season begins and ends , players on two-way contracts can spend up to 45 days in the NBA while spending the rest of the season in the G League . As of the 2017-18 season , players earn $ 75,000 while they are in the G League and roughly $ 204,000 if they spend the maximum 45 days on an NBA roster . The two-way contract system benefits young undrafted players who do not want to play professional basketball overseas , as well as those who believe an organizational investment in them is beneficial to their development . Some player agents are concerned about this system , because in exchange for guaranteed employment at a higher salary than a typical G League player , two-way players give up the freedom to be called up from the G League by any NBA team , possibly one with intent to sign the player to a 10-day contract , which could eventually lead to a full-time NBA roster spot sooner than with a two-way contract . In baseball , players can receive a split contract .",
