  "/wiki/Austin_Powers_movies": "Austin Powers is a series of American spy action comedy films : ( 1997 ) , ( 1999 ) and Austin Powers in Goldmember ( 2002 ) . The films were directed by Jay Roach ; produced , written by and starring Mike Myers as both the title character and Dr . Evil ; and distributed by New Line Cinema . The franchise parodies numerous films and characters , including James Bond and Jason King , and incorporates myriad other elements of popular culture as it follows a British spy 's quest to bring his nemesis down . The character represents an archetype of 1960s Swinging London , with his advocacy of free love , his use of obscure impressions and his clothing style . The films poke fun at the outrageous plots , rampant sexual innuendo , and two dimensional stock characters associated with 1960s spy films , as well as the clich\u00e9 of the ultra suave super spy . Contrary to the handsome , super smooth leading men of the James Bond genre , Austin Powers is not conventionally attractive ( he is especially known for his bad teeth ) , although female characters seem to find him irresistible . The general theme of the films is that the arch villain Dr . Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thwarted by Powers , and ( to a degree ) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s . In Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery , Austin and Dr . Evil are awakened after being cryogenically frozen for thirty years . Continuing to incorporate cultural elements of the 1960s and 1970s , Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember feature time travel as a plot device and deliberately overlook inconsistencies .",

  "/wiki/Second_Letter_(Plato)": "The Second Letter of Plato , also called Epistle II or Letter II , is an epistle that tradition has ascribed to Plato , though some scholars consider it a forgery . In the Stephanus pagination , it spans III . 310b-315a . The Second Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse in response to a supposed complaint he lodged against Plato and his associates that they were slandering him . The letter disclaims any responsibility for these slanders and further denies that Plato has even heard of them occurring . It then counsels Dionysius that a concern for his reputation after his death should incline him to repair his relationship with Plato , since the interactions of political men with the wise is a topic of constant discussion . From this subject , the letter turns to an enigmatic discussion of the First , in which Plato warns Dionysius to never write these doctrines down and to burn this letter upon committing its contents to memory . The Second Letter is the source of the oft-cited remark that no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist , but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 ) . R. G. Bury argues of the Second Letter that it is fairly certain that it is inauthentic , based primarily upon conflicts he sees between the general tone and Plato 's Seventh Letter . He considers it to be by the same author as the Sixth Letter .",
  "/wiki/Fourth_wall": "The fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible , imagined wall separates actors from the audience . While the audience can see through this wall , the convention assumes , the actors act as if they can not . From the 16th century onward , the rise of illusionism in staging practices , which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century , led to the development of the fourth wall concept . The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne behind a proscenium arch . When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage , in what is known as a box set , the fourth of them would run along the line ( technically called the proscenium ) dividing the room from the auditorium . The fourth wall , though , is a theatrical convention , rather than of set design . The actors ignore the audience , focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world , and remain absorbed in its fiction , in a state that the theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called public solitude ( the ability to behave as one would in private , despite , in actuality , being watched intently while so doing , or to be 'alone in public ' ) . In this way , the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set , or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space , or the actors ' distance from or proximity to the audience . [ citation needed ] Breaking the fourth wall is any instance in which this performance convention , having been adopted more generally in the drama , is violated . This can be done through either directly referring to the audience , the play as a play , or the characters ' fictionality . The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance . This act of drawing attention to a play 's performance conventions is metatheatrical .",
  "/wiki/Direct_address": "The vocative case ( abbreviated ) is used for a noun that identifies a person ( animal , object , etc . ) being addressed or occasionally for the determiners of that noun . A vocative expression is an expression of direct address by which the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence . For example , in the sentence I do n't know , John , John is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed , as opposed to the sentence I do n't know John in which John is the direct object of the verb know . Historically , the vocative case was an element of the Indo-European case system and existed in Latin , Sanskrit and Classical Greek . Many modern Indo-European languages ( English , Spanish , etc . ) have lost the vocative case , but others retain it , including the Baltic languages , some Celtic languages and most Slavic languages . Some linguists , such as Albert Thumb , argue that the vocative form is not a case but a special form of nouns not belonging to any case , as vocative expressions are not related syntactically to other words in sentences .",

It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or co-productions , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 , there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries .",

  "/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet": "Fabula ( ) and syuzhet ( ) are terms originating in Russian formalism and employed in narratology that describe narrative construction . Syuzhet is an emplotment of narrative and fabula is the chronological order of the events contained in the story . They were first used in this sense by Vladimir Propp and Viktor Shklovsky . For Shklovsky , the syuzhet ( plot ) is the fabula ( story ) defamiliarized . He coined and popularized the term defamiliarization or ostranenie , which literally means making strange , in his 1917 article Art as Technique . A story can be made unfamiliar by its reformulation into a plot with jarring twists , omissions , digressions , and postponement of important information . Shklovsky uses Lawrence Sternes Tristram Shandy as an example of a fabula that is defamiliarized . Temporal displacements , digressions , and causal disruptions ( e.g. , placing the effects before their causes ) impede the readers ability to reassemble the story , and thus what may appear as a familiar story ( the fabula ) is upended by unfamiliar plotting ( the syuzhet ) . The defamiliarized plot causes the reader to pay attention and to see the story in a new , unjaded way . The fabula is the raw material of a story , and syuzhet is the way a story is organized . Since Aristotle 's Poetics , narrative plots are supposed to have a beginning , middle and end . This is often achieved in film and novels via flashbacks or flashforwards .",

A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Bront\u00eb 's Jane Eyre ( 1847 ) , in which the title character is also the narrator telling her own story , I could not unlove him now , merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me . This device allows the audience to see the narrator 's mind 's eye view of the fictional universe , but it is limited to the narrator 's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs . In some stories , first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters , in order to try to deliver a larger point of view .

However , a similar concept is applied to historical process , in which multiple different perspectives are used to evaluate events . Educators have extended the concept and term to apply to techniques used to teach multiple disciplines , including social sciences , like economics and civics , and physical education . The idea of the use of multiple perspectives arouse because educators and scholars from the recent decades questioned the validity of one-sided historical narratives . Instead of focusing on a dominant group 's point of view , they suggested to employ multiperspectivity . This is because of the diversity and cultural pluralism , since many groups - women , the poor , ethnic minorities , etc . - have been ignored in traditional historical narratives . Disciplinary is another reason . Good historians must not just focus on one side of the story , instead they must look into different sources to know if the facts corroborate with each other and to produce more accurate interpretations .

The narrator may be an anonymous , non-personal , or stand-alone entity ; the author as a character ; or some other character appearing and participating within their own story , whether fictitious or factual . The narrator is considered a participant if they are a character within the story , and a non-participant if they merely relate the story to the audience without being involved in the plot . Usually , a non-participant narrator is either an implied character or a being or voice with varied degrees of omniscience . Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the various times , creating a story with a complex perspective . Narration encompasses who tells the story and how the story is told ( for example , by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration ) . In traditional literary narratives ( such as novels , short stories , and memoirs ) , narration is a required story element ; in other types of ( chiefly non-literary ) narratives , such as plays , television shows , video games , and films , narration is merely optional .",
  "/wiki/Robert_Altman": "Robert Bernard Altman ( /\u02c8\u0254\u02d0ltm\u0259n/ ; February 20 , 1925 - November 20 , 2006 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , and producer . A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era , Altman was considered a maverick in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic , unlike most Hollywood films . He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema . His style of filmmaking covered many genres , but usually with a subversive twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views . Altman developed a reputation for being anti-Hollywood and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style . However , actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise , thereby inspiring their own creativity . He preferred large ensemble casts for his films , and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors . This produced a more natural , more dynamic , and more complex experience for the viewer . He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen . Critic Pauline Kael , writing about his directing style , said that Altman could make film fireworks out of next to nothing . In 2006 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman 's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award . He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations .",

  "/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness": "In literary criticism , stream of consciousness is a narrative mode or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind of a narrator . The term was coined by Alexander Bain in 1855 in the first edition of The Senses and the Intellect , when he wrote , The concurrence of Sensations in one common stream of consciousness ( on the same cerebral highway ) enables those of different senses to be associated as readily as the sensations of the same sense ( p. 359 ) . But it is commonly credited to William James who used it in 1890 in his The Principles of Psychology . In 1918 , the novelist May Sinclair ( 1863-1946 ) first applied the term stream of consciousness , in a literary context , when discussing Dorothy Richardson 's ( 1873-1957 ) novels . Pointed Roofs ( 1915 ) , the first work in Richardson 's series of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled Pilgrimage , is the first complete stream-of-consciousness novel published in English . However , in 1934 , Richardson comments that Proust , James Joyce , Virginia Woolf & D.R . . were all using 'the new method ' , though very differently , simultaneously . There were , however , many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers .",

  "/wiki/Free_writing": "Free writing has traditionally been seen as a prewriting technique in academic environments , in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without worrying about rhetorical concerns or conventions and mechanics , sometimes working from a specific prompt provided by a teacher . While free writing often produces raw , or even unusable material , it can help writers overcome writing blocks and build confidence by allowing them to practice text-production phases of the writing process without fear of censure . Some writers even use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic , often as a preliminary to formal writing . Free writing is not the same as automatic writing . Unlike brainstorming where ideas are simply listed , in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind .",
  "/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called a demonstration and summation of the entire movement . According to Declan Kiberd , Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual Joyce Wars . The novel 's stream-of-consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose - replete with puns , parodies , and allusions - as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .",

  "/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire": "A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin . He began the first volume of the series , A Game of Thrones , in 1991 , and it was published in 1996 . Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series , A Dance with Dragons , was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write . He is currently writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter . A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel , to 31 characters by the fifth novel . Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .",
