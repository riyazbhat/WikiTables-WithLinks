  "/wiki/General_Telephone": "GTE Corporation , formerly General Telephone & Electronics Corporation ( 1955-1982 ) , was the largest independent telephone company in the United States during the days of the Bell System . The company operated from 1926 , with roots tracing further back than that , until 2000 , when it was acquired by Bell Atlantic ; the combined company took the name Verizon . The Wisconsin-based Associated Telephone Utilities Company was founded in 1926 ; it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression , and was reorganized as General Telephone in 1934 . In 1991 , it acquired the third largest independent , Continental Telephone ( ConTel ) . It owned Automatic Electric , a telephone equipment supplier similar in many ways to Western Electric , and Sylvania Lighting , the only non-communications-oriented company under GTE ownership . GTE provided local telephone service to many areas of the U.S. through operating companies , much as American Telephone & Telegraph provided local telephone service through its 22 Bell Operating Companies . The company acquired BBN Planet , one of the earliest Internet service providers , in 1997 . That division became known as GTE Internetworking , and was later spun off into the independent company Genuity ( a name recycled from another Internet company GTE acquired in 1997 ) to satisfy Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) requirements regarding the GTE-Bell Atlantic merger that created Verizon . GTE operated in Canada via large interests in subsidiary companies such as BC Tel and Quebec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone . When foreign ownership restrictions on telecommunications companies were introduced , GTE 's ownership was grandfathered . When BC Tel merged with Telus ( the name given the privatized Alberta Government Telephones ( AGT ) ) to create BCT.Telus , GTE 's Canadian subsidiaries were merged into the new parent , making it the second-largest telecommunications carrier in Canada . As such , GTE 's successor , Verizon Communications , was the only foreign telecommunications company with a greater than 20% interest in a Canadian carrier , until Verizon completely divested itself of its shares in 2004 .",
