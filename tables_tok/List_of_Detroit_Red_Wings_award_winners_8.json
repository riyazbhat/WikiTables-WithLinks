  "intro": "The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. They are members of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL) and are one of the Original Six teams of the league. The franchise and its members have won numerous team and individual awards and honors. The first team trophy acquired by the club was the Prince of Wales Trophy in 1934, at the time awarded to the champion of the American Division. Their most recent team trophy was the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in 2009, taken in honor of being the champions of the Western Conference. [a] The team has captured the Stanley Cup as league champion eleven times, most recently in 2008. Gordie Howe is the team's most decorated player, with six wins each of the Art Ross Trophy as regular season scoring leader and the Hart Memorial Trophy as regular season most valuable player (MVP), twenty-one selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars (the most in league history), twenty-two appearances in the All-Star Game, the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to the sport in the United States, and the NHL Lifetime Achievement Award for long term contributions to hockey. Nicklas Lidstrom has the most awards of any defenseman, having once won the Conn Smythe Trophy as post season MVP to go along with having won the James Norris Memorial Trophy (Norris Trophy) seven times as the best defenseman in the league as well as twelve selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars and twelve selections to the All-Star Game. Terry Sawchuk leads goaltenders with three wins of the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender, seven selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars, seven selections to the All-Star Game, the Lester Patrick Trophy, and the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's best rookie. Howe, Lidstrom, and Sawchuk have all had their uniform number retired by the team and have all been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Three Red Wings have been the inaugural recipient of an award and three awards are named in honor of former Red Wings. In 1932 Carl Voss was named the first winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy."
