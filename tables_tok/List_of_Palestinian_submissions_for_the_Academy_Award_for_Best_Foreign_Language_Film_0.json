  "intro": "Palestine, as represented by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture has submitted films for consideration for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 2003. The Palestinians had also attempted to submit a film in 2002. The Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The award was created for the 1956 Academy Awards, succeeding the non-competitive Honorary Academy Awards which were presented between 1947 and 1955 to the best foreign language films released in the United States. As of 2019[update], Palestine has submitted twelve films to the Foreign Oscar competition and received two Oscar nominations. One for Paradise Now in early 2006, and one for Omar in 2013. Palestine is one of nine Arab countries to participate in the competition over the years."
