There were 11 outlets by mid-1974 , but by September 1974 many outlets had closed . The remaining 4 outlets were closed in February 1975 . KFC misjudged the local market and failed to develop a suitable business model , with its takeout only stores failing to catch on . Chickens imported from China were fed fishmeal , which ruined the taste . The chain was reintroduced by Swire Group in September 1985 , with an outlet opened on Jordan Road , at a cost of $ 3 million . A second outlet was opened on Causeway Bay in 1986 . By 1995 there were 17 outlets . Sold to Birdland in 1997 . 163 outlets",
