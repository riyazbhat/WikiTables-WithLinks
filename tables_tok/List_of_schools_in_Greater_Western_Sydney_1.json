An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within its defined school boundaries , some schools are either specialist in a given key learning area , or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance",
