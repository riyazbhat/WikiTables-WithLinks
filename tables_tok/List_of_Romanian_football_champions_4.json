  "intro": "The Romanian football champions (Romanian: campionii Rom\u00e2niei la fotbal) are the winners of Liga I, Romania's premier annual association football league competition. The title has been contested since 1909 in varying forms of competition. Steaua Bucure\u0219ti has won a record 26 championship titles, thus making it the most prolific team in the Liga I. The second most successful team in the league is Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti with 18 championship titles. The Steaua-Dinamo rivalry, also known as the Eternal Derby, is the biggest one in the Romanian football championship, and between the two teams, they have won the championship 44 times and finished as runners-up another 36 times during the 100 completed seasons. The third most prolific team was Venus Bucure\u0219ti which won all of its titles during the early editions of the championship, winning eight trophies before its dissolution in 1949. Since the first edition in 1909-10, the league has been won by 23 teams representing 12 cities, with nearly two-thirds of all editions (59 titles) being won by teams from the capital, Bucharest. The 2007-08 champions CFR Cluj were the first team outside Bucharest to win the championship in 16 years. The first Romanian Football Championship was held between December 1909 and January 1910 and included three teams, two from Bucharest and one from Ploie\u0219ti. The title was decided using a knock-out format, with Olympia Bucure\u0219ti being the inaugural winners. The knock-out format was used until the 1921-22 season, when a league consisting of seven teams was formed. The regular regional leagues season was followed by a final tournament featuring the first placed teams of each region."
