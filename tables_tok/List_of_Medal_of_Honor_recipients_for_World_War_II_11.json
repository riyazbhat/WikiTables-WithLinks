Volunteering to act as a scout , armed with only a rifle , he charged headlong into withering fire , killing 2 Germans and wounding 3 in order to capture a machinegun . Carrying this enemy weapon across an open field through heavy fire , he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests ; he then circled behind 4 other Germans , killing them with a burst as they were firing on his company . Spotting another dangerous enemy position to this right , he knelt with the machinegun in his arms and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 3 . The enemy now poured increased mortar and artillery fire on the company 's newly won position . Pfc . Magrath fearlessly volunteered again to brave the shelling in order to collect a report of casualties . Heroically carrying out this task , he made the supreme sacrifice -- a climax to the valor and courage that are in keeping with highest traditions of the military service",

His citation reads as follows : Mann boldly crept to within rocket-launcher range of an enemy artillery position and , in the face of heavy enemy fire , destroyed an 88-mm gun and an ammunition dump . Completely disregarding the great danger involved , he remained in his exposed position , and , with his M1 rifle , killed the enemy one by one until he was wounded four times . Taken to a covered position , he insisted on returning to a forward position to stand guard during the night . On the following morning the enemy launched a concerted attack and advanced to within a few yards of the position , throwing hand grenades as they approached . One of these landed within a few feet of Pfc . Mann . Unable to raise his arms , which were bandaged to his body , he yelled Grenade and threw his body over the grenade , and as it exploded , died . His outstanding gallantry above and beyond the call of duty and his magnificent conduct were an everlasting inspiration to his comrades for whom he gave his life",

  "intro": "This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941."
