  "intro": "Australian rules football in Queensland has a history which dates back to the mid-1860s. By the early 1880s it was the most prominent football code in the colony, but was progressively overtaken by the Rugby code, resulting in the local game disbanding in the early 1890s. The sport was revived in the early 1900s and continued to be played throughout the twentieth century, despite the majority of the state being considered for much of the century to be well behind the Barassi Line (the notional line dividing Australia into Australian rules and Rugby 'territories'). Australian rules football's continued surge in popularity in south east Queensland is most likely due to the continued success of the Brisbane Lions in the national Australian Football League (AFL) competition, combined with the AFL's financial support for the local game. That support saw the introduction of a second AFL club in Queensland, the Gold Coast Suns in 2011. [citation needed]\n In Queensland, the sport is typically referred to as AFL, or less frequently Australian Football, Aussie Rules or Australian Rules."
