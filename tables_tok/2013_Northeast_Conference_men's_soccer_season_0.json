  "intro": "The 2013 Northeast Conference men's soccer season was the 33rd season of men's varsity soccer in the conference. The Quinnipiac Bobcats are the defending regular season champions, while the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights are the defending tournament champions. Quinnipiac will be unable to defend their NEC regular season title, since they are moving to the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference for 2013. Central Connecticut won the Regular Season Championship by going 6-1-0 in conference play and will host the NEC Tournament in New Britain, Connecticut. St. Francis Brooklyn won the 2013 NEC Tournament Championship with the 4th seed by beating Central Connecticut (2-0) then Bryant (3-2)."
