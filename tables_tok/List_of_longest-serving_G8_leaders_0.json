  "uid": "List_of_longest-serving_G8_leaders_0",
  "intro": "This is a list of the heads of government of the Group of Seven nations at each G6, G7, G8 summit since the organisation's inception in 1975. The Group consists of the 6-7-8 largest industrialized democracies, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Also in attendance is the President of the European Commission, who represents the European Union. The G7 holds an annual summit, which each nation's head of government attends. Each year the heads of government take turns assuming the presidency, whose job it is to set the agenda for and host the annual summit. The leader who has been in office the longest of the eight leaders is considered the Senior G7 leader; currently Angela Merkel since 2014, and previously from 2011 to 2012. While the current G7 consists of seven nations, it didn't always. The group was formed as the Group of Six, G6, including all of today's members minus Canada. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Canada joined in the second year of the group's existence, 1976, forming the Group of Seven, G7. Russia, as the successor nation to the USSR, joined the Group of Eight, G8, in 1997, following the collapse of its Communist predecessor, under the leadership of President Boris Yeltsin. As of 2020, Russia is currently suspended from the Group of 8."
