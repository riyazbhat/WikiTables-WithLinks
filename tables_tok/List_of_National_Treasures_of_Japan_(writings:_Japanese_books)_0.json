  "section_title": "Treasures -- Japanese literature",
  "section_text": "Waka ( `` Japanese poem '' ) or uta ( `` song '' ) is an important genre of Japanese literature . The term originated in the Heian period to distinguish Japanese-language poetry from kanshi , poetry written in Chinese by Japanese authors . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Waka began as an oral tradition , in tales , festivals and rituals , [ nb 4 ] and began to be written in the 7th century . [ 14 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] In the Asuka and Nara periods , `` waka '' included a number of poetic forms such as tanka ( `` short poems '' ) , ch\u014dka ( `` long poems '' ) , bussokusekika , sed\u014dka ( `` memorized poem '' ) and katauta ( `` poem fragment '' ) , but by the 10th century only the 31-syllable tanka survived . [ 35 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b , of the mid-8th century , is the primary record of early Japanese poetry and the first waka anthology . [ 16 ] [ 41 ] It contains the three main forms of poetry at time of compilation : 4,200 tanka , 260 ch\u014dka and 60 sed\u014dka ; dating from 759 backwards more than one century . [ nb 5 ] [ 20 ] [ 42 ] The early 9th century , however , was a period of direct imitation of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In the late 9th century , waka and the development of kana script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values , culminating in the compilation of the first imperial waka anthology , the Kokinsh\u016b , in 905 . [ 26 ] [ 45 ] It was followed in 951 by the Gosen Wakash\u016b ; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] The main poetic subjects were love and the four seasons ; the standards of vocabulary , grammar and style , established in the Kokinsh\u016b , dominated waka composition into the 19th century . [ 45 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] At the end of the Heian period , the aristocracy lost political and economical power to warrior clans , but retained the prestige as custodians of high culture and literature . [ 34 ] [ 58 ] Nostalgia for the Heian court past , considered then as classical Japanese past ( as opposed to Chinese past ) , created a renaissance in the arts and led to a blossoming of waka in the early Kamakura period . [ 34 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Poets of middle and lower rank , such as Fujiwara no Shunzei , Saigy\u014d H\u014dshi and Fujiwara no Teika , analyzed earlier works , wrote critical commentaries , and added new aesthetic values such as y\u016bgen to waka poetry . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Some of the best imperial anthologies and best poetic anthologies , such as Shunzei 's Korai f\u016bteish\u014d , were created in the early Kamakura period . [ 34 ] The audience was extended from the aristocracy to high ranking warriors and priests , who began to compose waka . [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] By the 14th century , linked verse or renga superseded waka poetry in importance . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] There are 29 National Treasures of 14 collections of waka and two works on waka style , compiled from between the 8th and the mid-13th century with most from the Heian period . The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu ( 945 ) and Korai f\u016bteish\u014d ( 1197 ) . The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies : Kokinsh\u016b ( 905 , ten treasures ) and Gosen Wakash\u016b ( 951 ) ; seven private anthologies : Man'y\u014dsh\u016b ( after 759 , three treasures ) , Shins\u014d Hish\u014d ( 1008 ) , Ny\u016bd\u014d Udaijin-sh\u016b ( before 1065 ) , Sanj\u016brokunin Kash\u016b ( ca . 1112 ) , Ruij\u016b Kosh\u016b ( before 1120 ) , Sh\u016bi Gus\u014d ( 1216 ) , My\u014de Sh\u014dnin Kash\u016b ( 1248 ) ; and five utaawase contents : including one imaginary content ( Kasen utaawase ) , the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls ( three treasures ) , Ruij\u016b utaawase , the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at Hirota Shrine and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds . The designated manuscripts of these works found in this list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods . [ 4 ]",
