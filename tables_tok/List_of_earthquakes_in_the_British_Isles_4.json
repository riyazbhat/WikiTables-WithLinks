The shock registered 4.7-4.8 on the Richter scale and lasted approximately 20 seconds . It was the largest earthquake to hit the UK since the 1990 Bishop 's Castle earthquake , but there were no injuries and only minor structural damage . The epicentre was located at the junction of High Arcal Road and Himley Road ( grid reference SO898913 ) in the district of South Staffordshire , just outside the boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley , approximately two miles west of Dudley Town Centre . The tremor was felt over an area of 260,000 square kilometres ( 100,387 sq mi ) , including Wales , Liverpool , Derby , Yorkshire , Wiltshire and London . The furthest felt reports came from Carlisle in the north , and Truro in the South .

  "intro": "The following is an extensive list of earthquakes that have been detected in Britain & Ireland. On average, several hundred earthquakes are detected by the British Geological Survey each year, but almost all are far too faint to be felt by humans. Those that are felt generally cause very little damage. Nonetheless, earthquakes have on occasion resulted in considerable damage, most notably in 1580 and 1884; Musson (2003) reports that there have been ten documented fatalities - six caused by falling masonry and four by building collapse. The causes of earthquakes in the UK are unclear, but may include regional compression caused by motion of the Earths tectonic plates, and uplift resulting from the melting of the ice sheets that covered many parts of Britain thousands of years ago. Medieval reports of earthquakes that damaged or destroyed newly built cathedrals may have been caused by catastrophic failure of overloaded masonry, particularly towers, rather than actual earthquakes."
