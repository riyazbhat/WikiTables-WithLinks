  "intro": "The Nobel Prize is an annual, international prize first awarded in 1901 for achievements in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. An associated prize in Economics has been awarded since 1969. As of 2019 Nobel Prizes had been awarded to 916 individuals, of whom 16 were black recipients. Black people have received awards in three of six award categories: twelve in Peace, three in Literature, and one in Economics. The first black recipient, American Ralph Bunche, was awarded the Peace Prize in 1950. The most recent, Abiy Ahmed, was awarded his Peace Prize in 2019. Two black laureates - Barack Obama and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf - were presidents of their countries (the United States and Liberia respectively) when they were awarded the prize, while Ahmed was Prime Minister of Ethiopia when he was announced as winner."
