  "intro": "Indian Canadians or Indo-Canadians are Canadians whose heritage belongs to any of the many ethnic groups of the Republic of India. Indian Canadians comprise a subgroup of South Asian Canadians, which is a further subgroup of Asian Canadians. The term East Indian is sometimes used to distinguish people of ancestral origin from India in order to avoid confusion with the First Nations of Canada. Statistics Canada specifically uses the term Asian Indian to refer to people who trace their origins from the modern day Republic of India. According to Statistics Canada, Indian Canadians are one of the fastest growing communities in Canada, making up the second largest non-European ethnic group in the country after Chinese Canadians. Behind several communities, Canada contains the world's tenth largest Indian diaspora. The largest group of Indian Canadians are those of Punjabi origin, accounting for nearly 50 percent of the Indo-Canadian population. The highest concentrations of Indian Canadians are found in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, followed by growing communities in Alberta and Quebec as well, with the majority of them being foreign-born."
