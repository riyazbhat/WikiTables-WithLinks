  "intro": "Marilyn Pauline Kim Novak (born February 13, 1933) is a retired American film and television actress. Novak began her film career in 1954 after signing with Columbia Pictures, starring in numerous movies, including Picnic (1955). She later starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and Pal Joey (1957). She is widely known for her performance as Madeline Elster/Judy Barton in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Vertigo (1958) with James Stewart. Novak enjoyed box-office success and starred opposite several prominent leading men of the era, including Fred MacMurray, William Holden, Frank Sinatra, Tyrone Power, Kirk Douglas, and Laurence Harvey. Although still only in her mid-30s, Novak withdrew from acting in 1966 and has only sporadically worked in films since. She appeared in The Mirror Crack'd (1980), and had a regular role on the primetime series Falcon Crest (1986-1987). After a disappointing experience during the filming of Liebestraum (1991), she permanently retired from acting, saying she had no desire to return. Her contributions to cinema have been honored with two Golden Globe Awards, an Honorary Golden Bear Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She works currently as a painter and visual artist."
