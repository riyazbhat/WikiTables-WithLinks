  "section_text": "This was the initial roll-out for digital television using the DVB-T system . The transmitter frequencies and power outputs were chosen not to interfere with the UHF TV channels , but to be received with the same aerial-group . The QAM constellations and number of carriers were changed around 2002 after the collapse of ITV Digital as the service was taken over by the Freeview consortium .",

The mast (with extension completed February 2008) plus the Main UHF (TV) antenna on top gives a height of 260.7 metres (869 ft). The average height above sea level is 392 metres for the television antennas. It is owned and operated by Arqiva. The mast sways 10 feet, or 4 meters, which is quite high for a mast this size."
