  "intro": "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 is a four-disc DVD box set collection of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes, it was released on October 21, 2008. Warner Home Video had announced that this will be the final release in the Golden Collection series. Succeeding the Golden Collection series would be the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection series on Blu-ray, which had its first release in November 2011. On July 3, 2012, a two-disc DVD version of Volume 1 of the Platinum Collection was released. Volume 6 is far less child-friendly than the other five volumes in the series. Like Volumes 3, 4, and 5, it has a warning before each disc about the shorts containing content that some viewers would not consider to be politically correct by today's standards (but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons), and as such, is intended for the adult collector. However, Volume 6's disclaimer states that it is not suitable for children, as opposed to Volumes 3-5 stating that they may not be suitable for children. This is due to that in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes (like in Volumes 3, 4, and 5) and references to sexism in Robert McKimson's Wild Wife, Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II, most of them containing depictions or references to Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo or to Nazis and Imperial Japan in general. While Volumes 4 and 5 each had a couple explicitly WWII themed cartoons (Plane Daffy and Scrap Happy Daffy, respectively), Volume 6 is notable for having an entire disc dedicated to the subject (Disc 2: Patriotic Pals), including several of its bonus cartoons. Volume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of Volume 5. However, the discs in this volume were not region-coded, making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set."
