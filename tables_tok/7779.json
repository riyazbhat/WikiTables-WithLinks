  "section_text": "Since 1946 , the Big Ten champion has had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl game . Michigan appeared in the first bowl game , the 1902 Rose Bowl . After that , the Big Ten did not allow their schools to participate in bowl games , until the agreement struck with the Pacific Coast Conference for the 1947 Rose Bowl . From 1946 through 1971 , the Big Ten did not allow the same team to represent the conference in consecutive years in the Rose Bowl with an exception made after the 1961 season in which Minnesota played in the 1962 Rose Bowl after playing in the 1961 Rose Bowl due to Ohio State declining the bid because of Ohio State faculty concerns about academics It was not until the 1975 season that the Big Ten allowed teams to play in bowl games other than the Rose Bowl . Michigan , which had been shut out of the postseason the previous three years , was the first beneficiary of the new rule when it played in the Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma . Due to the pre-1975 rules , Big Ten teams such as Michigan and Ohio State have lower numbers of all-time bowl appearances than powerhouse teams from the Big 12 Conference ( previously Big Eight and Southwest Conferences ) and Southeastern Conference , which always placed multiple teams in bowl games every year Starting in the 2014\u201315 season , a new slate of bowl game selections will include several new bowl games .
