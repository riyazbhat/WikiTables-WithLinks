        "Long since ruined and with only two flint walls ( the east and west , pictured ) standing , this was originally a plain rectangular church ( 48 by 16 feet ( 14.6 m \u00d7 4.9 m ) ) of approximately the late 13th century ( although Ian Nairn considered it could be a century older than that ) . The west end retains a gable and circular opening . The chapel may have belonged to either Reigate or Merton Priory",
