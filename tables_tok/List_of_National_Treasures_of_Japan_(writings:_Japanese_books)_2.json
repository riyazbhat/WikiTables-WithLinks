  "section_text": "The oldest known [ nb 16 ] Japanese [ nb 17 ] large-scale works are historical books ( Kojiki and Nihon Shoki ) or regional cultural and geographical records ( fudoki ) compiled on imperial order in the early 8th century . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] They were written with the aim of legitimizing the new centralized state under imperial rule by linking the origin of emperors to the Age of the Gods . [ 138 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] The oldest of these historical books is the Kojiki ( `` Record of ancient matters '' ) dating from 712 and composed by \u014c no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei . [ 9 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Written in ancient Japanese style using Chinese ideographs , it presents the mythological origin of Japan and historical events up to the year 628 . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Shortly after the completion of the Kojiki , the Nihon Shoki ( or Nihongi ) appeared in 720 , probably originating to an order by Emperor Tenmu in 681 . [ 140 ] [ 145 ] It is a much more detailed version of the Kojiki , dating events and providing alternative versions of myths ; it covers the time up to 697 . [ 144 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Compared to the Kojiki , it follows the model of Chinese dynastic histories more closely in style and language , using orthodox classical Chinese . [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Both of these works provide the historical and spiritual basis for shinto . [ 144 ] [ 150 ] In 713 , Empress Genmei ordered provincial governors to compile official reports on the history , geography and local folk customs . [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] These provincial gazetteers are known as fudoki ( lit . `` Records of wind and earth '' ) and provide valuable information about economic and ethnographic data , local culture and tales . [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Of more than 60 provincial records compiled in the early 8th century only five survived : one , the Izumo Fudoki ( 733 ) , in complete form and four , Bungo ( 730s ) , Harima ( circa 715 ) , Hitachi ( 714\u2013718 ) and Hizen ( 730s ) as fragments . [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 154 ] The Nihon Shoki is the first official history of Japan and the first of a set of six national histories ( Rikkokushi ) compiled over a 200-year period on Chinese models . [ 145 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Based on these six histories , Sugawara no Michizane arranged historical events chronologically and thematically in the Ruij\u016b Kokushi which was completed in 892 . [ 157 ] [ 158 ] With the cessation of official missions to China and a general trend of turning away from Chinese-derived institutions and behavioral patterns in the latter part of the 9th century , the compilation of such national histories patterned on formal Chinese dynastic histories was abandoned . [ 159 ] With the development of kana script , new styles of uniquely Japanese literature such as the monogatari appeared around that time . [ 159 ] The newer style of historic writing that emerged during the Fujiwara regency , at the turning point of ancient imperial rule and the classical era , was called historic tale ( rekishi monogatari ) and became influenced by the fictional tale , especially by the Tale of Genji , with which it shared the scene-by-scene construction as fundamental difference to earlier historic writings . [ nb 18 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] [ 161 ] The oldest historical tale is the Eiga Monogatari ( `` A Tale of Flowering Fortunes '' ) , giving a eulogistic chronological account of the Fujiwara from 946 to 1027 , focusing particularly on Fujiwara no Michinaga . [ 162 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] It was largely [ nb 19 ] written by Akazome Emon , probably shortly after the death of Michinaga in 1027 . [ 161 ] [ 165 ]",
