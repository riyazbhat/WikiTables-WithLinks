This body is a group of 25 individuals ( currently 23 men and two women ) who govern the Communist Party of China ( CCP ) . Theoretically , the Politburo is elected by the CCCPC ; however , in practice any new member of the Politburo is chosen by the current members . Politburo members hold positions in China 's national government and regional positions of power simultaneously thereby consolidating the CCP \u2019 s power In the case of key policy decisions , topics are addressed in the Politburo which then determines actions to be taken by the national and local government . The policy direction for the entire country rests in the hands of these 25 individuals who meet together once a month . Admission into the Politburo is extremely difficult . Tight control over the body is exercised by current members who vet potential members carefully to maintain the balance of power . Good political relationships within the Politburo are essential for admittance into the group . All members of the Politburo are elected for five year terms .
