The term Texas Aggie, which comes from Texas A&M's history as an agricultural school, refers to students and alumni of Texas A&M. The class year of each alumnus indicates the projected undergraduate degree award year designation, although the actual year may differ. At Texas A&M and within its student culture, the term former student is more commonly used than alumni."
