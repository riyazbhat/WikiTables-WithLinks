  "intro": "The NIFL Premiership, known as the Irish Premiership or Danske Bank Premiership for sponsorship purposes, and colloquially as the Irish League, is a professional association football league which operates as the highest division of the Northern Ireland Football League - the national league in Northern Ireland. It was formerly called the IFA Premiership until 2013. Still known in popular parlance simply as the Irish League or the Irish Premiership, the Premiership was established in 2008 under the auspices of the Irish Football Association before the Northern Ireland Football League was created for the start of the 2013-14 season. At the end of the season, the champion club is presented with the Gibson Cup. Linfield are the current champions, lifting the league title for a record 53rd time. The title win was confirmed on 13 April 2019, following a 0-0 draw at home against the outgoing champions, Crusaders, which left them 12 points clear with three games remaining."
