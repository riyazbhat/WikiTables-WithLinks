  "intro": "This list of Brigham Young University alumni includes notable graduates, non-graduate former students, and current students of Brigham Young University (BYU), a private, coeducational research university owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) located in Provo, Utah, United States. It is the oldest existing institution within the LDS Church Educational System, is America's largest religious university, and has the second-largest private university enrollment in the United States. Approximately 98% of the 34,000 students at BYU are Mormon; two-thirds of its American students come from outside the state of Utah. In addition to its undergraduate program, BYU offers graduate degrees in 47 departments and includes two professional schools: the Marriott School of Management and the J. Reuben Clark Law School. BYU has approximately 370,000 living alumni. Over 26 BYU graduates have served in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, such as former Dean of the U.S. Senate Reed Smoot (class of 1876). Cabinet members of American presidents include former United States Secretary of Agriculture to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ezra Taft Benson '26 and Rex E. Lee '60, who was U.S. Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan. Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts and 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was valedictorian of his class in 1971. [citation needed]\n BYU alumni in academia include former Dean of the Harvard Business School Kim B. Clark, current Vice President of Yale, Scott Strobel '87, and Michael K. Young '73, President of Texas A&M University and former President of the University of Washington. The University also graduated Nobel Prize winner Paul D. Boyer, as well as Philo Farnsworth (inventor of the electronic television) and Harvey Fletcher (inventor of the hearing aid). Seven of BYU's twelve presidents were alumni of the University."
