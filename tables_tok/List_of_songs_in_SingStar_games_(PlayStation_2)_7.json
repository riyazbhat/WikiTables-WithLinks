  "intro": "The following is a list of SingStar games released for the PlayStation 2 video game console. The tables list the songs available in each game, with the country of availability indicated by two-letter country codes. For games that were localised for multiple markets, songs are either indicated as present (Yes) or absent (No) in the track list for each region. The first game in the series, SingStar, was released in Europe and Oceania in 2004. As of 2008[update], over twenty games in the SingStar series have been released in English-speaking territories, including a small number in North America. Most SingStar games are loosely based upon musical genres, such as rock or pop music (SingStar Rocks! and SingStar Pop respectively). Artist-specific SingStar games have been released, featuring artists such as ABBA, Queen, Take That, Die Toten Hosen, Kent and Mecano."
