        "A 119,005 m ( 1,280,960 sq ft ) habitat of Chinese juniper on Daepunggam , a cliff near the village of Taeha-ri , Ulleung-do . Although once plentiful to this area , the species is now found only above the cliffs where the strong sea winds have prevented the trees from growing to their full height . The difficult terrain ensures that the trees grow in isolation from other species , while protecting them from human encroachment . An early description of the habitat is found in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty after a patrol of soldiers was forced ashore by a storm in 1724",

Although common to Japan , in South Korea these species are found only on Ulleung-do . The beeches can grow up to 20 m ( 66 ft ) in height , while the hemlocks and white pines can reach 30 m ( 98 ft ) . The rarity of the species makes them valuable for research , the pine in particular having only a very narrow distribution on the island",
