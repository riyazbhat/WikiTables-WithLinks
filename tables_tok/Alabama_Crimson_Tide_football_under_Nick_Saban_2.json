  "intro": "Alabama Crimson Tide football under Nick Saban covers the history of the Alabama Crimson Tide football program since Nick Saban was hired as head coach in 2007. Alabama plays as part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and is a member of the West Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Tide plays its home games at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their overall official record under Saban is 152-23[a] (.869) (157-23 on the field), 17 bowl game appearances with twelve victories, seven SEC West titles, six SEC championships, and five national championships. Since 2008, Saban's teams have spent all or part of each season ranked No. 1 in national polls. On January 3, 2007, Nick Saban officially accepted the head coaching position with the Crimson Tide. In 2018, the team experienced many highs and lows, losing the National Championship to No. 2 Clemson. In 2008, Saban led them to their first undefeated regular season since 1994, but they lost the SEC Championship Game and the Sugar Bowl. In 2009, Saban led Alabama to a perfect 14-0 and their first BCS National Championship, and to their first overall national championship since 1992. After a relatively disappointing 10-3 2010 season, Saban led the Tide to back-to-back BCS National Championships in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons."
