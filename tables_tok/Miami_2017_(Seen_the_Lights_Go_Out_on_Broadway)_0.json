  "intro": "Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway) is a song written and originally recorded by Billy Joel which appeared as the final song on his album Turnstiles in 1976. Several live performances of the song have been released. He performed this song at benefit concerts: The Concert for New York City for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001, on the television program Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together for Hurricane Sandy victims in 2012 and during his set at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief. Joel has often tweaked the lyrics to the song at his live concerts, particularly at the Live at Shea and Coming Together concerts. On New Year's Eve, 2016, Joel performed at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida, a city just north of Miami Dade County. At midnight, he crooned the traditional Auld Lang Syne and then immediately went into Miami 2017. On the January 9, 2017 episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Billy Joel performed the song with Stay Human, the show's house band."
