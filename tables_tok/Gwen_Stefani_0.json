  "intro": "Gwen Ren\u00e9e Stefani (/st\u0259\u02c8f\u0251\u02d0ni/; born October 3, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. She is a co-founder and the lead vocalist of the band No Doubt, whose singles include Just a Girl, Spiderwebs, and Don't Speak, from their 1995 breakthrough studio album Tragic Kingdom, as well as Hey Baby and It's My Life from later albums. During the band's hiatus, Stefani embarked on a solo pop career in 2004 by releasing her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Inspired by pop music from the 1980s, the album was a critical and commercial success. It spawned six singles, including What You Waiting For?, Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl, and Cool. Hollaback Girl reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while also becoming the first US download to sell one million copies. In 2006, Stefani released her second studio album, The Sweet Escape. Among the singles were Wind It Up and The Sweet Escape, the latter of which was number three on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart of 2007. Her third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016), was her first solo album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart."
