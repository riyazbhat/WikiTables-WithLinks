        "In its prime , The Florida Brewing Company produced 80,000 barrels of beer annually , making it the leading exporter of beer to Cuba in the U.S. and the premier brewery on Florida 's West coast . The Florida Brewing Company survived the Prohibition and continued to thrive through the Great Depression . However , the embargo on Cuba and the opening of the Anheuser-Busch Company in Tampa ultimately led to its closing in 1961 . A cigar company later took over the building . It also served as a bomb shelter during the Cold War . The building was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair until it was restored in 1999 . It now serves as offices for the law firm of Swope , Rodante P.A",

Since 1902 , six of Florida 's tallest buildings have been in Jacksonville , five have been in Miami , two have been in Tampa , and one in Pensacola . [ 67 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Florida_1",
  "intro": "This list of tallest buildings in Florida ranks the tallest buildings (170 metres (560 ft) or higher) in the U.S. state of Florida by height. The tallest building in the state is the 85-story Panorama Tower, which rises 868 feet (265 m) in the City of Miami's Brickell neighborhood and was completed in 2017. Florida has 37 buildings that are 550 feet (170 m) or higher. The majority are located in the City of Miami, and over 94% are in the Greater Miami area while the rest are in the Tampa and Jacksonville areas. Of the 37 tallest buildings in Florida, 24 are in the City of Miami, 8 in Sunny Isles Beach, 2 are in Miami Beach, 2 are in Tampa, and 1 is in Jacksonville. The Greater Miami area accounts for 34 of the 37 tallest buildings over 550 feet in Florida. The majority of the skyscrapers in Miami are within the Greater Downtown Miami area, specifically the neighborhoods of the Central Business District (including the Downtown Miami Historic District), Arts & Entertainment District, Brickell, and Edgewater. Thomas Kramer is well known for the negotiations with local Miami-Dade County governments that allowed the building of the tallest towers in Miami. His influence is evident in the construction of high-rises in Miami Beach, particularly in the South Beach neighborhood of South of Fifth."
