  "intro": "The Kentucky Department of Corrections is a state agency of the Kentucky Justice & Public Safety Cabinet that operates state-owned adult correctional facilities, provides oversight for and sets standards for county jails. They also provide training, community based services, and oversees the state's Probation & Parole Division. The agency is headquartered in the Health Services Building in Frankfort. Since the beginning of the 2015 Fiscal Year, the department has seen a staffing shortage of epic proportions due to low salaries, constant overtime (currently nearing $10 million), and the lure of higher paying jobs in the private sector. What were once 8-hour days and 40-hour weeks with occasional overtime turned into 12-hour days and 60-hour weeks out of necessity. In response to this staffing crisis and continued pressure from correctional employees, the Kentucky Legislature held a special session and approved an immediate 13.1% salary increase for current security staff, moved non-security staff to 40 hour work weeks, and increased the starting salary for Correctional Officers from $23,346 to $30,000 annually. Shortly after taking office, Governor Bevin included $4.5 million in his biennial budget proposal to provide retention raises for correctional staff."
