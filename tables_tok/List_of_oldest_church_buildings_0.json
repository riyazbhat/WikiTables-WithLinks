        "According to tradition , the Apostle James , son of Zebedee spread Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula . In the year 44 he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat . The king Alfonso II of Asturias ordered the construction of a chapel in 810s in the place . This chapel was followed by a first church in 829 and later by a pre-Romanesque church on 899 , gradually becoming an important place of pilgrimage . In 997 this primitive church was reduced to ashes by Almanzor , commander of the army of the Caliphate of Cordoba . The construction of the current cathedral in the same place was built between 1075 and 1122 under the reign of Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile . The baroque fa\u00e7ade of Obradoiro was made in 1740 ; also baroque is that of Acibechar\u00eda ; that of Pratar\u00edas was built by Master Esteban in 1103 ; the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria , a primordial work of Romanesque sculpture , completed by Master Mateo in 1188",

Architecturally , it has a pentahedral apse and a cross-domed design with a narthex and a fore-apse space . It was once part of a large monastery and belonged in its southeastern part . The church 's exterior is decorated with blind arches and colourful ornaments : glazed rosettes , suns , rhombs and other painted figures . The church was built of stone alternated with three rows of bricks . It is 15.75 by 8.40 metres ( 51.7 ft \u00d7 27.6 ft ) in size . The church was the place where the anti- Byzantine Uprising of Asen and Peter was proclaimed in 1185 ; it was this uprising that led to the reestablishment of the Bulgarian Empire and the proclamation of Tarnovo for its capital",

Another building was added later to the west side of the church . The church interior was covered with mural painting probably in 1230 .

  "intro": "This article lists some but by no means all of the oldest known church buildings in the world. In most instances, buildings listed here were reconstructed numerous times and only fragments of the original buildings have survived. These surviving freestanding buildings were purposely constructed for use by congregations (or used at an early date). The dates are the approximate dates when they were first used by congregations for worship. Church may be used in the sense of Christian denomination or in the singular as the Christian Church as a whole. The church (ecclesia, assembly) is traced to Pentecost and the beginning of the Christian mission in the first century and was not used in reference to a building. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia the Cenacle (the site of the Last Supper) in Jerusalem was the first Christian church. Archaeology magazine suggests that the Dura-Europos church in Syria is the oldest surviving church building in the world. While Jordan's Aqaba Church is considered to be the world's first purpose-built church. Several authors have cited the Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Armenia's mother church) as the oldest cathedral. Also St. Thaddeus Monastery or Qara Kelisa (means black church) in Chaldoran County, Iran is noted by UNESCO World Heritage Centre as related to the 66 AD. According to Armenian tradition such a location was chosen because saint Thaddeus built the earliest church--parts of which are still believed to be in place as the base of the old section--upon the ruins of the temple."
