  "intro": "The 2011 Women's Premier League is the tenth season of the Scottish Women's Premier League, the highest division of Women's football in Scotland since its inception in 2002. A total of eleven teams are contesting the league. Celtic Reserves won the 2010 Scottish Women's First Division but were unable to be promoted as league rules stipulate each club may field only one team in the Premier League. Thus Hutchison Vale as second-place finishers were promoted and replaced the relegated Aberdeen. Dundee United Sports Club and Boroughmuir Thistle resigned from the league before the season commenced, resulting in Falkirk being offered promotion in February 2011. On the 17th matchday Glasgow City secured their fifth straight Scottish title. Owing to a lack of clubs eligible to be promoted, FC Kilmarnock Ladies were spared relegation and will compete in the Premier League in 2012."
