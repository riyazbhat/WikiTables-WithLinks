  "intro": "OLT Express Poland (ICOA: YAP) was a Polish charter airline, formally known as Yes Airways. On 31 July 2012 it suspended all charter services, less than a week after the scheduled sister airline OLT Express Regional cancelled all its services. Stranded customers were returned home on LOT services. All leased aircraft were repossessed by lessors, and even some wet lease pilots were released back to their employer airlines. Its sister airline, OLT Express Regional (ICOA: JEA), filed for bankruptcy on 27 July 2012 after its licence was suspended by the Polish Aviation Authority. Yes Airways was founded in 2009 and was based in Warsaw. It began operations in late April 2011. It flew from regional airports in Poland on behalf of tour operators, and was the first Polish airline to have Airbus aircraft in its fleet. In early 2012, YES Airlines was rebranded as OLT Express Poland by its new owners, Amber Gold, who also controlled OLT Express Germany and OLT Express Regional. The airline's main hub was located at Warsaw Chopin Airport. On 31 July 2012 OLT Express Poland followed its sister airline OLT Express Regional in suspending all services. All leased aircraft were returned to their owners."
