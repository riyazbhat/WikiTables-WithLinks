  "section_title": "New Year 's Day",
  "section_text": "The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January , and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform . However , even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar , they started the new year on different dates . The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August ( 30 August after an Alexandrian leap year ) . Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus , 23 September . The indiction caused the Byzantine year , which used the Julian calendar , to begin on 1 September ; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year . When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by Vladimir I of Kiev , the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496 , beginning on 1 March , six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number . In 1492 ( AM 7000 ) , Ivan III , according to church tradition , realigned the start of the year to 1 September , so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia , from 1 March to 31 August 1492 . [ 82 ] During the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name New Year 's Day ( or an equivalent name ) in all western European countries ( affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church ) , since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December ( in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each ) , just as the Romans had . However , most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December ( the Nativity of Jesus ) , 25 March ( the Incarnation of Jesus ) , or even Easter , as in France ( see the Liturgical year article for more details ) In Anglo-Saxon England , the year most commonly began on 25 December , which , as ( approximately ) the winter solstice , had marked the start of the year in pagan times , though 25 March ( the equinox ) is occasionally documented in the 11th century . Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September , the start of the so-called `` western indiction '' introduced by Bede . [ 83 ] These practices changed after the Norman conquest . From 1087 to 1155 the English year began on 1 January , and from 1155 to 1751 began on 25 March . [ 84 ] In 1752 it was moved back to 1 January . ( See Calendar ( New Style ) Act 1750 ) Even before 1752 , 1 January was sometimes treated as the start of the new year \u2013 for example by Pepys [ 85 ] \u2013 while the `` year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year '' . [ 86 ] To reduce misunderstandings on the date , it was not uncommon for a date between 1 January and 24 March to be written as `` 1661/62 '' . This was to explain to the reader that the year was 1661 counting from March and 1662 counting from January as the start of the year . [ 87 ] ( For more detail , see Dual dating ) Most western European countries shifted the first day of their numbered year to 1 January while they were still using the Julian calendar , before they adopted the Gregorian calendar , many during the 16th century . The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year . Eastern European countries , with populations showing allegiance to the Orthodox Church , began the year on 1 September from about 988 . The Rumi calendar used in the Ottoman Empire began the civil year on 1 March until 1918",
