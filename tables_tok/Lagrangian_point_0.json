        "Launched in 1978 , it was the first spacecraft to be put into orbit around a libration point , where it operated for four years in a halo orbit about the L 1 Sun-Earth point . After the original mission ended , it was commanded to leave L 1 in September 1982 in order to investigate comets and the Sun . Now in a heliocentric orbit , an unsuccessful attempt to return to halo orbit was made in 2014 when it made a flyby of the Earth-Moon system",
