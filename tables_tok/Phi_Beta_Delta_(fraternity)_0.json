  "intro": "Phi Beta Delta (\u03a6\u0392\u0394) was a college social fraternity in the United States founded at Columbia University, April 4, 1912. The Founders stated, Its purpose is to inculcate among its membership a fine spirit of loyalty, activity and scholarship toward their Alma Mater, to develop the highest ideals of conduct and to promote a close fraternal bond through means of carefully selected associates. Phi Beta Delta merged into Pi Lambda Phi on February 1, 1941. At the time, Pi Lambda Phi had 20 active chapters and Phi Beta Delta had 16, considering duplications, the combined post merger fraternity was a net of 33 chapters. All members and alumni of Phi Beta Delta were admitted into Pi Lambda Phi."
