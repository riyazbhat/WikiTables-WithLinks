For top local films gross, please view Cinema of Malaysia. Box Office - Yahoo! Malaysia and Cinema Online Malaysia are two current websites that show the ranking of films weekly inclusive of local films, but not providing any box office number. Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) also provide only the ranking of both local and international films weekly, based on the popularity at its own cinema. The ranking can be accessed at the right bottom corner of GSC's website."
