  "section_text": "The game disc features 45 songs chosen from the 12 original UK albums by the Beatles , the US album Magical Mystery Tour , the 2006 remix album Love and several non-album singles . [ 8 ] Though `` Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' and `` With a Little Help From My Friends '' are considered to be two songs , they can only be played back-to-back within the game . All songs except `` The End '' are playable immediately in Quickplay and other multiplayer modes , while in Career mode , players complete through the songs in a loosely historical order ; upon completion of the Career mode , `` The End '' , the mode 's final song , becomes available for all other game modes . Regardless of game mode , each song is played in a specific venue . Most venues are based on a historical progression of famous Beatles ' performances , including their first appearance on American television on The Ed Sullivan Show and their concert at Shea Stadium . For the Abbey Road venue , each song has a unique `` Dreamscape '' ; the songs start with the Beatles in the studio , then dissolve into the imaginative Dreamscape inspired by the song , finally arriving back at the studio at the end of the song . [ 9 ] The 45 songs included on the game disc are as follows , with the year the song was originally released , the album the song was published on and the game venue at which the song is performed : [ 10 ]",

  "intro": "The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts, in association with Apple Corps. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series and is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii consoles. The game allows one to six players to simulate the performance of songs by the Beatles by providing the players with peripherals modelled after musical instruments (a guitar peripheral for lead guitar and bass gameplay, a drum peripheral, and a microphone). The gameplay mechanics of the game are similar to those found in other Rock Band games, in which players use the instrument controllers to match scrolling on-screen notes in time to the music to score points. The 45-song selection of the Beatles' music on the game's disc was praised by critics, considering the list to be emotional, sentimental and a good cross-section of the band's catalogue. Compared to other music video games released previously, the number of tracks in The Beatles: Rock Band was considered small, and the inclusion of certain lesser-known songs, and the exclusion of more popular ones, was considered confusing. In addition to the on-disc songs, The Beatles: Rock Band features downloadable content, in the form of both singles and full albums (excluding those songs already on disc), allowing players to play through the album in a single session, once the album has been obtained."
