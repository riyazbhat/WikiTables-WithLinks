        "Abbeville is the capital of the Ponthieu region and lies some 20 kilometres from the sea . It is a town dominated by the cathedral-like St Wulframs Collegiate Church . At Abbeville is one of the major war memorials of the Somme region , this called Les Patrouillers ( the night patrol ) . The decision to erect a monument by subscription was taken in 1920 and in February 1920 the committee charged with supervising the erection of the monument organised an open competition to which 16 sculptors submitted maquettes including the Parisien sculptor Gauqui\u00e9 . In June 1921 the award for this prestigious war memorial was made to the Amiens sculptor Louis Henri Leclabart who had himself seen service with the 12\u00e8me R.I.T . The contract signed between Leclabart and the town was for a sum of 90,000 francs to cover the sculpture and engraving of the names of the dead . The monument was installed where Lesueurs Franco-Prussian war memorial had stood and was inaugurated on 3 June 1923 by Mar\u00e9chal Foch . There are some palms and laurel leaves in bronze on the pedestal , these dated 1927 . The pedestal is made from Euville stone and the sculptured group in Lavoux stone . At the Chauffour limestone quarry , near to Thiescourt in the Oise , are several remarkable carvings and two of these are by Leclabart . Between 1915 and 1917 this old quarry was used as quarters by the French army , including Leclabarts regiment . The Leclabart carvings are one of Joan of Arc and another called La fontaine",

        "Airaines ' memorial features a relief sculpted in 1922 by Albert-Dominique Roze . It shows a dying soldier and the vision that he sees when close to death . Airaines also includes Dreuil-Hamel once a separate commune but joined with Airaines by a decree of 26 September 1972 . The war memorial is situated in the Rue Aristide Briand near to the church and was constructed in 1922 . The decision to erect a war memorial was made in June 1919 and it was erected in 1922 by Grujon and Galland of Amiens based on the plans of the Amiens architect Lemaire . It was unveiled on 28 May 1922 . Albert-Dominique Roze ' composition in Lavoux Stone is a bas-relief called La Vision du soldat morant and was a fine response to the request to the sculptor that the monument would reflect la hauteur du sacrifice . Two plaques placed near the monument remember those who died in the Second World War . The final line of the famous Victor Hugo poem Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule is inscribed on the monument . Ceux qui pieusement sont morts pour la Patrie/Ont droit qu ' \u00e0 leur tombeau la foule vienne et prie/Entre les plus beaux noms leur nom est le plus beau/Toute gloire pr\u00e8s d'eux passe et tombe \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re/Et , comme ferait une m\u00e8re/ '' ' La voix d'un peuple entier les berce en leur tombeau .

However such feelings soon subsided and the citizens of Canchy are now most proud of their soldier . The soldier portrayed is a look-out man and sits in a trench . His rifle rests against his knee and at his feet are some spare grenades . On the monument the names of the great battles of the war are listed- Marne , Verdun , Somme , Yser .

In one particular monument , that at Chepy , there is some splendid work in mosaic thought to be by Gerard Ansart one of the Ansart Family . Marcel Sueur did the marble work . The monument was inaugurated on 21 May 1922 . At the bottom of the monument are the words worked in mosaic - SOYONS UNIS POUR VIVRE COMME ILS LE FURENT POUR MOURIR . The mosaic features a blue helmet on an oak branch and lists the major battles of the Great War . At the centre a sword wreathed with laurel runs through the names of the dead .

This is a statue of a soldier , the work entitled le poilu en plein combat d\u00e9fendant le drapeau . One would have taken this as being from the catalogue of Marbreries G\u00e9n\u00e9rales Gourdon but it seems that the marbrier Gaudier-Rembaux of Aulnoye presented himself in March 1922 to the neighbouring village of Beauchamps as the author of the Gamaches work so there is a little confusion",
