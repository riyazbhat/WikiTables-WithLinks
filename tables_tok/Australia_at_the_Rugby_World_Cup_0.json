  "section_text": "Australia won the right to host the World Cup in 2003 without the involvement of New Zealand after a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the New Zealand Rugby Football Union and Rugby World Cup Limited . The overall stadium capacity was reduced from the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales . The Adelaide Oval underwent a A $ 20 million redevelopment for the 2003 Rugby World Cup , financed entirely by the South Australian Cricket Association , with two new grandstands built adjacent to the Victor Richardson Gates . The Suncorp Stadium was a new A $ 280 million venue designed specifically for rugby , and was opened just before the start of the 2003 World Cup . The Central Coast Stadium was also a newly built venue , and opened in February 2000 at a cost of A $ 30 million . Aussie Stadium was one of two venues in Sydney that were used for football during the 2000 Olympic Games . The other venue in Sydney was the Telstra Stadium which was the centrepiece of the 2000 Olympic Games . Formerly known as Stadium Australia , Telstra Stadium was built at a cost of over A $ 600 million and was the biggest stadium used in the 2003 World Cup . The only stadium with a retractable roof used was the Telstra Dome in Melbourne .",
