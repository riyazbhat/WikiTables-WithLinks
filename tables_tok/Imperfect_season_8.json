  "section_text": "In the Rugby Football League Championship , teams initially played a variable number of games , with the maximum ranging over time from 26 to 38 , and some teams playing as few as fourteen . In more modern times the fixture list has been standardised at 26 games per team As a result of this fairly lengthy schedule , it has been almost impossible for British rugby league teams to lose all their games , with the only exception being during World War II 's so-called `` Wartime emergency League '' when teams were often able to arrange no more than ten games and some as few as five . The only four winless seasons since normal competition resumed after the war have been in the second and third divisions of the Championship In 2018 , West Wales Raiders set a number of Rugby League records for futility on course to losing all 26 games , including the largest point differential ( -1930 points ) , most points conceded ( 2106 ) and largest average number of points conceded per game ( 81 ) . In addition , they were on the receiving end of Rugby League 's largest ever defeat - a 144-0 loss to York City Knights",
