  "section_text": "As of 2017 German football champions have come from 11 of the 16 German states . The most successful state is Bavaria with 41 championships . Bavaria is also home to the two individually most successful clubs , Bayern Munich and 1 . FC N\u00fcrnberg . North-Rhine Westphalia follows with 25 championships . The state is home to the third and fourth most successful clubs , Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04 . No club from the Saarland , Thuringia , Saxony-Anhalt , Brandenburg , and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet won the championship In most cases the regional associations of the DFB align with state borders in Germany . However , the DFB has two regional associations in Rhineland-Palatinate , and three each in North-Rhine Westphalia and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg . For the champions of these states the regional associations are mentioned as well . From 1938\u201345 Austria was part of Germany , and Austrian clubs were thus allowed to compete in the German football championship . Rapid Wien won one championship in that period",
