  "intro": "Eurovision: You Decide is the most recent name of a BBC television programme that was broadcast annually to select the United Kingdom's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest. The show had previously gone under several other names, including Festival of British Popular Songs (1957), Eurovision Song Contest British Final (1959-1960), The Great British Song Contest (1996-1999), Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up (2004-2007), Eurovision: Your Decision (2008), and Eurovision: Your Country Needs You (2009-2010), but was known, for most of its history, as A Song for Europe (1961-1995, 2000-2003). The selection process, originally broadcast on BBC One, has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected. The most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would return and be called Eurovision: You Decide and broadcast on BBC Four. On 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that Eurovision: You Decide would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on BBC Two. The format returned in 2018 and 2019, again broadcast live on BBC Two. The national selection shows have been hosted by a variety of presenters over the years. Mel Giedroyc has hosted since its return in 2016, being joined by co-host M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w from 2018 onwards. The You Decide format was scrapped in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation, with BBC Studios and music company BMG collaborating in order to find the entry which will then be released and published by BMG."
