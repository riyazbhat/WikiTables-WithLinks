          "This reservation included Camp Apache , Camp Pequot , and Camp Cherokee . With the construction of the Mashantucket Pequot Casino in 1991 - 1992 , the camp 's surroundings had been changed enough that the Long Rivers Council decided to sell the property to the Native American tribe in 1992 .

The reservation was known almost exclusively as Camp Tadma until 2004 . Camp Tadma was closed in 2013 , much to the sorrow of the staff and dedicated Scout troops who had grown to love the camp . The camp was sold in 2014 and is now owned by a church"
