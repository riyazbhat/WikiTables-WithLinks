  "intro": "Art theft is usually for the purpose of resale or for ransom (sometimes called artnapping). Stolen art is sometimes used by criminals as collateral to secure loans. Only a small percentage of stolen art is recovered - estimates range from 5 to 10%. [citation needed] Some nations operate police squads to investigate art theft. Some famous art theft cases include the robbery of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911 by employee Vincenzo Peruggia. Another was The Scream when it was taken from the Munch Museum in 2002 and recovered in 2004. The largest-value art theft occurred at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, when 13 works were stolen in 1990 worth a combined $500 million. The case remains unsolved."
