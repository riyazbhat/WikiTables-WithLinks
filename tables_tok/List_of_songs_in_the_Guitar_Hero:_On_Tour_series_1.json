  "section_title": "Guitar Hero On Tour : Decades setlist",
  "section_text": "Decades 's setlist is considered `` a trek through time '' by IGN , featuring sets of five songs out of a total of twenty-eight tracks . Each set focuses on a specific era of rock music , including two called `` 2000s '' and `` Modern '' . [ 6 ] Each set has a specialized venue for the era . [ 6 ] Once all the songs in the set are completed , the player is presented with a final encore song for that set while also unlocking the next set . [ 6 ] Additional bonus tracks are unlocked for completing specific requirements in the game . [ 6 ] All songs are master recordings as opposed to cover versions used in the previous game . [ 7 ] The full setlist for the game is listed below . The setlists are different for the North American , [ 8 ] UK , [ 9 ] and European releases . [ 10 ] Seven songs in each are exclusive to the respective versions , and are listed as `` N/A '' when not available for that region 's release . [ 7 ] The Decades setlist was considered to be an improvement over the original On Tour , with more songs that would be `` much more appealing to fans '' of the console versions of Guitar Hero '' . [ 11 ] IGN felt that the setlist `` starts out bad but starts getting more enjoyable as you unlock the earlier decades '' . [ 12 ]",

  "intro": "The Guitar Hero: On Tour series is an expansion of the Guitar Hero series for the Nintendo DS portable console. The series is developed by Vicarious Visions and published by RedOctane and Activision. The game uses a Guitar Grip hardware unit that fits into the Game Boy Advance slot on the DS or DS Lite to recreate the experience of the console-based guitar controllers normally used with the game; this unit is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS due to the lack of the slot on the DSi hardware. The player uses fret buttons on the Grip while strumming using a stylus across the DS touchscreen to try to match notes as they scroll on the second screen in order to score points and complete each song. There are three titles in the series: Guitar Hero: On Tour, Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades, and Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits. Each game features a setlist with more than 25 songs, most based on master recordings. The games utilize the DS's local wireless features to allow two players to compete against each other. Players can compete using different versions of the games, allowing the songs of each game to be shared during play."
