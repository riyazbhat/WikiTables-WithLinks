  "section_text": "Unlike analogue television , The Wrekin had a sub-transmission site , also known as The Wrekin B , designed to serve the east of the region , to fill areas in which the main transmitter did n't broadcast into . This was necessary due to co-channel interference issues with Moel-y-Parc , on channels 42 , 45 and 49 ( see external links ) . After digital switchover , the frequencies serving the east of the region were removed for compromise frequencies that has better reception in all areas of the region .",

  "intro": "The Wrekin transmitting station is a telecommunications and broadcasting facility on The Wrekin, a hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It includes a 52 metres (171 ft) tall free-standing lattice tower with transmitting antennas attached at various heights. The DTT transmitting arrays add about another 10m to this. It broadcasts digital television, alongside digital and FM (analogue) radio. The station was first proposed in 1966. As The Wrekin is a local beauty spot, many objections had to be overcome and alternative sites analysed before planning consent was given. The transmitter opened in 1975. The building is semi-underground and the tower stands on its roof."
