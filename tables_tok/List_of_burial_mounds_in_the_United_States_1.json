Between the 2 excavations , three burial shafts with a total of fourteen burials and more than five hundred grave goods were discovered . The first shaft , found by Moore , was 11 feet in depth and 13 by 8 feet in width and height . The other two , found in the 1939 excavations , were 19 feet ( 5.8 m ) by 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) and 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) by 11 feet ( 3.4 m ) feet in dimensions . Grave goods found included flaked flint knives known as Gahagan blades , a matched pair of Long-nosed god maskette earrings of copper , Missouri flint clay statues , greenstone celts and spuds , and caches of beads and arrow heads . Many of the grave goods were exotic imports from such distant places from across the continent",
