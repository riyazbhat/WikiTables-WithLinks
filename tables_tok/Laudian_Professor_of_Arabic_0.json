        "Pococke started studying Arabic with William Bedwell in 1625 , and became chaplain to the Levant Company in Aleppo ( in modern-day Syria ) in 1630 to improve his knowledge further . He returned in 1636 at the request of William Laud , who had decided to make Pococke the first appointment to the chair . Thomas Greaves was Pococke 's deputy between 1637 and 1641 when Pococke travelled to Constantinople for research and to collect manuscripts . Pococke was appointed Regius Professor of Hebrew in 1648 , but his refusal to promise loyalty to the Commonwealth of England led to the parliamentary committee supervising the university to order his removal from both professorships . However , the committee was persuaded to stay the order until a replacement could be found , and it was never implemented . Pococke has been described as the finest European Arabist of his time ... and among the greatest of all time",

His interest in oriental languages came from his father , a rector in Shropshire . He is described in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a mediocre orientalist , who carried out little teaching despite having significant linguistic skills . He had a strong intellectual interest in oriental languages and peoples , although his inability to finish work meant that he published little .
