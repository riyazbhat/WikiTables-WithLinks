  "intro": "Russia participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In summary, the country's participants earned 15 medals: three gold, five silver, and seven bronze. The gold-medal tally of three was the worst ever result for Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union, whilst the total of 15 medals was the country's second lowest score since the 2002 Winter Games. This was seen as a national humiliation considering that Russia was to host the next Winter Games at Sochi. According to Dr Maxim Titorenko, a Russian psychoanalyst and anthropologist,the reasons for failures were to a large extent psychological. By receiving advance rewards [from the government] for something they were expected to do in future, the sportsmen lost all psychological incentive for further achievements. The comparatively poor result generated a chorus of criticism in Russia, and President Dmitry Medvedev demanded the resignation of Russian Olympic officials and ordered an audit. Corruption, as well as cronyism and apathy of Russian sports managers, was criticized. It was later learned that Russia's performance at the Olympics followed widespread misspending by sports officials and a dysfunctional bureaucracy, according to government auditors. Russia spent $186 million for the games, including preparations. The audit cited dozens of examples of money being wasted, saying the figure ran into millions of dollars. By contrast, Russia performed well at the Paralympics, also hosted in Vancouver, the following month."
