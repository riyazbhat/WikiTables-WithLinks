  "intro": "\u0112k\u0101da\u015b\u012b (Eleven), also spelled as \u0112k\u0101da\u015bi, is the eleventh lunar day (tithi) of each of the two lunar phases which occur in a Hindu calendar month - the Shukla Pak\u1e63a (the period of the brightening moon also known as the waxing phase) and the K\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a Pak\u1e63a (the period of the fading moon also known as the waning phase). [citation needed]\n In Hinduism and Jainism, Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is considered a spiritual day and is usually observed by partial fast. Beans and grains are not consumed by observant people during because they are believed to be contaminated by sin. Instead, only fruit, vegetables, and milk products are eaten. This period of abstinence starts from sunrise on the day of Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b to sunset on the following day. Rice is not eaten on Ekadashi. The timing of each Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is according to the position of the moon. The Hindu calendar marks progression from a full moon to a new moon as divided into fifteen equal arcs. Each arc measures one lunar day, called a tithi. The time it takes the moon to traverse a particular distance is the length of that lunar day. Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b refers to the 11th tithi, or lunar day. The eleventh tithi corresponds to a precise phase of the waxing and waning moon."
