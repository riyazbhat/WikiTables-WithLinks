  "intro": "The 2013 European Trophy was the fourth and final season of the European Trophy, an annually held European ice hockey tournament. It was also the eighth tournament since its predecessor, the Nordic Trophy, was launched in 2006. The regulation round began on 6 August 2013 with the South Division game between Pir\u00e1ti Chomutov-Sparta Praha, and ended on 8 September 2013. The playoffs were played between 19-22 December 2013 in Berlin. The preliminary schedule for the regulation round was released on 15 April 2013. JYP won the tournament, defeating F\u00e4rjestad BK in the final 2-1. Like last year's tournament, the same 32 teams participated in the tournament, marking the first time since 2007 that the teams remained the same from last year. For the first time in tournament history, Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin hosted the playoffs, the Red Bulls Salute. It marked the first time that the playoffs were hosted in a single city, as well as the first time that the playoffs weren't hosted in Austria."
