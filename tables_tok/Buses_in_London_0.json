  "section_title": "Operation -- Local buses",
  "section_text": "Main article : List of bus routes in London Most local buses within London form a network managed by London Buses , an arm of Transport for London . Services are operated by private sector companies under contract to London Buses . With the introduction of the London congestion charge in central London and because at peak times the Underground is operating at maximum capacity , many bus service improvements have been undertaken , and central bus services are currently enjoying something of a resurgence . [ 12 ] Although the rear-entrance double-deck AEC Routemaster is the archetypal London bus , their numbers have dwindled quite quickly owing to their age ( the oldest are now more than 60 years old ) , their inability to accept wheelchairs or pushchairs , and their requirement for a two-person crew . As described below , Routemasters are now restricted to one heritage route . [ 25 ] All other local bus services are now operated by modern low-floor buses , which may be single-deck or double-deck . Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors , and passengers board the bus using the front door and alight using the rear door , whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door . All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act , and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers Some local bus routes in the outer areas of London cross the London boundary . London Buses services that cross the boundary have standard red buses , and charge London fares , at least within the boundary . Buses from outside London that cross into London are in their operators ' own colour schemes , and may not accept the London fares even within the boundary A Metroline Alexander Dennis Enviro400 on route 139 . A London General Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated bus on route 521 operated by London General ( withdrawn in 2009 ) . The Red Arrow articulated bus fleet at Waterloo Bus Garage A London United bus bearing the logo of the RATP Group Because the operating contracts for local buses in London are subject to a system of competitive tender , a wide range of companies now operate bus routes across London . Many services have been contracted out to leading transport groups such as Abellio , Arriva , ComfortDelGro , Go-Ahead Group , RATP Group , Stagecoach and Transit Systems . Connex , FirstGroup , National Express and Transdev previously operated services in London . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Privately run bus services may also be operated independently of the regulated London bus network , but still require a permit from TfL . This permit applies to any service which has a stop in London and another within 15 miles of Greater London , such as commuter coaches , school buses or supermarket shuttle buses . [ 29 ]",
