  "intro": "SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (Hangul: SK\ud154\ub808\ucf64 or \uc5d0\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud154\ub808\ucf64) is a South Korean wireless telecommunications operator; it is part of the SK Group, one of the country's largest chaebols. SK Telecom is South Korea's largest wireless carrier: it leads the local market with 50.5 percent share as of 2008. Since its creation in 1984, the company has evolved from a first generation analog cellular system, to second generation CDMA, then to the world's first third-generation synchronized IMT-2000 cellular system. SK Telecom also became the world's first carrier to commercialize HSDPA in May 2006. SK expanded into the landline market by acquiring second-rated fixed-line operator Hanaro Telecom in February 2008. The company's online brands include Nate, a web portal; June, a mobile multimedia service; Moneta, an e-banking mobile app; Nate Drive, a telematics service and Digital Home, an online interface to remote-control household appliances. In 2004, SK Telecom launched Hanbyul, the world's first DMB satellite. TU Media, SK Telecom's digital media arm, handles DMB TV broadcasts. In November 2015 SK Telecom announced signing a deal to acquire CJ HelloVision, the country's largest cable and Internet operator, with the view to merge it with its own cable unit, SK Broadband. The acquisition, which will make SK Broadband the No. 2 paid cable broadcaster following KT, is being opposed by competitors, who charge that the merger will help SK unfairly dominate the market."
