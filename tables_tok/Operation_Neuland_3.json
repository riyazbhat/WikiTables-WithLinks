  "section_title": "Implementation -- U-161",
  "section_text": "The second patrol of U-161 was under the command of Albrecht Achilles . Achilles and his first watch officer Bender had both visited Trinidad while employed by Hamburg America Line before the war . U-161 entered Trinidad 's Gulf of Paria harbor at periscope depth during daylight through a deep , narrow passage or Boca . An electronic submarine detection system registered its passage at 0930 on 18 February 1942 , but the signal was dismissed as caused by a patrol boat . After spending the day resting on the bottom of the harbor , U-161 surfaced after dark to torpedo two anchored ships . U-161 then left the gulf with decks awash and running lights illuminated to resemble one of the harbor small craft ; and then moved off to the northwest before returning to sink a ship outside the Boca . After sunset on 10 March 1942 U-161 silently entered the shallow , narrow entrance of Castries harbor surfaced on electric motors to torpedo two freighters at dockside ; and then raced out under fire from machine guns . The two freighters had just arrived with supplies to construct the new US base ; and the harbor previously considered immune to submarine attack was later fitted with an anti-submarine net . U-161 started home on 11 March 1942 . [ 16 ]",
