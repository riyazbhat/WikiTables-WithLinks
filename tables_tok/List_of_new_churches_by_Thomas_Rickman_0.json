  "intro": "Thomas Rickman (1776-1841) was a self-taught English architect who practised in Liverpool and Birmingham. His major output consisted of new churches, most of which were in Gothic Revival style. He also restored and made additions and alterations to churches, and worked on other designs, including country houses, public buildings, schools, and banks. Rickman was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire.
