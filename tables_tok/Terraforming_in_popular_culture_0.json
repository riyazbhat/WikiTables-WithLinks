  "intro": "Terraforming is well represented in popular culture, usually in the form of science fiction. While many stories involving interstellar travel feature planets already suited to habitation by humans and supporting their own indigenous life, some authors prefer to address the unlikeliness of such a concept by instead detailing the means by which humans have converted inhospitable worlds to ones capable of supporting life through artificial means. Author Jack Williamson is credited with inventing and popularizing the term terraform. In July 1942, under the pseudonym Will Stewart, Williamson published a science fiction novella entitled Collision Orbit in Astounding Science-Fiction magazine. The series was later published as two novels, Seetee Shock (1949) and Seetee Ship (1951). American geographer Richard Cathcart successfully lobbied for formal recognition of the verb to terraform, and it was first included in the fourth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 1993."
