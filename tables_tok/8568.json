  "section_text": "Cage of Death 3PromotionCombat Zone Wrestling [ 3 ] DateDecember 15 , 2001 [ 3 ] CityPhiladelphia , Pennsylvania [ 3 ] VenueViking Hall [ 3 ] Attendance1500 Cage of Death 3 was the third annual Cage of Death event produced by the Combat Zone Wrestling professional wrestling promotion . It took place on December 15 , 2001 . At the CZW Arena in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The event was at the first time in the CZW Arena . [ 3 ] Due to their upcoming annual COD show at the end of 2001 , the company needed a bigger venue and made their debut in the ECW Arena , formerly Viking Hall and currently The Arena . The venue was the first sellout in the building since the era of ECW , and hundreds were turned away from the biggest show in the promotions history . [ 4 ] Ty Street wrestled Mongoose to a no-contest . Jeff Rocker ran in and then Nate Hatred and Nick Gage came out and destroyed everyone . Nick Gage and Nate Hatred defeated a masked team suspiciously looking like Jay and Mark Briscoe ( who wrestled under masks presumably to get around the selectively enforced Pennsylvania age restrictions ) . NWA Southwest workers Joey Corman defeated Samir and Brad Michaels in a 3-Way Dance . Corman pinned Michaels after hitting the spin doctor . In what had been billed as a match with Zandig and Glen Osbourne ; Osbourne , Lobo , and Danny Rose all got involved in a big brawl with Zandig until Greg from Tough Enough made the save . [ 3 ] In an elimination match , The S.A.T . defeated Chris Divine , Quiet Storm and Brian XL ( with Pastor Jim ) . The stipulation for the match was if Divine , Storm , and XL lose the match , Pastor Jim was out of CZW for good . The order of elimination : Joel Maximo ( by Divine ) , Divine ( by Jose Maximo ) , Jose Maximo ( by XL ) , Brian XL ( by Red ) , Quiet Storm ( by Amazing Red , after the Spanish Fly by the Maximos and the Infrared Splash ) . [ 3 ] Jon Dahmer and Fast Eddie Valentine defeated Chri $ Ca $ h & GQ . Trent Acid defeated Ruckus to win the CZW/BJW Junior Heavyweight Championship . Initially , both men were counted out , but the match was restarted by John Zandig with a ladder involved . Acid won the match with the Yakuza Kick , but was put through a table by Big Japan 's Winger , who then walked off with both belts . Johnny Kashmere defeated Menace with the Cradlebreaker . Mad Man Pondo defeated Z-Barr \u2013 The returning Pondo got the pin after hitting Barr with a splash on top of a chair and his patented Stop Sign . Adam Flash defeated Nick Berk and Nick Mondo in a Falls Count Anywhere match to win the CZW Iron Man Championship . [ 3 ] Inside the Cage of Death , were a jackhammer , a cactus , garbage cans , a truck hood , and tables ; and was topped by a scaffold . Justice Pain defeated Wifebeater to retain the CZW World Heavyweight Title as both men crashed through tables in the ring off of the scaffold that topped of the cage of death . [ 3 ] As the match finished , the Arena lights went out . In a kayfabe angle , former ECW owner Tod Gordon , along with The Blue Meanie , Pitbull # 1 , Rockin ' Rebel and Rocco Rock were in the ring , trashed CZW , with Gordon calling the fans `` ingrates '' for chanting CZW . After they abused Justice Pain and Wifebeater , the CZW locker room crashed the cage , and the lights went out again . When they came back on , The Sandman was standing in the middle of the ring . [ 3 ] Sandman then turned on his former ECW compatriots . At the end Sandman stripped off his ECW T-shirt for a CZW shirt and had a beer with John Zandig",
