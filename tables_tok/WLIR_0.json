  "section_text": "In 1991 , the station changed its moniker again , this time to `` The Cutting Edge of Rock '' . The explosion in popularity of grunge and alternative rock in the early 1990s led to a period of turmoil .

Alternative rock artists that formerly were played almost exclusively on the station were now being heard on many rock and pop music stations . [ 9 ] In 1992 , WDRE started simulcasting its programming with what was 103.9 WIBF-FM Jenkintown , Pennsylvania , which later became WDRE Jenkintown/Philadelphia .

  "intro": "WLIR (WLIR.FM) is an internet and over-the-air radio station (105.3 WPTY-HD3 Calverton-Roanoke, New York) that programs a new music/modern rock format that was originally heard on WLIR/WDRE (92.7 FM, 98.5 FM, and 107.1 FM) in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s along with the alternative rock of the 2000s to the present. The spirit of the original WLIR is maintained with the music mix and the personalities, such as Larry The Duck, Chris Sharpe, Drew Kenyon, Andre and Rob Rush. Bob Wilson, longtime WLIR employee and historian, created the WLIR.FM website and programs the music playlist."
