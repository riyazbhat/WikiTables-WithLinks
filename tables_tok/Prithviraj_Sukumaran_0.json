  "intro": "Prithviraj Sukumaran (born 16 October 1982) is an Indian film actor, director, producer, playback singer, and distributor known for his works primarily in the Malayalam cinema. He has also appeared in the Tamil, Hindi and Telugu language films. He has appeared in more than 100 films in a variety of roles, and has won several awards, including a National Film Awards, three Kerala State Film Awards, a Tamil Nadu State Film Awards and a Filmfare Awards South. The son of actors Sukumaran and Mallika, Prithviraj was first spotted by director Fazil. Fazil's screen test of Prithviraj prompted director Ranjith to cast him in the 2002 romantic-drama Nandanam, his acting debut, a commercial success. He established himself as a successful leading actor in the following years. In 2006, he starred in the coming-of-age romance film Classmates, which became the highest-grossing Malayalam film ever. In the same year, he won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performances in Vaasthavam, becoming the youngest recipient of the award at the age of 24. The 2009 action film Puthiya Mukham marked his debut as a playback singer, the film is considered significant in heightening his stardom. He won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor again in 2012 for the medical drama Ayalum Njanum Thammil and the biographical film Celluloid. In 2010, he began co-producing films for the production house August Cinema, starting with the historical film Urumi which he also starred in. In 2011, he co-produced and starred in the social drama Indian Rupee, for which he received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam and Kerala State Film Award for Best Film."
