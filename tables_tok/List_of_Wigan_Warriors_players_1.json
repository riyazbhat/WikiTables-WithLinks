  "intro": "Wigan Warriors is an English professional rugby league club based in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Formed in 1872, the club was a founding member of the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895, and competed in the inaugural season of the Northern Union's league championship. Since then, more than 1,100 players have appeared for the club's first team. Jim Sullivan has made the most career appearances for Wigan, having played 774 games between 1921 and 1946. Sullivan is also the club's all-time top goal scorer (2,317) and point scorer (4,883), and holds the club record for most points scored in a single match, with 44 against Flimby & Fothergill in 1925. The try scoring record is held by Billy Boston, who touched down 478 times for the club. Martin Offiah and Shaun Edwards share the record for most tries scored in one game, with Offiah scoring ten tries against Leeds in 1992 before Edwards repeated the feat against Swinton later that year."
