        "The name Gefn likely means she who gives ( prosperity or happiness ) and is generally considered connected to the goddess name Gefjon , but the etymology of the name Gefjon has been a matter of dispute . The root Gef- in Gef-jon is generally theorized as related to the root Gef- in the name Gef-n . The connection between the two names has resulted in etymological results of Gefjun meaning the giving one . The names Gefjun and Gefn are both related to the Alagabiae or Ollogabiae , Matron groups . Scholar Richard North theorizes that Old English geofon and Old Norse Gefjun and Freyja 's name Gefn may all descend from a common origin ; gabia a Germanic goddess connected with the sea , whose name means giving",

Freyja is cognate with , for example , Old Saxon fr\u016ba `` lady , mistress '' and Old High German frouwa ( compare modern German Frau `` lady '' ) . [ 1 ] The theonym Freyja is thus considered to have been an epithet in origin , replacing a personal name that is now unattested . [ 2 ] As a result , either the original name became entirely taboo or another process occurred in which the goddess is a duplicate or hypostasis of another known goddess ( see `` Relation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures '' below )",
