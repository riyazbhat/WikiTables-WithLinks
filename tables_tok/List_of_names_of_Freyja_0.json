        "The name Gefn likely means she who gives ( prosperity or happiness ) and is generally considered connected to the goddess name Gefjon , but the etymology of the name Gefjon has been a matter of dispute . The root Gef- in Gef-jon is generally theorized as related to the root Gef- in the name Gef-n . The connection between the two names has resulted in etymological results of Gefjun meaning the giving one . The names Gefjun and Gefn are both related to the Alagabiae or Ollogabiae , Matron groups . Scholar Richard North theorizes that Old English geofon and Old Norse Gefjun and Freyja 's name Gefn may all descend from a common origin ; gabia a Germanic goddess connected with the sea , whose name means giving",

  "section_text": "The name Freyja transparently means ( the ) 'lady ' and ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *fraw ( j ) \u014dn . Freyja is cognate with , for example , Old Saxon fr\u016ba `` lady , mistress '' and Old High German frouwa ( compare modern German Frau `` lady '' ) . [ 1 ] The theonym Freyja is thus considered to have been an epithet in origin , replacing a personal name that is now unattested . [ 2 ] As a result , either the original name became entirely taboo or another process occurred in which the goddess is a duplicate or hypostasis of another known goddess ( see `` Relation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures '' below ) .",

  "intro": "In Norse mythology, Freyja (/\u02c8fre\u026a\u0259/; Old Norse for (the) Lady) is a goddess associated with war, death, love, sex, beauty, fertility, gold, and sei\u00f0r. Freyja is the owner of the necklace Br\u00edsingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisv\u00edni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. By her husband \u00d3\u00f0r, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her brother Freyr, her father Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and her mother (Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja. Freyja rules over her heavenly field, F\u00f3lkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within F\u00f3lkvangr lies her hall, Sessr\u00famnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful j\u00f6tnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god \u00d3\u00f0r, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, H\u00f6rn, Mard\u00f6ll, S\u00fdr, Valfreyja, and Vanad\u00eds."
