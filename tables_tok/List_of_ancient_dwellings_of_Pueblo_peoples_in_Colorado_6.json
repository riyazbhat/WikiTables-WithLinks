        "Square Tower group is the largest collection of pueblo buildings at Hovenweep and was populated with up to 500 people . It is located in Little Ruin Canyon which is made up of Square Tower , Tower Point , and Twin Towers ruin groups . Towers at Hovenweep were built in a variety of shapes ; D-shapes , squares , ovals and circles and for several purposes , including tool and grinding work areas , kivas for ritual functions , residential rooms and storage . Towers have limited access , contain few windows and many have narrow slots or peepholes placed in the walls . The slots and doors of Hovenweep Castle , in Square Tower Group , have been shown to define an apparent solar calendar . The building is aligned so that light is channeled through openings into the building at sunset of the summer solstice , the winter solstice and the spring and fall equinox . The light falls in a predictable pattern on interior door lintels",
