        "Wilson trained as a surgeon and learnt Hindustani en route to India to work for the East India Company , where he studied Sanskrit and other languages . He published articles in the journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal , of which he was secretary for 21 years . Opposing compulsory Christian tuition for Indian students , he favoured traditional Indian education mixed with studies of the English language and Western learning , although he regarded Indian culture as inferior to that of the Western world . He arrived in Oxford in 1833 after his election in 1832 , but moved to London in 1836 to be librarian at East India House , the company 's headquarters , travelling back to Oxford as necessary to carry out his duties . He held both positions until his death in 1860",

        "Williams ( who became Sir Monier Monier-Williams in 1887 ) was born in India , the son of an army officer . Educated in England , he trained for the East India Company 's civil service at the company 's college , but news of the death of his brother in battle in India prompted him to return to Oxford and study Sanskrit with Wilson , winning the Boden scholarship . Graduating in 1844 , he was professor of Sanskrit , Persian and Hindustani at the company 's college until 1858 , when it closed after the Indian rebellion . As Boden professor , he wanted to create stronger links between India and England with the creation of a specialist institute at Oxford . His advocacy and fundraising at home and overseas led to the Indian Institute opening in 1884 ( completed 1896 ) , and he gave about 3,000 manuscripts and books to its library . He retired from teaching in 1887 ; Arthur Macdonell was appointed as his deputy in 1888 and in due course succeeded him",

  "intro": "The position of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford was established in 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, a retired soldier in the service of the East India Company. He wished the university to establish a Sanskrit professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in Sanskrit at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was hotly contested, as the rivals each claimed to be best at fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of Sanskrit scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the professor from graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford. Four of the first five professors were born in British India or had worked there. To date, Sir Monier Monier-Williams (professor 1860-99) has held the chair the longest, although a deputy was appointed to carry out his teaching duties for the last 11 years of his life. The current holder (as of 2015[update]), Christopher Minkowski, was appointed in 2005 and is the eighth Boden professor. His predecessor, Richard Gombrich, has said that he had to fight to ensure that he was replaced on retirement; his view was that Oxford retained the chair in Sanskrit because it was the last such position in the United Kingdom."
