  "intro": "Netflix is an American global Internet streaming-on-demand media provider that has distributed a number of original programs, including original series, specials (including stand-up comedy specials), miniseries and documentaries and films. Netflix's original productions also include continuations of canceled series from other networks, as well as licensing or co-producing content from international broadcasters for exclusive broadcast in other territories, which is also branded in those regions as Netflix original content. Netflix previously produced content through Red Envelope Entertainment. Netflix's first original content series was House of Cards, released in 2013 and the company has since increased its original content. All programming is in English unless stated otherwise, is organized by its primary genre or format and is sorted by premiere date."
