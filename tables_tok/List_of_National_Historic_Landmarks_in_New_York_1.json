There are 20 of these in New York State . The legislation establishing the National Historic Landmark program does not prevent these from being designated , [ 12 ] but in practice these are not often named NHLs per se , due to administrative costs of their nomination and to the low preservation value of designating them . [ 13 ] For the first 16 years of the National Historic Landmarks program , the National Park Service did not consider any sites already within the National Park system for NHL designation , and in fact if a NHL-designated site came into the NPS system it was de-designated .

[ 13 ] :105 The National Park Service identifies 18 historic sites within national park units in New York State , and lists these together with the NHLs in the state , [ 3 ] and there are also two National Historic Sites that are `` affiliated areas , '' receiving National Park Service support but not directly administered by it .

  "intro": "This is a list of National Historic Landmarks and comparable other historic sites designated by the U.S. government in the U.S. state of New York. The United States National Historic Landmark (NHL) program operates under the auspices of the National Park Service, and recognizes buildings, structures, objects, sites and districts of resources according to a list of criteria of national significance. There are 262 NHLs in New York state, which is more than 10 percent of all the NHLs nationwide, and the most of any state. The National Park Service also has listed 20 National Monuments, National Historic Sites, National Memorials, and other sites as being historic landmarks of national importance, of which 7 are also designated NHLs. All of these historic landmarks are covered in this list. There are 139 NHLs in upstate New York, 13 on Long Island, and 114 within New York City (NYC). Three counties have ten or more NHLs: New York County (Manhattan) has 86; Westchester County, just north of NYC, has 18; and Erie County in western New York has 10. Twelve other counties have five to nine NHLs, eight have three or four, 27 counties have one or two, and the remaining twelve of the state's 62 counties have none. The first New York NHLs were eight designated on October 9, 1960; the latest was designated on March 13, 2013. The NHLs and other landmarks outside NYC are listed below; the NHLs in NYC are in this companion article. Seven NHL sites are among the 20 National Park System historic areas in New York state. The other 13 National Park Service areas are also historic landmark sites of national importance, but are already protected by Federal ownership and administration, so NHL designation is unnecessary."
