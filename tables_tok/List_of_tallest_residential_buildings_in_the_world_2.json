  "intro": "The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) defines a residential building as one where 85 percent or more of its total floor area is dedicated to residential usage. The tallest residential skyscraper in the world is Central Park Tower in New York City, United States. It was topped out at a height of 1,550 feet (470 m) in 2019. Dubai is home to seven of the ten tallest residential skyscrapers in the world. High-rise residential buildings are spread throughout the city but most of them are concentrated in Dubai Marina. Dubai Marina is also known as the tallest block in the world because of the number of high-rise residential skyscrapers. The tallest planned residential skyscraper is 122 storey Pentominium, which will stand at 516 metres (1,693 ft) however the construction of this tower has been suspended since May 2011."
