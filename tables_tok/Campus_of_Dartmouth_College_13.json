  "intro": "Dartmouth College is located in the rural town of Hanover in the Upper Valley of the Connecticut River in the New England state of New Hampshire. Dartmouth's 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus centered on The Green makes the institution the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover, and its landholdings and facilities are valued at an estimated $419 million. Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from several early 19th century buildings to a number of ongoing construction projects. Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian style, a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions."
