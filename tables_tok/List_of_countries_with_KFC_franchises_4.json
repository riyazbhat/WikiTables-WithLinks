  "intro": "This is a list of countries with KFC franchises. As of year end 2018, there are KFC outlets in 142 countries and territories in the world. The first KFC franchise opened in the United States in 1952, and in Canada a year later. [citation needed] The first overseas franchise was established in the United Kingdom in 1965. [citation needed] A large number of Caribbean and developed Western markets entered by the early 1970s. This was followed by expansion throughout the Middle East and developed Asian markets from the mid-1970s and into the 1980s. China was entered in 1987. Expansions were made into most of Europe and South America in the early 1990s. The most recent area of expansion is Africa, where the company is targeting the continent's growing middle class. The major markets for KFC include China (4,563 units), the United States (4,020 units), Japan (1,181 units), the United Kingdom (900 units), South Africa (736 units), Malaysia (701 units), Canada (663 units), Australia (618 units), Russia (608 units), and Thailand (531 units). [citation needed]\n The global operations are overseen by Yum International, which is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. Yum!"
