  "section_text": "In July 2007 , it was confirmed by Ofcom that the television frequency assignment after digital switchover would be such that a wideband or group K aerial would be required for reception of all six multiplexes . However , the three public service multiplexes would still fall within the station 's original analogue frequency range assignment of aerial group A . [ 5 ] The digital switchover started at Bilsdale on 12 September 2012 and was one of the last transmitters in England to complete this operation on 26 September 2012 , the others being Pontop Pike and Chatton in the same region . [ 6 ] On 13 November 2019 , due to the 700MHz Clearence Programme , the following multiplexes moved frequencies : BBC A from UHF 26 to UHF 21 . Digital 3 & 4 from UHF 29 to UHF 24 . BBC B from UHF 23 to UHF 27 . Arqiva C and D moving to UHF 55 and UHF 56 respectively .",

  "intro": "The Bilsdale transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility, located at Bilsdale West Moor above Bilsdale, close to Helmsley, North Yorkshire, England. It includes a guyed steel tubular mast that is primarily used for radio and television transmission. The height of the mast is 314 metres (1,030 ft) to the pinnacle. It is among the most powerful in the UK, for analogue it was 500 kW ERP and is now 100kW / 50kW for digital. It has recently been equipped with new aircraft warning lights, in the form of arrays of ultra bright red LEDs."
