  "intro": "Iran competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 86 competitors, 82 men and 4 women, took part in 50 events in 9 sports. Moslem Eskandar-Filabi was the flagbearer for Iran in the opening ceremony. This would be the last Olympics Iran would take part in until the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, due to the Iranian Revolution two years later and the eventual outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War."
