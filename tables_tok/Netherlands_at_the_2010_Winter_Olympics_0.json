  "intro": "The Netherlands participated at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Dutch team consisted of 34 competitors and participated in bobsleigh, short track speed skating, snowboarding, and speed skating. The Dutch team won eight medals, of which four are gold medals. Seven medals were won in speed skating, one in snowboarding. The gold medal Nicolien Sauerbreij won on the women's parallel giant slalom was the first Dutch medal outside speed skating at the Winter Olympics since Sjoukje Dijkstra's medal for figure skating in 1964 and the 100th Dutch gold medal at the Olympics overall. This was also the first medal for the Netherlands at the Winter Olympics at a snow event."
