  "intro": "Zimbabwe participated for the first time at the Olympic Games under its current name in 1980, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then. Previously, it competed at the Games under the name Rhodesia in 1928, 1960 and 1964. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi marked Zimbabwe's first participation at the Winter Olympic Games, with Oskar Hauser, the Austrian born Zimbabwean, participating in the biathlon. Zimbabwean athletes have won a total of eight medals - three golds, four silvers and one bronze - in two sports. Seven medals were won by swimmer Kirsty Coventry in 2004 and 2008; the remaining medal was the result of a victory by the women's national field hockey team in 1980. The National Olympic Committee for Zimbabwe was created in 1934 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1980."
