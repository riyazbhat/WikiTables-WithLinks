[ 4 ] The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films . Following this , they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award .

With two exceptions ( 2001 's Inuktitut Atanarjuat and 2005 's Hindi Water ) , all submissions were Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois films . All of these were in French , except for A Bullet in the Head which was spoken entirely in an invented language . [ 10 ] Other French-language submissions have featured a substantial amount of Inuktitut ( The Necessities of Life ) , Lingala ( War Witch ) , Yiddish ( Felix and Meira ) , [ 11 ] and Mohawk and Algonquin ( Hochelaga , Land of Souls ) .

  "intro": "Canada has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1971. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. As of 2019[update], seven Canadian films have been nominated, including one winner, for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Of these films, three have been directed by Denys Arcand: Jesus of Montreal, nominated at the 62nd Academy Awards; The Decline of the American Empire, nominated at the 59th Academy Awards; and its sequel, The Barbarian Invasions, which was the winner at the 76th Academy Awards. Arcand's Days of Darkness was shortlisted for the Oscar, but was not nominated. The other four Canadian directors to have their films nominated are Deepa Mehta for Water at the 79th Academy Awards, Denis Villeneuve for Incendies at the 83rd Academy Awards, Philippe Falardeau for Monsieur Lazhar at the 84th Academy Awards, and Kim Nguyen for War Witch at the 85th Academy Awards. Of the 45 films selected to date as Canada's submission to the Academy Awards, 18 of them have also won the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture."
