Several days later , he single-handedly attacked and killed two groups of Japanese soldiers . On July 7 , Baker 's position came under attack by a large Japanese force . Although seriously wounded early in the attack , he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition . When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety , Baker insisted that he be left behind . At his request , his comrades left him propped against a tree and gave him a pistol , which had eight bullets remaining . When American forces retook the position , they found the pistol , now empty , and eight dead Japanese soldiers around Baker 's body"
