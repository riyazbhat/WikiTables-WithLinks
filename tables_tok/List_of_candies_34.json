By the mid-1980s , public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of the names . While initially sales were not affected , by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease . While the product 's name was changed to Diet Ayds ( 'Aydslim in Britain ) , it was eventually withdrawn from the market",

  "intro": "Candy, known also as sweets and confectionery, has a long history as a familiar food treat that is available in many varieties. Candy varieties are influenced by the size of the sugar crystals, aeration, sugar concentrations, colour and the types of sugar used. Simple sugar or sucrose is turned into candy by dissolving it in water, concentrating this solution through cooking and allowing the mass either to form a mutable solid or to recrystallize. Maple sugar candy has been made in this way for thousands of years, with concentration taking place from both freezing and heating. Other sugars, sugar substitutes, and corn syrup are also used. Jelly candies, such as gumdrops and gummies, use stabilizers including starch, pectin or gelatin. Another type of candy is cotton candy, which is made from spun sugar. In their Thanksgiving Address, Native peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy give special thanks to the Sugar Maple tree as the leader of all trees to recognize its gift of sugar when the People need it most. In traditional times, maple sugar candy reduced from sap was an important food source in the lean times of winter in North America."
