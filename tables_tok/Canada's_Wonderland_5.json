The two original roller coasters , Wilde Beast and Dragon Fyre uses pseudo-Elizabethan English spellings before reverting to modern spelling ( Wild Beast and Dragon Fire ) from 1998 to 2018 . Many of the original names of some the attractions have reverted to their pseudo-Elizabethan spelling , such as Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Wilde KnightMares , Viking 's Rage , and Canterbury Theatre . These renames occurred prior to the beginning of the 2019 season The stores , midway games and restaurants follow the medieval theme , as does the castle theatre ( Canterbury Theatre , renamed Paramount Theatre during Paramount 's ownership , and Wonderland Theatre until 2019 ) and a pirate show ( originally opened with the park as Sea Sceptre and later replaced with Kinet-X Dive Show ) in the middle of Arthur 's Baye . However , rides such as Drop Tower : Scream Zone and Speed City Raceway have no medieval theme Canterbury Theatre hosted ice shows from 2006 to 2011 and hosted Cirque Ambiente in the summer of 2012 and 2013 Entrance to the Leviathan , a giga coaster in the Medieval Faire",
