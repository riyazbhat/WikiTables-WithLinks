Designed by Joseph Stanislaus Hansom , it was founded on 26 October 1881 and opened on 16 August 1882 . Its tall west fa\u00e7ade faces a narrow road , and the building goes back a long way : the interior feels open and spacious , although there are side chapels . The five-bay nave was extended by W.C. Mangan in 1955-57 ; he also added transepts , a Lady chapel and other rooms . The Early English Gothic Revival church is mostly of yellow brick and stone . Some windows are in the more intricate Perpendicular style . It was listed in June 2015",
