The Hackett is recognized as the very first Great Lakes freighter , a vessel type that has dominated Great Lakes shipping for over 100 years . In 1905 , the Hackett caught fire and sank on Whaleback Shoal in Green Bay , 9.5 miles ( 15.3 km ) southeast of the Cedar River . The wreck slipped slightly off the reef , and currently sits in 10 -14 feet of water",
