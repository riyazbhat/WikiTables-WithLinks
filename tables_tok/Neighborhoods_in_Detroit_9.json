Originally a number of French ribbon farms , followed by farms and wooded estates , the area was annexed into the City of Detroit in 1885 which lead to the development of residential housing throughout . Significant architecture spans the years from approximately 1870 though 1930 , representing a variety of styles including Victorian Eclectic , Italianate , Romanesque , Tudor Revival , Beaux Arts , and American Four Square . Clark Park , named for John Pearson Clark who donated the land to the city for use as a public park , is located in Hubbard Farms",
