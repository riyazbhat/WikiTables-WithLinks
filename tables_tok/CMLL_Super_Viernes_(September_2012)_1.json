  "intro": "In September 2012 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held three CMLL Super Viernes shows, all of which took place in Arena M\u00e9xico on Friday nights. On Friday September 14, CMLL held their annual Anniversary Show, replacing the regular Super Viernes show. Some of the matches from Super Viernes are taped for CMLL's weekly shows that air in Mexico the week following the Super Viernes show. The shows features various professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portray either villains (referred to as rudos in Mexico) or fan favorites (technicos in Mexico) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Being professional wrestling events matches are not won legitimately; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public."
