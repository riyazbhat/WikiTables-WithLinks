  "intro": "The 27th Artistic Gymnastics World Championships were held in Paris, France, from April 14 to 19, 1992. The team and all-around events were not contested at the 1992 Worlds. The format was similar to that of the 2002 Worlds, with medals being awarded for the individual WAG and MAG apparatus. There were three rounds of competition: the preliminary round open to everyone; the semi-finals open to the top sixteen qualifiers; and the finals for the top nine gymnasts."
