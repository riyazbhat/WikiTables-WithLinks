Instead the salmon is buried in a dry marinade of salt , sugar , and dill , and cured for a few days . As the salmon cures , by the action of osmosis , the moisture turns the dry cure into a highly concentrated brine , which can be used as part of a sauce",

In modern times , the dishes are more often referred to as raw fish slices . Commonly used fish in ancient times include carp and mandarin fish , but salmon is also used in modern times . Sauces were an essential part of kuai dishes , with green onions used for preparation of sauces in spring and mustard seed used for sauces in autumn . According to many classical texts , kuai served without sauces was deemed inedible and should be avoided",
