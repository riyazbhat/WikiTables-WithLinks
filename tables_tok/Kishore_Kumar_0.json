  "intro": "Abhas Kumar Ganguly (born 4 August 1929 - 13 October 1987), better known by his stage name Kishore Kumar (pronunciation (help\u00b7info)) was an Indian playback singer, actor, music director, lyricist, writer, director, producer and screenwriter. He is considered as one of the most popular singers of Indian film industry and from soft numbers to peppy tracks to romantic moods, Kumar sang in different genres but some of his rare compositions which were considered classics were lost in time. According to Ashok Kumar, Kumar's success lies in the fact that his voice used to hit the microphone straight at its most sensitive point. Apart from Hindi, he sang in many Indian languages including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam and Urdu. He has also sung in private albums in several languages especially in Bengali. He won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in the year 1985-86. In the year 1997, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated an award called the Kishore Kumar Award as a contribution to Hindi cinema. Recently, Kishore Kumar's unreleased last song was sold for Rs 1560,000 (1.56 million) at the Osian's Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012."
