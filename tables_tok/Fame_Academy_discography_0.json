  "intro": "Fame Academy is a British television programme that ran for two series, in 2002 and 2004. The show was produced for the BBC in a reality television format. The winners of the show, David Sneddon and Alex Parks, were awarded music recording contracts to allow them to release music and live like top recording artists for a year. Sneddon had a run of three top-20 hits, including his debut single Stop Living the Lie, which peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart in January 2003. David Sneddon signed to major music publisher Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2009 as a songwriter. Parks' debut single Maybe That's What It Takes charted at number three in November 2003. In addition to Sneddon and Parks, several other contestants have gone on to have successful music careers, while others were given record deals and released several songs before leaving the music industry. [deprecated source] The runner-up from the first series, Sin\u00e9ad Quinn, signed a record deal with Mercury Records, the same company as Sneddon, and released her debut single I Can't Break Down in February 2003. The song charted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Her second single, What You Need Is. peaked in top 20 in June 2003. Ainslie Henderson's debut, and thus far only single Keep Me a Secret ranked number five in February 2003."
