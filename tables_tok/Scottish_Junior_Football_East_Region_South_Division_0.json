  "intro": "The Scottish Junior Football East Region Premier League South also known for sponsorship reasons as the McBookie.com East Premier League South, is the second-tier division of the East Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association and sits parallel with the East Region Premier League North. The league came into existence under the 'South' name for the 2006-07 season, although a 'Lothian District league' had been in place below the East Super League since 2002-03, using the structure of a common 'East Region' top tier amd lower regional divisions in place of the old structure of three separate regional leagues in that part of Scotland, with the East Junior Football League the historic Lothians competition. The South Division was expanded for the start of the 2013-14 season by absorbing the more southerly clubs from the dissolved East Region Central Division as part of league reconstruction in the region. Up until season 2017-18, there was a Premier League at tier 2 and North and South Divisions at tier 3. The large-scale movement of clubs to the East of Scotland League has resulted in the structure being flattened. Further league reconstruction for the 2019-20 season split the Super League into North and South divisions, reducing the number of Premier League South teams. It now comprises 10 clubs who each play each other home and away to give 27 league fixtures."
