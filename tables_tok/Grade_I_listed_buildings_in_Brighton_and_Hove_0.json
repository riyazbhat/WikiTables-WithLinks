  "intro": "There are 24 Grade I listed buildings in the city of Brighton and Hove, England. The city, on the English Channel coast approximately 52 miles (84 km) south of London, was formed as a unitary authority in 1997 by the merger of the neighbouring towns of Brighton and Hove. Queen Elizabeth II granted city status in 2000. In England, a building or structure is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status: Grade I, the highest, defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II*, particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, used for buildings of special interest. Brighton and its westerly neighbour Hove developed independently as fishing villages on the English Channel coastline. Brighton was founded as a Saxon homestead and had a population of about 400 at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086. Hove had a long tradition of farming on the fertile downland behind the coast, and was also known for smuggling activity. Both places were in decline in the mid-17th century; but local doctor Richard Russell's advocacy of drinking and bathing in seawater at Brighton attracted members of Britain's high society and royalty. This included the Prince of Wales, who commissioned architect John Nash to build a house; the result was the city's best-known building, the architecturally eclectic Royal Pavilion. Helped by its proximity to London, good climate and the royal patronage it enjoyed, Brighton developed rapidly in the early 19th century: the number of houses doubled to about 8,000 between 1820 and 1830."
