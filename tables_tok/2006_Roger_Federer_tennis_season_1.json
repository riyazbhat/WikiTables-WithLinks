  "intro": "Roger Federers 2006 season was dominant and he ended the year with a 92-5 record. The world No.1 reached all four Grand Slam finals in 2006, winning three of them. His only Grand Slam loss came against Rafael Nadal in the French Open final in four sets, 6-1, 1-6, 4-6, 6-7(4-7). This was the first time they had met in a Major final. In the other three Grand Slams of 2006, Federer defeated Nadal in the final of the Wimbledon Championships, 6-0, 7-6(7-5), 6-7(2-7), 6-3. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis, 5-7, 7-5, 6-0, 6-2, at the Australian Open and Andy Roddick, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, at the US Open. In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals (out of the seven events he entered), winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Also, Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo, three ATP 250 series events in Doha, Halle, and Basel, and captured the Year-End Championship for the third time in his career. In December 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as the second greatest open era season behind Rod Laver's Calendar Grand Slam year of 1969,1970."
