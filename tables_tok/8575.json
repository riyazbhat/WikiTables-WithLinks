  "section_text": "The Cage of Death was a double cage structure with a four-sided steel wired cage inside the large four-sided wooden cage , a roof made up of a barbed wire spider net , wooden boards , and a scaffold topping the traditional four-sided original Cage of Death . Surrounding the Cage that surrounded the Cage-enclosed ring was a platform surrounding that with tables , chairs , lemon juice , salt , ladders , sheets of auto glass and other different goodies enclosed by a large second four-sided wooden cage . In the middle of That platform was a vertical wall of glass which exploded after Devon Moore took a `` Mother F ' n Bomb '' through it . [ 12 ] Other sick spots saw Devon Moore doing a shooting star press onto all but Zandig , Sami Callihan hitting a senton off the scaffold/spidernet through a barbed wire table on Brain Damage , and Drake Younger Russian legsweeping Danny Havoc off the side of the cage through a barbed wire board propped up by chairs . [ 13 ] In the end , Zandig got to the top of the structure to win the match . After the match , Zandig stated that he was trying to prove that `` his boys '' had their Onita style `` fighting spirit '' back , and handed out the $ 10,000 to all five other competitors . [ 13 ]"
