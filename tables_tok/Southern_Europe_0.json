  "intro": "Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe,also known as Mediterranean Europe, include Italy, Malta, Greece, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, Spain, East Thrace of European Turkey and Cyprus. Also often included despite not having a coast in the Mediterranean are Portugal, Serbia, North Macedonia, Andorra, San Marino and Vatican City. Some definitions may also include Southern France (Corsica, Occitanie and Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur) and Monaco, which are otherwise considered parts of Western Europe, and Bulgaria, which is otherwise considered part of Eastern Europe. Different methods can be used to define Southern Europe, including its political, economic, and cultural attributes. Southern Europe can also be defined by its natural features - its geography, climate, and flora. Politically, seven of the Southern European states form the EU Med group."
