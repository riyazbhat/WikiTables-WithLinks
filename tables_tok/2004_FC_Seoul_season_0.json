  "intro": "It was the first season as renamed FC Seoul. Its manager was Cho Kwang-Rae. The capital's new club had a solid but highly unspectacular season. Players such as left midfielder/wing-back Kim Dong-jin and striker Kim Eun-jung flitted in and out of the national team just as Seoul flitted in and out of the title race. The team was very much in halfway during the second stage when it was top of the league but a poor run-in put paid to any play-off chances. It was the team's inability to score enough goals to turn a plethora of draws into wins that cost the capital the chance to welcome the championship. Only Bucheon, Busan and Gwangju scored less than Seoul's meagre twenty."
