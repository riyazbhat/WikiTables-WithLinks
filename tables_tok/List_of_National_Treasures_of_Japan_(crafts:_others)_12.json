  "section_text": "Armour has been employed in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period . Some of the oldest extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures . These ancient armours were of two types : a tight fitting solid plate cuirass ( tank\u014d ) and a skirted lamellar type ( keik\u014d ) , both believed to be based on Chinese or Korean prototypes . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] This list includes more recent pieces of armour , developed as result of a trend toward ( lamellar ) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period ( 9th to 10th centuries ) . [ 138 ] Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts , these armours had the advantage of being light , flexible , foldable and shock absorbent . They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century . [ 136 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A complete set consisted of a helmet , mask , neck guard , throat protector , breastplate with shoulder guards , sleeve armour , skirt , greaves , shoes and a pennant attached to the back . [ 141 ] [ 142 ] During this time , there were two popular kinds of armour : the \u014d-yoroi ( lit . `` great armour '' ) with a boxlike appearance , mainly worn by high-ranking samurai on horseback , and the lighter and more flexible d\u014d-maru that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] The \u014d-yoroi was made of leather and iron lames bound together in horizontal layers , ornamented and reinforced with leather , silk and gilt metal . [ 140 ] It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the Genpei War at the end of the 12th century . [ 146 ] Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour , it was also worn for ceremonies . [ 147 ] The tighter fitting d\u014d-maru , developed in the 11th century , was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a solid breastplate or sleeves . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal , leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords . [ 148 ] Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the \u014d-yoroi , upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300 , as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit . [ 143 ] [ 146 ] [ 149 ] Three d\u014d-maru , fifteen \u014d-yoroi armours and one pair of gauntlets have been designated as National Treasures . Most of the items include a helmet and large sleeve protectors . [ 4 ]",
