  "intro": "The Secretary General of the Council of Europe (French: Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil de l'Europe, German: Generalsekret\u00e4r des Europarates) is appointed by the Parliamentary Assembly on the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers for a period of five years. He or she is entrusted with the responsibility of meeting the aim for which the Council of Europe was set up in London on 5 May 1949, namely to achieve greater unity between its Member States for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress. Although the Secretary General's powers are not clearly defined, in practice the holder has overall responsibility for the strategic management of the Council of Europes work programme and budget and oversees the day-to-day running of the Organisation and Secretariat."
