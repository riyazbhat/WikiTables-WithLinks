  "intro": "In 1959, the British Lions rugby union team toured Australia and New Zealand. The Lions won the two test matches against Australia but lost the international series against the All Blacks by three matches to one. They also played two matches in Canada, on the return leg of the journey. Although New Zealand won the series, the results in three of the tests were close. The Lions scored four tries to nil in the first test but six penalties by Don Clarke saw the All Blacks win 18-17. Clarke also scored a late try and conversion to win the second test, 11-8. New Zealand won the third test comfortably by 22-8 to win the series but the fourth test, which the Lions won 9-6, could have gone the All Blacks way had Clarke not missed a late penalty attempt. Overall the tourists played thirty-three matches, winning twenty-seven and losing six. In Australia the Lions played six matches, winning five and losing one, to New South Wales. In New Zealand they played twenty-five matches, winning twenty and losing five - in addition to their three test defeats they also lost to Otago and Canterbury. They also played two matches in Canada, winning both. The tour was notable for the 842 points scored in 33 games, a record number of points for a Lions tour and for the 22 tries scored by Tony O'Reilly, also a Lions tour record."
