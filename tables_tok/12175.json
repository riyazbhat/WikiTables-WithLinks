  "section_text": "Transportable Ferris wheels are designed to be operated at multiple locations , as opposed to fixed wheels which are usually intended for permanent installation . Small transportable designs may be permanently mounted on trailers , and can be moved intact . Larger transportable wheels are designed to be repeatedly dismantled and rebuilt , some using water ballast instead of the permanent foundations of their fixed counterparts Fixed wheels are also sometimes dismantled and relocated . Larger examples include the original Ferris Wheel , which operated at two sites in Chicago , Illinois , and a third in St. Louis , Missouri ; Technocosmos/Technostar , which moved to Expoland , Osaka , after Expo '85 , Tsukuba , Ibaraki , for which it was built , ended ; and Cosmo Clock 21 , which added 5 metres ( 16 ft ) onto its original 107.5-metre ( 353 ft ) height when erected for the second time at Minato Mirai 21 , Yokohama , in 1999 The world 's tallest transportable wheel today [ update ] is the 78-metre ( 256 ft ) Bussink Design R80XL . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Roue de Paris , a Ronald Bussink R60 transportable wheel , at Geleen in the Netherlands in 2005 One of the most famous transportable wheels is the 60-metre ( 197 ft ) Roue de Paris , originally installed on the Place de la Concorde in Paris for the 2000 millennium celebrations . Roue de Paris left France in 2002 and in 2003\u201304 operated in Birmingham and Manchester , England . In 2005 it visited first Geleen then Amsterdam , Netherlands , before returning to England to operate at Gateshead . In 2006 it was erected at the Suan Lum Night Bazaar in Bangkok , Thailand , and by 2008 had made its way to Antwerp , Belgium . [ 149 ] Roue de Paris is a Ronald Bussink series R60 design using 40,000 litres ( 8,800 imperial gallons ; 11,000 US gallons ) of water ballast to provide a stable base . The R60 weighs 365 tonnes ( 402 short tons ) , and can be erected in 72 hours and dismantled in 60 hours by a specialist team . Transport requires seven 20-foot container lorries , ten open trailer lorries , and one closed trailer lorry . Its 42-passenger cars can be loaded either 3 or 6 at a time , and each car can carry 8 people . [ 150 ] Bussink R60 wheels have operated in Australia ( Brisbane ) , Canada ( Niagara Falls ) , France ( Paris ) , Malaysia ( Kuala Lumpur & Malacca ) , UK ( Belfast , Birmingham , Manchester , Sheffield ) , US ( Atlanta , Myrtle Beach ) , and elsewhere Other notable transportable wheels include the 60-metre ( 197 ft ) Steiger Ferris Wheel , which was the world 's tallest transportable wheel when it began operating in 1980 . [ 151 ] It has 42 passenger cars , [ 152 ] and weighs 450 tons . [ 153 ] On October 11 , 2010 , it collapsed at the Kramermarkt in Oldenburg , Germany , during deconstruction . [ 154 ]",
