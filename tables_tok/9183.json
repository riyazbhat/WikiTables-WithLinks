He murdered Terence Eve in 1974 , Robert Brown in 1975 , George Brett and his 10-year-old son Terry Brett later on in 1975 , Fred Sherwood in 1978 and Ronald Andrews later on in 1978 and was jailed in December 1979 , with the murders being committed by shooting and stabbing . He confessed to a journalist in 1998 of five more murders while in prison , he appealed against his conviction in 2014 and his whole life sentence in 2016 but was rejected each time on account of his crimes being exceptionally serious"

          "In October 1986 , he was found guilty of shooting dead his adoptive parents , sister and six-year-old twin nephews at the family farmhouse in Essex 14 months earlier , in order to claim a six-figure inheritance while also laying evidence to suggest his sister , a known schizophrenic , had committed the murders before killing herself . This was the police 's original line of inquiry and the media reported the deaths as a murder-suicide , but within weeks of the murders being committed the line of the police investigation had changed and Bamber was charged with five murders . His trial judge said in sentencing him that he found the idea of ever seeing Bamber free again difficult to foresee , and advised that he should serve at least 25 years behind bars before release could even be considered . Before the law lords ' ruling in November 2002 , Bamber was told by at least one Home Secretary that his life sentence would mean life . He has continued to protest his innocence but all appeals against his convictions have so far been unsuccessful"

          "The Gay Slayer , who set about achieving a New Year 's resolution to become a serial killer by targeting patrons of a public house frequented by gay men . Ireland pretended to be homosexual in order to be taken to each of his victims ' homes , where he took advantage of their desire for S & M activity to truss , torture and murder them , often then robbing them to cover his travelling expenses as he was unemployed . He was able to continue as police found initial difficulty in linking the killings to one perpetrator . Ireland was caught when he visited police to try and explain his sighting on closed-circuit television with his final victim , however his fingerprint was subsequently matched to one found at the man 's flat . He confessed to the other murders while in custody and pleaded guilty to all charges in court . His original recommended tariff was never publicised . Ireland remained in prison for nearly 20 years until his death on 21 February 2012 at the age of 57"
