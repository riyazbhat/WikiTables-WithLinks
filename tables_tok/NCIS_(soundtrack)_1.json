  "intro": "NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack is a series of soundtrack albums featuring music used in the CBS television series NCIS. The first volume in the series, released on February 10, 2009, received attention for its method of compiling music for the album; show producers and writers were presented previously unreleased tracks from popular artists ranging from Perry Farrell to Jakob Dylan as the shows were being crafted, and then taking inspiration from those tunes to help craft the show. This method contrasted with the norm for TV soundtracks, which tend to be compilations of previously released music that is already available individually or on other albums. NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack - Vol. 2 was released on November 3, 2009, according to\nAmazon.com."
