        "In 1908 , John T. Jones built this experimental blast furnace , named the Ardis Furnace after his daughter , to test an iron extraction process he developed . The furnace as originally built was a huge rotating metal tube installed at a slight incline and held in place by a series of concrete supports . The Ardis Furnace was initially a success , but a fundamental heat problem limited its durability , and within two years Jones lost his personal fortune and the project was abandoned . Some elements of Jones 's technology were incorporated into later successful operations , but the ruins of the concrete supports are the only remnants of the Ardis furnace",

        "The Chapin Mine Steam Pump Engine , also known as The Cornish Pump , was built by the E. P. Allis Company ( now Allis-Chalmers ) in 1890-91 , and is still the largest reciprocating steam-driven engine ever built in the United States . It was use in the 1890s at the Chapin Mine D shaft , and from 1907 to 1914 at the nearby Ludington Mine C shaft . At the C shaft , the engine was connected to a series of eight pumps , the deepest of which was 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) below ground . The total capacity of the pump system was 3,400 US gallons ( 13,000 l ) per minute . The system was replaced in 1914 by electric pumps , and the Cornish Pump has served as a tourist attraction since 1934",
