  "intro": "The Lake Biwa Mainichi Marathon (\u3073\u308f\u6e56\u6bce\u65e5\u30de\u30e9\u30bd\u30f3, Biwako Mainichi Marason) is a marathon race held in Otsu, Shiga, Japan. It is one of the prominent marathons in Japan. It is a male only competition and has IAAF Gold Label status. It was first held in 1946 and, having taken place every year since then, it is Japan's oldest annual marathon race. The early editions of the race were held in Osaka until a switch to Tokyo occurred for the 1963-64 marathons, and all subsequent races thereafter were held in Shiga Prefecture, starting in \u014ctsu fronting Lake Biwa, where the race gets its name. It is sponsored by Mainichi and was known simply as the Mainichi Marathon for a period. The race begins and ends at the Ojiyama Stadium. The Lake Biwa Marathon has been selected as the Japanese national marathon championships on dozens of occasions, starting in 1960. The current course record for the competition is 2:06:13 hours, set by Wilson Kipsang at the 2011 edition."
