        "A ginkgo tree near the village of Yogwang-ri . Reaching a height of 24 m ( 79 ft ) , the tree stands alone surrounded by flat country . The crown appears damaged from strong local winds , having lost several large branches in 1905 , 1925 , and post-liberation . Several branches are now secured to the trunk with cables , and a cavity in the lower part of the trunk has also been filled . The tree is estimated to be about 1000 years old , known by local villagers as the Haengjeon Pavilion ( \u674f\u4ead ) Gingko , after the eponymous pavilion that once stood nearby",

        "A pair of Chinese junipers at Cheonjaam , a hermitage of the Buddhist temple Songgwangsa . Situated next to Nahajeon Hall , the trees grow so close together they look as if they were joined . Only 70 cm ( 28 in ) separate the trunks , which wind and twist to a height of 12 m ( 39 ft ) . The junipers have very limited growing space , and the cavities in the trunks appear to have been extensively filled . Both are estimated to be about 800 years old . According to tradition , they took root after the monk Jinul ( 1158-1210 ) and his disciple Seongjing planted the canes they used during their travels to China",

Located near a brook in what was once a lotus pond , the trees twine around a Chinese nettle tree and reach a height of about 12 m ( 39 ft ) . The trees are estimated to be about 1000 years old . Locally , they are known as the Dragon Wisterias ( \u9f8d\u85e4 ) , a reference to either their location in the Dragon Forest ( \u9f8d\u6797 ) , which was used by the Silla king and his retainers to hunt , or to the shape of the trunks , which writhe like a dragon 's body . According to legend , placing their dried flowers into the bedding of newlyweds brings greater closeness between husband and wife",
