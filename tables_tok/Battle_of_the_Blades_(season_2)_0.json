  "intro": "The second season of Battle of the Blades premiered on September 26, 2010 as a part of CBC's fall line-up. Like season 1, this season showcased a lineup of eight couples. Ron MacLean and Kurt Browning return as the show's hosts. Sandra Bezic continued as the head judge this season, with the addition of former NHL player Jeremy Roenick as the other regular judge, replacing season 1's Dick Button. This season continued to have one rotating guest judge every week. Because Maple Leaf Gardens was undergoing renovations at the time, the venue this season was set in a sound stage at Pinewood Toronto Studios. The sound stage was transformed into a skating rink, with two-tiered seating. The elimination format changed this season. The scores from the couples' Sunday night performance were now added to the viewers voting to determine the bottom two couples. On Monday, the bottom two couples are revealed and they skate their Sunday night program once more in the Skate-Off. Instead of scoring the couples on their Skate-Off performance, this season the judges were just asked to vote on the couple of their choice. The couple with the fewest judges' votes was then eliminated."
