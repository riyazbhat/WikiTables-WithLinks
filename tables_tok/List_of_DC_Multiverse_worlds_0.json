  "section_text": "Originally , there was no consistency regarding `` numbered '' Earths\u2014they would be either spelled out as words or use numbers , even within the same story . For example , `` Crisis on Earth-Three ! '' ( Justice League of America ( vol . 1 ) # 29 ( August 1964 ) ) uses `` Earth-3 '' and `` Earth-Three '' interchangeably . However , a tradition of spelling out the numbers emerged in `` The Most Dangerous Earth '' ( Justice League of America ( vol . 1 ) # 30 ( September 1964 ) ) . This convention was disregarded in Crisis on Infinite Earths , and it became common practice to refer to the various Earths with numerals instead . Infinite Crisis used both , but Crisis On Infinite Earths : Absolute Edition and everything after 52 have referred to the alternate universes with numerals Because 52 introduced another set of Earths , The Flash : Flashpoint changed the nature of many of those Earths . The New 52 and Convergence restored the Pre-Crisis Multiverse ; all Pre-Crisis Earths below 52 are spelled out ( i.e. , Earth-Three ) , realities from the 52 Multiverse use a hyphen ( Earth-3 ) , and realities from the New 52 Multiverse use a space ( i.e. , Earth 3 ) . This helps , as The New 52 introduced a Dark Multiverse that uses negative numbers ( i.e. , Earth -3 ) Also , Earths that were `` revealed as a distinct parallel Earth in The Kingdom # 2 '' , i.e. , part of Hypertime , are marked with a `` * '' . Variations of some of these worlds appeared in the 52 and New 52 Multiverses , which are also Hypertime realties . [ 1 ]",
