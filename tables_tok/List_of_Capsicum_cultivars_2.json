Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin ( 1727\u20131817 ) , a Dutch botanist , named the species in that way in 1776 because he believed they originated in China . Most of the peppers of this species have a distinctive flavor and are similar in flavor to each other . [ citation needed ]",
  "uid": "List_of_Capsicum_cultivars_2",
  "intro": "This is a list of Capsicum cultivars belonging to the five major species of cultivated peppers (genus Capsicum): C. annuum, C. chinense, C. baccatum, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens. Due to the large and changing number of cultivars, and the variation of cultivar namings in different regions, this list only gives a few examples of the estimated 50,000 pepper varieties that exist."
