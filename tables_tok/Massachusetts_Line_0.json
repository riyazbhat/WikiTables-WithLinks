  "section_text": "On April 23 , 1775 , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress voted to raise a volunteer force of 13,600 men , and it called upon the other New England colonies for assistance in raising an army of 30,000 men . [ 7 ] The Massachusetts provincials were raised in the spring of 1775 and were eventually formed into twenty-six infantry regiments . Massachusetts also took responsibility for a twenty-seventh regiment , originally raised in New Hampshire . [ 8 ] Massachusetts regiments had an official establishment of 599 officers and men in ten companies [ 9 ] ( but five regiments had an eleventh company ) . The troops were enlisted to serve until December 31 , 1775 . [ 10 ] The commissions of all Massachusetts officers were dated May 19 , 1775 . [ 10 ] Subsequently the regiments were numbered , although in Massachusetts the regiment was commonly identified by the name of its colonel .

This was done on June 14 , 1775 , and these troops were designated the Continental Army . [ 12 ] George Washington was selected as commander in chief of this force , and all other Continental Army troops , the following day . [ 13 ]",

  "intro": "The Massachusetts Line was the name given to those units within the Continental Army that were assigned to Massachusetts at various times by the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. These, together with similar contingents from the other twelve states, formed the Continental Line. Line regiments were assigned to a particular state, which was then financially responsible for the maintenance (staffing and supplying) of the regiment. The concept of the line was also particularly important in relation to the promotion of commissioned officers. Officers of the Continental Army below the rank of brigadier general were ordinarily ineligible for promotion except in the line of their own state. The size of the Massachusetts Line varied from as many as 27 active regiments (at the outset of the war) to four (at its end). For most of the war after the Siege of Boston (April 1775 to March 1776) almost all of these units were deployed outside Massachusetts, serving as far north as Quebec City, as far west as present-day central Upstate New York, and as far south as Yorktown, Virginia. Massachusetts line troops were involved in most of the war's major battles north of Chesapeake Bay, and were present at the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781. General officers of the line included Major Generals Artemas Ward, William Heath, and Benjamin Lincoln, and Brigadier Generals John Glover and John Nixon."
