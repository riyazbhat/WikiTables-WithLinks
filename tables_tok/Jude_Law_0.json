He has received multiple award nominations including for two Academy Awards, four Golden Globes Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. In 2007, he received an Honorary C\u00e9sar and was named a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts. Born and raised in London, Law started acting in theatre. After finding small roles in feature films, Law gained recognition for his role in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. He found further critical and commercial success in Enemy at the Gates (2001), Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition (2002). He gave an acclaimed performance in the war film Cold Mountain (2003), earning him Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. Law went on to star in several commercially unsuccessful films, including Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) and Alfie (2004). He then starred in romantic comedies Closer (2004) and The Holiday (2006) which were well-received. He also portrayed Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). In the 2010s, Law appeared in Repo Men (2010) and had supporting roles in Contagion (2011) and the 3D film Hugo (2011)."
