  "intro": "Ding Junhui (Chinese: \u4e01\u4fca\u6656; born 1 April 1987) is a Chinese professional snooker player who has been considered the most successful Asian player in the history of the sport. Throughout his career, he has won 14 major ranking titles, including three UK Championships in 2005, 2009, and 2019; two Shanghai Masters titles in 2013 and 2016; and one German Masters title in 2014. He has also twice reached the final of the Masters, winning once in 2011. Representing China at the Asian Games, Ding has won five gold medals in individual and team events. In 2016, he became the first Asian player to reach the final of the World Championship. The same year, he won his first Six-red World Championship. Ding began playing snooker at age nine and rose to international prominence in 2002 after winning the Asian Under-21 Championship, the Asian Championship. At age 15, he became the youngest winner of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship. In 2003, Ding turned professional at the age of 16. His first major professional successes came in 2005 when he won the China Open and the UK Championship, becoming the first player from outside Great Britain and Ireland to win the title. In the 2013/2014 season, Ding tied Stephen Hendry's record of winning five ranking titles in a single season. During his career, Ding - who is known as a prolific break-builder - has compiled more than 500 century breaks, including six maximum breaks, in professional play."
