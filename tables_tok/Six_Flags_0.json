  "intro": "Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, also known as Six Flags Theme Parks or simply Six Flags, is an amusement park corporation based in the United States, with properties in Canada, Mexico, and the contiguous United States. It owns more theme parks and waterparks combined than any other amusement park company in the world, and has the seventh-highest attendance in the world. The company operates 25 properties throughout North America, including theme parks, amusement parks, water parks and a family entertainment center. In 2017, Six Flags properties hosted 30.4 million guests. Six Flags was founded in Texas on August 5, 1961 and derived its name from its first property, Six Flags Over Texas. The company maintains a corporate office in Midtown Manhattan, while its headquarters are in Grand Prairie, Texas. On June 13, 2009, the corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to crippling debt, which it successfully exited after corporate restructuring on May 3, 2010."
