  "intro": "Tau Kappa Epsilon brothers (commonly referred to as Tekes) are individuals who have been initiated into Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity. The fraternity was founded by the five men of Joseph Lorenzo Settles, James Carson McNutt, Clarence Arthur Mayer, Owen Ison Truitt, and Charles Roy Atkinson on January 10, 1899, at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois. Members traditionally initiate into a chapter during their collegiate career, although honorary members may not necessary have attended a university or college. The list of Tau Kappa Epsilon brothers spans over multiple careers including politics, business, athletics, and entertainment. Among the most recognized include U.S. President Ronald Reagan who was the recipient of the Order of the Golden Eagle, the fraternity's highest honor. Other widely recognized political figures include former West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, who at the time of his death was the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress, and former Arkansas Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who while running for president launched a TKE-specific website and visited Tekes on the campaign trail. Dozens of top CEOs and university presidents have also made the list such as Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, and Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, who was the fraternity's 250,000th initiate. Numerous athletic and music superstars are also Tekes including NFL quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw, Phil Simms, and Aaron Rodgers, Olympians Douglas Blubaugh, Sim Iness, and Johnny Quinn, and singers Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and the Everly Brothers."
