It took place on 28 February 2009 at the Yash Raj Studios, Mumbai. Actors Ranbir Kapoor and Imran Khan hosted the show for the first part, while actresses Konkona Sen Sharma and Deepika Padukone hosted the show in the latter part. It was the first time that any of these actors hosted the awards ceremony. The ceremony was televised in India eight days later, on 8 March 2009. The nominees for the various films were announced on 16 February 2009. The films Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and Rock On!! led the nominations with a total of ten nominations each, followed by Jodhaa Akbar with nine nominations. Ghajini and Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na had seven nominations each. The nominations are for the major awards only, as there were no list of nominees for the technical and other awards. The major award-winning film turned out to be Jodhaa Akbar and Rock On! !, both of which won five Filmfare Awards each."
