  "intro": "Sydney Showground Stadium (currently known by its commercial name Giants Stadium,, and previously known as Spotless Stadium from 2014 to 2019 and \u0160koda Stadium from 2012 to 2014) is a sports and events stadium located at the Sydney Showground in Sydney Olympic Park. It hosted the baseball events for the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Showground, including the stadium, is operated by the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW (RAS), under lease from the New South Wales Government. The stadium hosts flagship events of the Sydney Royal Easter Show, such as the Grand Parade. The stadium is also used for sport. It is the primary home ground of the Australian Football League's Greater Western Sydney Giants and the home ground of the Big Bash League's Sydney Thunder. It was also the primary home ground of the A-League's Western Sydney Wanderers during the 2016-17 A-League season. Events and festivals to have been held at the stadium include Soundwave, Big Day Out, Stereosonic and Big Exo Day. The stadium opened in 1998 as the Sydney Showground Main Arena. In conjunction with an expansion and upgrade in 2011-12, it was renamed Sydney Showground Stadium."
