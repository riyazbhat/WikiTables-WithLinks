  "uid": "Triple_J_Hottest_100,_2012_1",
  "intro": "The 2012 Triple J Hottest 100 was announced on Australia Day 26 January 2013. It was the 20th countdown of the most popular songs of the year, as chosen by the listeners of Australian radio station Triple J. Voting commenced on 19 December 2012, and closed at midnight on 20 January 2013. Over 1.5 million votes were cast in this countdown, beating the record set in the 2011 list. In the week prior to the countdown, Nick Drewe, a Brisbane statistician and marketer, analysed the votes that had been published on social media and determined the possible top 100, naming it the Warmest 100. The votes that had been published represented approximately 2.7% of the total vote. Ultimately, his list correctly predicted 92 of the songs in the countdown, the songs comprising the top 10, and the top 3 in the correct order. The ABC have announced that it would likely make changes to the voting system to prevent spoiler attempts in future countdowns."
