        "A bomb exploded outside a busy department store in General Santos , killing 13 people . Two other bombs went off in quick succession near a radio station and a bus terminal also in General Santos . The series of blasts injured at least 60 people , while the dead included four children . Police said they received an anonymous call claiming 18 bombs had been planted around the largely Christian city of 800,000 people in the predominantly Muslim south . Earlier in the year the so-called Indigenous People 's Federal Army had planted more than a dozen fake bombs in the area , saying they would use real bombs if their demands were not met . Police later arrested two men , members of a Muslim extremist group , based on the description from witnesses who saw one of the men place the small , homemade bomb outside the Fit Mart department store in the mall . Abu Sayyaf claimed responsibility for the incident",
