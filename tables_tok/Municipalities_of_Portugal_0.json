  "section_text": "See also : List of municipalities of Portugal There are 308 municipalities in Portugal : 278 in mainland Portugal and 30 in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira . They are usually named for their biggest city , or at least , their historically most important city or town . However , the municipality is not synonymous with the city ( or urban centre ) , and can include various towns or cities . In Portugal , cities/towns are a social distinction based on population size and associated services , and have no legal representation in law or constitution . Before the 2013 local government reforms , Portugal was divided into 18 continental districts ( Portuguese : distritos ) and two autonomous regions ( Portuguese : regi\u00f5es aut\u00f3nomas ) , Azores and Madeira . The table below is the distribution of the municipalities within these districts and the autonomous regions : The 18 districts and 2 autonomous regions of Portugal , subdivided into their municipalities .",

  "intro": "The municipality (Portuguese: munic\u00edpio or concelho) is the second-level administrative subdivision of Portugal, as defined by the 1976 Constitution. As a general rule, each municipality is further subdivided into parishes (freguesias); the municipalities in the north of the country usually have a higher number of parishes. Six municipalities are composed of only one parish, and Barcelos is the municipality with most parishes, with 61. Corvo is, by law, the only municipality with no parishes. Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese municipalities have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the municipal chamber) and a deliberative body (the municipal assembly). The municipal chamber is the executive body and is composed of the president of the municipality and a number of councillors proportional to the municipality's population. The municipal assembly is composed of the presidents of all the parishes that compose the municipality, as well as by a number of directly elected deputies, at least equal to the number of parish presidents plus one. Both bodies are elected for four years. Portugal has an entirely separate system of cities and towns. Cities and towns are located in municipalities but often do not have the same boundaries, even they are continuously built up. There are around twice as many cities and towns as there are municipalities."
