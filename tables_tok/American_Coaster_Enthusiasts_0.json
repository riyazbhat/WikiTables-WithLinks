  "section_title": "Awards -- ACE Coasters Classics",
  "section_text": "The ACE Coaster Classic award was developed during a period when changes in the design , equipping , and operation of wood coasters threatened to erase these time-honored experiences and rituals . The award is designed to recognize coasters that still adhere to these principles while allowing riders to safely experience the thrill of the classic wooden roller coaster ride . To be eligible for ACE Coaster Classic status , the coaster must meet the following criteria : [ 10 ] Traditional lap bars that allow riders to experience so-called airtime , or negative G 's , the sensation of floating above the seat , must be installed . Individual , ratcheting lap bars do not meet this requirement . Riders must be able to slide from side-to-side in their seats . A coaster with any restraint or device that restricts this freedom , like seat dividers between riders , does not meet this requirement . Riders must be able to view upcoming drops and thrills . A coaster with headrests on every seat or the majority of seats that restrict this view does not meet this requirement . Riders must be free to choose where they sit . A coaster where riders are assigned seats before boarding does not meet this requirement The amusement park or theme park operating a coaster that is recognized as a Coaster Classic is usually presented a custom plaque . The plaque typically states : \u201c THE AMERICAN COASTER ENTHUSIASTS RECOGNIZES THIS COASTER AS AN ACE COASTER CLASSIC . ACE salutes this park for maintaining this coaster as an American treasure in its purest form . We congratulate you for the use of traditional materials , methods and equipment , which are fundamental to the classic wooden roller coaster experience . ACE commends this park for operating this coaster in the traditional manner so that future generations may enjoy its classic thrills and its enduring popularity . \u201d",
