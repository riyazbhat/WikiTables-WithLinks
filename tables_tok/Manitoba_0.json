  "section_text": "Main article : Climate of Manitoba Deep Lake at Riding Mountain National Park Manitoba has an extreme continental climate . Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase from east to west . [ 17 ] Manitoba is far from the moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water . Because of the generally flat landscape , it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February . In the summer , air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States , as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico . [ 18 ] Temperatures exceed 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) numerous times each summer , and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid-40s . [ 19 ] Carman , Manitoba recorded the second-highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007 , with 53.0 . [ 20 ] According to Environment Canada , Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round , and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring . [ 21 ] Southern Manitoba ( including the city of Winnipeg ) , falls into the humid continental climate zone ( K\u00f6ppen Dfb ) . This area is cold and windy in the winter and often has blizzards because of the open landscape . Summers are warm with a moderate length . This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces , with moderate precipitation . Southwestern Manitoba , though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba , is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser 's Triangle . The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba . [ 22 ] This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the Canadian Prairie landscape . [ 22 ] Summers are generally warm to hot , with low to moderate humidity . [ 22 ] Southern parts of the province just north of Tornado Alley , experience tornadoes , with 16 confirmed touchdowns in 2016 . In 2007 , on 22 and 23 June , numerous tornadoes touched down , the largest an F5 tornado that devastated parts of Elie ( the strongest recorded tornado in Canada ) . [ 23 ] K\u00f6ppen climate types of Manitoba The province 's northern sections ( including the city of Thompson ) fall in the subarctic climate zone ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc ) . This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief , warm summers with little precipitation . [ 24 ] Overnight temperatures as low as \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) occur on several days each winter . [ 24 ]",

  "intro": "Manitoba (/\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ (listen)) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and is Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people. Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres (250,900 sq mi) with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province. Manitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada."
