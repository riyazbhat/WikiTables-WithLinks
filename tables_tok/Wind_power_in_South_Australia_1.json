  "uid": "Wind_power_in_South_Australia_1",
  "intro": "Wind power became a significant energy source within South Australia over the first two decades of the 21st century. As of 2015, there was an installed capacity of 1,475 MW, which accounts for 34% of electricity production in the state. This represents 35% of Australia's installed wind power capacity. The development of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged by a number of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state. The load factor (or capacity factor) for South Australian wind farms is usually in the range 32-38%. This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38% of its nameplate capacity averaged over a year."
