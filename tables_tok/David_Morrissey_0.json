  "intro": "David Mark Morrissey (born 21 June 1964) is an English actor, director, producer, and screenwriter. At the age of 18, Morrissey was cast in the television series One Summer (1983), and subsequently attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before acting with the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre for four years. Throughout the 1990s, he often portrayed policemen and soldiers, though he also played Bradley Headstone in Our Mutual Friend (1998) and Christopher Finzi in Hilary and Jackie (1998). He then had roles in Some Voices (2000) and Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001), before he played the critically acclaimed roles of Stephen Collins in State of Play (2003) and Gordon Brown in The Deal (2003). The former earned him a Best Actor nomination at the British Academy Television Awards and the latter won him a Best Actor award from the Royal Television Society. In the years following those films, Morrissey had roles in The Reaping (2007), Sense and Sensibility (2008), Red Riding (2009), Nowhere Boy (2009), and Centurion (2010). He also produced and starred in the crime drama Thorne (2010). Morrissey returned to the stage in 2008 for a run of Neil LaBute's In a Dark Dark House and played the title role in the Liverpool Everyman's production of Macbeth in 2011. He then starred in the British crime film Blitz, playing a morally dubious reporter in contact with the eponymous cop killer. The following year, he began portraying The Governor in the third, fourth, and fifth seasons of the AMC horror-drama series The Walking Dead. The British Film Institute describes Morrissey as being considered one of the most versatile English actors of his generation, and he is noted for his meticulous preparation for and research into the roles he plays. He has directed short films and the television dramas Sweet Revenge (2001) and Passer By (2004)."
