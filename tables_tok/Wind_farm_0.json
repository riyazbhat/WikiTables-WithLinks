  "intro": "A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Wind farms vary in size from a small number of turbines to several hundred wind turbines covering an extensive area. Wind farms can be either onshore or offshore. Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the largest wind farm in the world, Gansu Wind Farm in China had a capacity of over 6,000 MW by 2012, with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. As of September 2018, the 659 MW Walney Wind Farm in the UK is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. Wind farms tend to have much less impact on the environment than many other power stations. Onshore wind farms are also criticized for their visual impact and impact on the landscape, as typically they need to take up more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to industrialization of the countryside, habitat loss, and a drop in tourism. Critics have linked wind farms to adverse health effects (see wind turbine syndrome). Wind farms have also been criticized for interfering with radar, radio and television reception."
