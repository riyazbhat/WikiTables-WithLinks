This bronze gallic cock can be seen throughout France being one of \u00c9tablissements Rombaux-Roland 's most popular pieces . Sometimes the cock stood on a half - globe with laurels or on a full globe or as at Remy on a flat platform . As was usual with \u00c9tablissements Rombaux-Roland the sculptor remains anonymous",

The plaster model of this work , entitled je t'ai cherch\u00e9 was exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7aise in 1920 and there are several examples of the work in monuments throughout France . It was said that the likeness of the soldier was based on Charles Eudes , one of Maxime Real del Sarte 's comrades at the front . Maxime Real Del Sarte was recommended as the sculptor for the Ressons-sur-Matz war memorial by the writer Binet-Valmer who had taken part in the liberation of the village in 1918 . The war memorial at Ressons-sur-Matz was completed in 1924",

The war memorial at Dreslincourt was erected three years later and is an obelisk surmounted by a Croix de guerre .

        "Maxime Real del Sarte 's composition features a group of three soldiers in attack mode . Reportedly the soldier in the centre was meant to represent a likeness of General Gouraud . The soldier on the right was supposedly based on Quentin Roosevelt , the nephew of Theodore Roosevelt who was killed near Cambrai on 14 July 1918 , and the soldier on the left was said to be based on Maxime Real del Sarte 's brother , killed in the Champagne during the war . Del Sarte himself was injured fighting in the \u00c9parges section of the Verdun front on 29 January 1916 and part of his left arm had to be amputated . The monument remembers the efforts of the French army units who fought in the area",

        "The relief on the Saint-Samson-la-Poterie war memorial is by Louis Maubert . It is dated 1921 and was inaugurated on 9 October 1921 . The design and model of the relief was made in 1916 when it first became obvious that a monument was going to be needed by each and every community . The organisation Souvenir Fran\u00e7ais intended that this design to be the official monument , but the work was subject to criticism and the concept of a monopoly for war memorials was unpopular . This work was marketed by \u00c9tablissements Hubert Coignet et Cie of Gennevilliers in Hauts-de-Seine . Amongst Maubert 's other works are the monument commemorating Leon Chiris in Grasse , Alpes-Maritimes and a bas-relief on the tomb of Montaud Deluns in Clamart , Hauts-de-Seine . Maubert was also the sculptor of the war memorial of Mazingarbe",
