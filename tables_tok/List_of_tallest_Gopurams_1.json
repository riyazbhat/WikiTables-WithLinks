The temple was built in the 11th century atop its ruins by the progenitor of the Eastern Ganga dynasty , King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva . The temple is famous for its annual Rath Yatra , or chariot festival , in which the three main temple deities are hauled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars . Since medieval times , it is also associated with intense religious fervour",

        "The Vimana with its recessed corners and upward movement presents a striking contrast to the straight-sided pyramidal tower of Thanjavur but with octagon shape of Dravidian architecture . As it rises to a height of 182 feet ( 55 m ) and is shorter than the Thanjavur tower with larger plinth , it is often described as the feminine counterpart of the Thanjavur temple . The Vimana is flanked on either side by small temples ; the one in the north now housing the Goddess is fairly well preserved . The small shrine of Chandikesvara is near the steps in the north . In the north-east are a shire housing Durga , a well called lion-well ( simhakeni ) with a lion figure guarding its steps and a late mandapa housing the office . Nandi is in the east facing the main shrine . In the same direction is the ruined gopura , the entrance tower . The main tower surrounded by little shrines truly presents the appearance of a great Chakravarti ( emperor ) surrounded by chieftains and vassals . The Gangaikondacholapuram Vimana is undoubtedly a devalaya chakravarti , an emperor among temples of South India",
