  "section_text": "Nara period Buddhism was dominated by six state-controlled sects . They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara . These schools were generally academic in nature , closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was far removed from the daily life of the people . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] In 804 , two Japanese monks K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d travelled to China ; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively . Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people . Though their origins lay in China , with time they acquired local Japanese traits . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan . Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language , including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects . [ 64 ] A number of new sects appeared in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mapp\u014d . [ nb 7 ] [ 65 ] Growing out of an Amida cult , the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran , and attracted a following from all classes and occupations . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Three years later , D\u014dgen introduced the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice . [ 68 ] The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren 's proclamation of his teachings in 1253 . Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant . [ 65 ] The central focus of Nichiren 's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra . [ 65 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Fourteen treatises and commentaries of famous Japanese monks dating from the early Heian to the Kamakura period have been designated as National Treasures . These include three commentaries by K\u016bkai on two of the main mantras ( Dainichiky\u014d and Kong\u014dhannyaky\u014d ) of Shingon Buddhism , works by Shinran discussing Pure Land Buddhism , mapp\u014d and Amida , a manual on zazen `` seated meditation '' by D\u014dgen and two works by Nichiren related to his teachings . In addition two large scale collection of documents from the Nara to the Meiji period are listed here as National Treasures . [ 4 ]",
