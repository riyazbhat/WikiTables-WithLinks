  "intro": "County borough is a term introduced in 1889 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (excluding Scotland), to refer to a borough or a city independent of county council control, similar to the unitary authorities created since the 1990s. They were abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales, but continue in use for lieutenancy and shrievalty in Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland they remain in existence but have been renamed cities under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain principal areas in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time - Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow - were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system, which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire."
