These games provided a field hockey gold after 20 years at the Asian Games, the country's eight overall, and also its first major title since winning the 1994 World Cup in Sydney, Australia. It also saw Pakistan become gold medallist in the inaugural events of cricket (women) and squash team (men's). Pakistan had also won the inaugural squash singles (men's) event at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand."
