  "intro": "This list of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorors (commonly referred to as AKAs) includes initiated and honorary members of Alpha Kappa Alpha (\u0391\u039a\u0391), the first inter-collegiate Greek-letter sorority established for Black college women. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority was founded on January 15, 1908, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., by nine women who were known as The Original Group of 1908, and seven sophomores, who were accepted as honor initiates and are known as The Sophomores of 1910. Alpha Kappa Alpha has a membership of more than 200,000 women in over 950 chapters in the United States and several other countries. Membership is extended to female college undergraduate and graduate students. The sorority also bestows honorary membership as its highest honor."
