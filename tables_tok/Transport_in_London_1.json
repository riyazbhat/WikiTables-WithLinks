  "section_title": "Heavy rail -- Local and regional",
  "section_text": "Thameslink trains run a cross London route through Central London Unlike the Underground , which is a single system owned and operated by Transport for London , commuter railways in London are run by a number of separate train operating companies ( TOCs ) . This results from the privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s which split the former state railway operator British Rail into a number of smaller franchises in order to increase competition and allow railways to operate in a free market . Among the rail firms operating passenger services in London , a number are owned by foreign companies or by state-owned railways of other European countries . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] London Overground is contracted in a different way to other franchises in that it is operated by a private company under contract to Transport for London . Heathrow Express is also unusual in that it is not officially part of the National Rail franchising system .",
  "uid": "Transport_in_London_1",
  "intro": "London has an extensive and developed transport network which includes both private and public services. Journeys made by public transport systems account for 37% of London's journeys while private services accounted for 36% of journeys, walking 24% and cycling 2%. London's public transport network serves as the central hub for the United Kingdom in rail, air and road transport. Public transport services are dominated by the executive agency for transport in London: Transport for London (TfL). TfL controls the majority of public transport, including the Underground, Buses, Tramlink, the Docklands Light Railway, London River Services and the London Overground. Other rail services are either franchised to train operating companies by the Department for Transport (DfT) or, like Eurostar and Heathrow Express, operated on an open-access basis. TfL also controls most major roads in London, but not minor roads. In addition, there are several independent airports serving London, including Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe."
