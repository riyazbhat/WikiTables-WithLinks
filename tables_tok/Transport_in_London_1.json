  "section_text": "Thameslink trains run a cross London route through Central London Unlike the Underground , which is a single system owned and operated by Transport for London , commuter railways in London are run by a number of separate train operating companies ( TOCs ) . This results from the privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s which split the former state railway operator British Rail into a number of smaller franchises in order to increase competition and allow railways to operate in a free market Among the rail firms operating passenger services in London , a number are owned by foreign companies or by state-owned railways of other European countries . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] London Overground is contracted in a different way to other franchises in that it is operated by a private company under contract to Transport for London . Heathrow Express is also unusual in that it is not officially part of the National Rail franchising system",
