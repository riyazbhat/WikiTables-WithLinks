  "section_text": "In response to my question as to what will happen to Schulberg , he [ Lasky ] said , in effect , that they would be kicking him upstairs . \u2026 One of my rows with Paramount \u2026 was my insistence that no one man could possibly personally produce more than a few pictures per year . \u2014 David O. Selznick [ 23 ] In early 1928 Selznick accepted the position of assistant to producer B. P. Schulberg at Paramount Studios . The professional relationship between the two , however , eventually deteriorated after Schulberg went to Europe for several months in 1929 . During his absence , studio head Jesse L. Lasky placed Selznick into Schulberg 's position and decided to keep him there . Selznick remained with Paramount until his resignation in June 1931",
