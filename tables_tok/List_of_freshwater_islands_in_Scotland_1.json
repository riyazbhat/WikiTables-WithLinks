Several of the islands are , or have in the past , been inhabited ; there are two castles and the remains of a chapel on the islands . [ 20 ] Inistrynich , Eilean na Maodail , Eilean Dubh and Liever Island are all promontories as opposed to islands despite their names . The loch 's water levels have fluctuated so some of them may have been islands in recent history , as the promontory on which Kilchurn Castle stands once was . [ 21 ] There may be up to sixty islands in the Loch Lomond including Inchmurrin , the largest freshwater island anywhere in the Britain and Ireland , and Inchconnachan , which has hosted a small population of Red-necked Wallaby since at least 1975 . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The isolated strongholds of Lochindorb Castle and Loch an Eilein Castle were once in the hands of the 14th century nobleman Alexander Stewart , the infamous `` Wolf of Badenoch '' . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] There are numerous unnamed small islands in mainland lochs , including those where the water level has been artificially raised by the creation of dams for the production of hydro-electricity . This process has created new islands that would previously have been small eminences . [ 26 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_freshwater_islands_in_Scotland_1",
  "intro": "The freshwater islands in Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers - including tidal areas, so the islands may not always be surrounded by freshwater. It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides. [Note 1]\n The more notable freshwater islands include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have had a role to play in Scottish history. Inchmurrin, the largest freshwater island in the British Isles, is in Loch Lomond, which contains thirty or more other islands. [Note 2]\n Various names are used repeatedly. Inch or Innis is a Scots word that can mean island (although it is also used for terra firma surrounded by marsh). Similarly, Eilean is the Gaelic for island. -holm is a common suffix for offshore islands in the north of Scotland and is derived from the Old Norse holmr, meaning a small and rounded islet. This list excludes artificial crann\u00f3gs and the numerous small freshwater islands with no recorded name. [Note 3][Note 4]"
