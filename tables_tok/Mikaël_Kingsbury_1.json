  "intro": "Mika\u00ebl Kingsbury (born 24 July 1992) is a Canadian freestyle skier and is the most accomplished mogul skier of all time. He achieved eminence early in his career after earning the 2009-10 FIS World Cup Rookie of the Year award. He is the seven-time reigning FIS Freestyle World Cup title-holder for both moguls and overall freestyle, owning the records for most men's Moguls World Cup titles and Overall Freestyle World Cup titles. He also owns the records for career World Cup moguls victories with 53, and consecutive Freestyle World Cup event wins with 13. He is the first man to have won both the moguls and dual moguls World Championship events, and has won the most medals at the Freestyle World Championships of any male competitor in history, having won a medal in 7 of the 8 events. Kingsbury won the Olympic silver medal in 2014, and, at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, he won the gold medal as Olympic champion of men's moguls."
