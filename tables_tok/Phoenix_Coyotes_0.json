  "intro": "The Arizona Coyotes are a professional ice hockey team based in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona. They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Coyotes first played at America West Arena in downtown Phoenix, before moving to Glendale's Gila River Arena in 2003. In 2021, the Coyotes are scheduled to return to the Central Division when an expansion team in Seattle joins the league. The Coyotes were founded on December 27, 1971, as the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association (WHA). After the WHA had ceased operations, they were one of four franchises absorbed into the National Hockey League and then granted membership on June 22, 1979. The Jets moved to Phoenix on July 1, 1996, and were renamed the Phoenix Coyotes. In 2014, the team was re-named to the present Arizona Coyotes. The Coyotes are owned by Alex Meruelo, who purchased the club in 2019. The team is known for its instability under prior ownership. The NHL took ownership of the Phoenix Coyotes franchise in 2009 after then-owner Jerry Moyes turned it over to the league after declaring bankruptcy and the league kept control of the team until 2013 when they were able to find ownership willing to keep the team in Arizona. The Coyotes continue to be at odds with the city of Glendale and the use of Gila River Arena, but has signed a lease through the 2019-20 season."
