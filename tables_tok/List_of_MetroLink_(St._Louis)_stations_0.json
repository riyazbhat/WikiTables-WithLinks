  "intro": "MetroLink is a light rail transit system serving the Greater St. Louis area in the United States. The system is operated by the Bi-State Development Agency, which since 2003 has done business as Metro. With an average weekday ridership of 56,900 in 2014, MetroLink is the twelfth-busiest light rail system in the United States. The system currently has 38 stations; 13 are served only by the Red Line, nine only by the Blue Line, and the other 16 by both lines. Thirteen stations are located in the City of St. Louis, Missouri; 14 in St. Louis County, Missouri; and 11 in St. Clair County, Illinois. Central West End is the busiest station by daily ridership, Sunnen the least busy. MetroLink began service on July 31, 1993, on the Red Line segment from North Hanley station to 5th & Missouri station. An infill station at East Riverfront and an extension to Lambert-St. Louis International Airport opened in 1994, followed by a second station at the airport in 1998. Since then, the system has had two major expansions. The first expansion, the St. Clair County Extension, extended the Red Line to Belleville, Illinois, in 2001 and to Scott Air Force Base two years later. The second major expansion, the Cross County Extension, was completed in 2006, adding the Blue Line branch from Forest Park-DeBaliviere station to Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 station via Clayton, Missouri. An additional infill station, Cortex station, opened in 2018, next to the Cortex Innovation Community."
