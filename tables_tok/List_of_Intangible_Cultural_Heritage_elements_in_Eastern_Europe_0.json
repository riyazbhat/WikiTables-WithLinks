The event involves the performance of the folk drama Tsar Maximilian , a religious drama about Maximilian , the pagan tsar , and Afolf , his son . Children are chosen to perform as the characters dzad and babam , or old man and old lady . Each year , the celebration draws in around five hundred men , who take part by performing as tsars for families that have unwed daughters . Interest in the event is waning among the youth of the region , leading to concerns by UNESCO that the heritage will be lost",
