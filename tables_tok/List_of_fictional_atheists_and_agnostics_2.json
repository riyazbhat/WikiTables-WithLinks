        "During his duel with Ezio Auditore da Firenze at the Vatican Vault , after failing to activate the Vault door because he did not have any First Civilization DNA in him , Rodrigo told to Ezio in the middle of the duel that he looked for God in the vault , shocking Ezio , which led to the latter to ask whether God was really in the Vault . Rodrigo replied that God being in the Vatican vault was a more logical answer and far more interesting than God being in the sky with angels singing cherubim all around . Ezio then asked what God would do once Rodrigo entered the vault . Rodrigo replied he was only after power , which Ezio asked whether God would give it up easily . Rodrigo then told that whatever lay beyond the Vault wall would not be able to resist the Staff and Apple and that they were made for felling gods . Ezio , being already a believer , replied that God was omniscient and omnipotent , and that mere artifacts could not harm Him , to which Rodrigo falsely accused Ezio that he took up the image of God from other men . Ezio was shocked to learn of Rodrigo 's atheism and rejection of the Bible , despite his papacy . Rodrigo then scoffed that Ezio was still too naive . Rodrigo then replied : I became Pope because it gave me ACCESS . It gave me POWER . Do you think I believe a single god-damned word of that ridiculous book ? It 's all lies and superstition . Just like every OTHER religious tract written over the past ten thousand years",

        "During his final fight with Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad in Masyaf and brief talks about the Apple of Eden while the latter was bound by the Apple 's powers , Al Mualim confirmed that Alta\u00efr was immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden , to which Alta\u00efr asked what illusion it was . Al Mualim said : That 's all it 's ever done , this Templar treasure , this Piece of Eden , this word of God . Do you understand now ? The Red Sea was never parted , water never turned to wine . It was not the machinations of Eris that spawned the Trojan War , but this ! Illusions , all of them ! Alta\u00efr argued that what Al Mualim had planned was no less than an illusion , to force men to work for him against their will . Al Mualim then denies the existence of any God whatsoever , by saying : Is it any less real than the phantoms the Saracens and Crusaders follow now ? Those craven Gods , who retreat from this world that men might slaughter one another in their names ? They live amongst an illusion already . I 'm simply giving them another , one that demands less blood . Alta\u00efr then said that they were safer choosing these phantoms , confirming that it was better to believe in some higher entity than believing in nothing at all . Al Mualim was disappointed , claiming that logic had left Alta\u00efr 's mind and was replaced with emotion . Still unconvinced , Alta\u00efr was released from being bound to the Apple 's power , after which he swiftly defeated Al Mualim in combat with some difficulty , finally ending his Mentor 's life by plunging his Hidden Blade into his throat . During Al Mualim 's final moments , he tells Alta\u00efr to take the Apple , to which Alta\u00efr replied to his Mentor that he held fire in his hand , which should have been destroyed . Al Mualim was not convinced even then , believing that the Apple could end the Crusades and create true peace and that he would never destroy it . Alta\u00efr then promised him that he would destroy it , with the latter dying after challenging his student to truly destroy it",

Alta\u00efr , much like Arno Dorian , professed the Assassin 's creed in strongly atheistic terms and called the light of God as a light that blinds society and forces it to stumble about in ignorance",
