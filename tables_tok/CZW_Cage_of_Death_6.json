One saw Team Ca $ h ( Chri $ Ca $ h , J.C. Bailey , Nate Webb , and SeXXXy Eddy ) defeat Team Blackout ( Ruckus , Sabian , Eddie Kingston , and Jack Evans ) . The other match saw the battle of The H8 Club as Wifebeater and Justice Pain took on Nate Hatred and Nick Gage . For Cage of Death 6 there were eliminations that would happen when a wrestler would hit the arena floor much like Cage of Death 5 the year before , the difference being that the tag team titles were hanging on a scaffold stretched across the length of the top of the cage overlooking the two rings . [ 7 ] In the 4 on 4 WarGames elimination match , wrestlers were eliminated when they hit the floor . The cage surrounded two rings , weapons littered around two rings , and there was also a scaffold on top of the cage where Maven Bentley and Robbie Mireno were holding the CZW Tag Team belts The other Cage of Death match was a Fans Bring the Weapons match inside the cage . Wifebeater and Justice Pain won after Nick Gage turned on Nate Hatred by driving him through a pane of glass covered in salt and thumbtacks . Immediately after the match Pain and Gage turned on Wifebeater",
