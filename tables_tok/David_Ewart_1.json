  "intro": "David Ewart, ISO (18 February 1841 - 6 June 1921) was a Canadian architect who served as Chief Dominion Architect from 1896 to 1914. As chief government architect he was responsible for many of the federal buildings constructed in this period. He broke with the Neo-Gothic style adopted by his predecessors Thomas Seaton Scott and Thomas Fuller; rather he embraced the Baronial style exemplified in several important buildings."
