The Thunderbolt and the Jack Rabbit , both wooden coasters , place the lift chain in the middle of the ride , not at the beginning . In both cases , the car leaves the station and drops into a valley for its first hill . Phantom 's Revenge uses the same valley as the Thunderbolt , where the Phantom 's second drop passes through the supports of the Thunderbolt 's first drop , making the second drop the longest and steepest drop in the ride",
