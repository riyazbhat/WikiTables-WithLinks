Its founder , Vukan , took the title of Grand Prince when his uncle and overlord Constantine Bodin ended up in Byzantine prison after decades of revolt . While Duklja was struck with civil wars , Ra\u0161ka continued the fight against the Byzantines . It was ruled by the Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty , who managed to put most of the former Serbian state under their rule , as well as expanding to the south and east"

Its central region of Pelagonia , with the city of Prilep , was held by lord Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 , who in 1365 became Serbian king and co-ruler of Serbian emperor Stefan Uro\u0161 V ( 1355-1371 ) . After king Vuka\u0161in died at the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 , the realm was obtained by his son and designated successor ( rex iunior ) Marko Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 , who took the title of Serbian king . At that time , capital cities of the Serbian realm were Skopje and Prizren , but during the following years king Marko lost effective control over those regions , and moved his residence to Prilep . He ruled there until his death in the Battle of Rovine in 1395 . By the end of the same year , the Realm of late King Marko was conquered by Ottoman Turks"

Zeta was a crown land of the Grand Principality and Kingdom of Serbia , ruled by heirs to the Serbian throne from the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty . In the mid-14th century , Zeta was divided into Upper and Lower Zeta , governed by magnates . After Stefan Du\u0161an ( r. 1331 - 55 ) , his son Stefan Uro\u0161 V ruled Serbia during the fall of the Serbian Empire ; a gradual disintegration of the Empire as a result of decentralization in which provincial lords gained semi-autonomy and eventually independence . The Bal\u0161i\u0107i wrestled the Zeta region in 1356-62 , when they removed the two rulers in Upper and Lower Zeta . Ruling as lords , they empowered themselves and over the decades became an important player in Balkan politics . Zeta was united into the Serbian Despotate in 1421 , after Bal\u0161a III abdicated and passed the rule to his uncle , Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 ( maternally a Nemanji\u0107 )"

Bosnia experienced de facto independence in the 13th and 14th centuries despite being a part of the Hungarian Crown Lands . Its difficult terrain and remoteness enabled the Bosnians to maneuver between their two powerful neighbors , Hungary and Serbia , usually managing to avoid subordination to either . Several capable rulers allowed Bosnia briefly to play the role of a regional power in the 14th century"
