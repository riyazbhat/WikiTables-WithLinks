Three teams advanced to the final after being named as hosts : D.C. United in 1997 , the New England Revolution in 2002 , and the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011 . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Since the 2012 edition , the match has been hosted by the finalist with the highest regular season standing . [ 4 ] Several teams with smaller or inadequate stadiums have also considered using larger American football stadiums to host the MLS Cup , but all post-2012 editions have been played at regular MLS venues . [ 24 ] The move towards a non-neutral venue was deemed a risk due to the cold November and December weather in some northern cities , as well as the lack of adequate stadiums for some teams . [ 25 ] The MLS Cup has been hosted in eleven stadiums across nine metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada . [ 26 ] Dignity Health Sports Park , previously named the Home Depot Center and StubHub Center , in Carson , California , has hosted the MLS Cup the most times of any venue , with six editions between 2003 and 2014 . [ 27 ] The largest attendance for an MLS Cup final was the 2018 edition at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta , Georgia , with 73,019 spectators ; [ 12 ] the smallest was in 2005 at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco , Texas , with only 21,193 spectators . [ 17 ] [ 28 ] Only three editions have been hosted outside the United States , all at BMO Field in Toronto , Canada . [ 17 ]",

  "intro": "The MLS Cup is the annual championship match of Major League Soccer (MLS), the top-level men's soccer league for the United States and Canada. The match marks the conclusion of the MLS Cup Playoffs, a four-round knockout competition contested by the top six teams from each of the league's two conferences. The playoffs tournament is organized by the league at the end of the regular season in a format similar to other professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, but unlike other soccer leagues. The league also awards the Supporters' Shield to teams that have the most points during the regular season. Both the MLS Cup champion and Supporters' Shield winner qualify for the CONCACAF Champions League, contested by the champions of CONCACAF leagues in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. First contested in 1996, the MLS Cup was originally hosted by a predetermined neutral site selected by the league before the regular season. Since the 2012 edition, the match has been hosted by the remaining team with the highest regular season standing. The final, originally contested in October, was moved to November and later December as the length of the regular season and playoffs were extended by the league. The playoffs originally allowed for lower-ranked seeds, known as wild cards, to be placed into different sides of the bracket regardless of their actual conference. As a result, several MLS Cups have featured two teams from the same conference. Seattle Sounders FC are the reigning cup-holders, having defeated Toronto FC in the 2019 final, the third edition in four years to feature the two teams. The Los Angeles Galaxy hold the record for most MLS Cup titles, having won five times in nine appearances."
