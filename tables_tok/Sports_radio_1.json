  "section_text": "In 2009 , Detroit 's `` 97.1 The Ticket '' WXYT-FM , thanks to the surprising time slot dominance of shows like Valenti and Foster , in addition to holding the play-by-play rights for the Detroit Tigers , Detroit Red Wings , Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons , became the USA 's only sports talk radio station to be the highest rated station in their market , according to Portable People Meter rankings . The station relocated to the FM dial in October 2007 after existing on the AM dial for seven years prior , replacing a Free FM `` hot talk '' station , WKRK . This ratings success has led to WXYT-FM billing itself as the country 's best sports station . WXYT-FM 's recent influence has led to CBS Radio installing sports radio stations on the FM dial in Dallas ( 105.3 The Fan ) , Boston ( 98.5 The Sports Hub ) , Pittsburgh ( 93.7 The Fan ) , Washington , DC ( 106.7 The Fan ) , Baltimore ( 105.7 The Fan ) and Cleveland ( 92.3 The Fan ) , in addition to simulcasting Philadelphia 's heritage 610 WIP onto the former WYSP . Other non-CBS stations have also migrated to the FM dial , most notably Clear Channel 's KFAN in Minneapolis , Greater Media 's WPEN in Pennsylvania and Dispatch Media 's WBNS-FM in Columbus , just to name a few . More recently , a number large number of listeners have begun to make internet radio the primary medium of choice . Major market leaders such as ESPN , NBC , CBS , Yahoo , and Fox have invested in the creation of their own proprietary sports apps for streaming radio distribution on Apple , Android , and Windows devices . Other independent market leaders such as Sports Radio America choose to stream their content through non proprietary apps including Live 365 and Tune In .

  "intro": "Sports radio (or sports talk radio) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events. A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal, sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers. Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play (live commentary) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming. Hosted by Bill Mazer, the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York's WNBC (AM). Soon after WNBC launched its program, in 1965 Seton Hall University's radio station, WSOU, started Hall Line, a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team's basketball program. Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season, Hall Line, which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York, is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area, and is believed to be the oldest in the nation. Enterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network, operating out of Avon, Connecticut, from New Year's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business. ER had two channels, one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play. ER's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling, New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy. Sports talk is available in local, network and syndicated forms, is available in multiple languages, and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks. In the United States, most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio, SB Nation Radio, Sports Byline USA, Fox Sports Radio, CBS Sports Radio, or NBC Sports Radio, while in the Spanish language, ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network. In contrast, Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand (such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio) but carry mostly local programming, with American-based shows filling in gaps."
