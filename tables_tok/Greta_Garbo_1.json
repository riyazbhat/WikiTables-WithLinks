  "intro": "Greta Garbo[a] (born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson;[b] 18 September 1905 - 15 April 1990) was a Swedish film actress during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on their list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema. Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling. Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, Torrent (1926). Garbos performance in Flesh and the Devil (1927), her third movie, made her an international star. Garbo's first talking film was Anna Christie (1930). MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline Garbo talks! That same year, she starred in Romance. For her performances in these films, she received the first of three Academy Award nominations for best actress. Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for his or her work in more than one film. In 1932, her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly selective about her roles."
