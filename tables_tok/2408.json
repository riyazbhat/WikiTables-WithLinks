  "section_text": "The early 1990s became the most unfortunate period . Football had just been experiencing its peak , with Red Star having just been European and World champions in 1991 , the league being highly competitive with intense domestic and even foreign media coverage and with crowded stadiums ; there was an outburst of numerous talented players , the golden generation that had won the youth world championship in 1987 was reaching its mature age , the national team easily qualified to the 1992 European Championship and was considered among some as favourite after the impressive display in the 1990 FIFA World Cup where ended eliminated in the quarter-finals in a penalty-shoutout against Argentina , and one-by-one all these advantages were turned apart . [ 4 ] Those dissatisfied with the regime and the malfunctioning state exploited the game as an explosive tool . Stadiums provided space where footballers and spectators could challenge the status quo of the regime , and served as the backdrop to violent clashes of incompatible nationalist visions . [ 4 ] With the death of Tito a decade earlier , the federation managed to stay united until the democratic elections were introduced , in which many of the politicians opted for forming parties with ethnical platforms , instead of ideological ones . This , along with the rise of nationalism , [ 8 ] inevitably led to the break-up of the Yugoslav federation . In football , the Belgrade-based YFA tried to keep it all together as the country was aiming to play in Sweden in the EURO 92 , however , one-by-one , initially Slovenia and Croatia , and then Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina , were declaring independence and forming their own Football Associations . Montenegro kept their union with Serbia , and the country was renamed into FR Yugoslavia , however , due to the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars and the involvement of the Federal Army in the conflict , the United Nations imposed economical sanctions to FR Yugoslavia which included the exclusion from all international sporting events , as well This led to the replacement in the EURO 92 of Yugoslavia by Denmark , which was second placed in the qualifying group and who will eventually win the tournament . For the national team , this was the start of a period of absence from international stage , which only ended in 1997 when the country was again allowed to participate in international competitions . This meant that an entire generation of players , some of which had become World champions , could not make their contribution to the national team during their most productive years . Similarly at club level , with Serbian teams having made high performances before the sanctions , their reality was completely changed , when in those years under sanctions they only played in domestic league with no practical results as their league qualification would not allow them to compete in continental competitions . This led to an extreme impoverishment of the clubs , with a mass exodus of players abroad . The strongest clubs , which had become a magnet for the best players in the region earlier , were now seeing their talents being obligated to move abroad in order to make an active career . All this created a situation where corruption and profiteering made their great entrance to local football Despite all , the domestic league managed to maintain certain level of quality and competitiveness . At the end of the 1990\u201391 season , clubs from Croatia and Slovenia withdrew and joined their own leagues . The following season the clubs from Bosnia and Macedonia made the same . The clubs from Montenegro stayed in the league system , along with FK Borac Banja Luka , which , because of the Bosnian War , had moved its team to Serbia . The league system was kept similar , although during some seasons a formula of first and second leagues divided each in two groups ( A and B each with 10 teams ) was introduced During this period , Red Star , who lost most of its players from the generation that won the European and Intercontinental Cups , also lost its domestic dominance to their main historic rivals , Partizan . By the mid-1990s the local mafia , who had become increasingly involved in local football , saw their peak when FK Obili\u0107 , owned and financed by one of mafia\u00b4s lords Arkan , started climbing successively in the league system , and won the national championship in 1998 . A year later , a new low-point in Serbian football came , when in March 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began , which interrupted the 1998-99 season which was abandoned and not retaken , as the War lasted for almost 3 months At the beginning of the new millennium domestic football started experiencing slowly a revival , with new generations of players being formed inspired by the now veterans which had , despite all , impressive careers . At club level , Partizan reached the UEFA Champions League group stage in 2003\u201304 season . They managed to have good European performances on several seasons , and had reach the group stages of the UEFA Cup on several occasions . Domestically , this period was marked by the intense rivalry between Partizan and Red Star , the Eternal derby , which became the highlight of Serbian club football Clubs were forming quality players , although the main problem was the increasingly shorter period of time the players remained in Serbia . The success of youth national teams gave some hope , however , it also turned the attention of managers towards ever younger players . The importing of talents from the region has been kept active since the Yugoslav period , and by the mid-2000s there has also been an increase of imports from all 5 continents . However , they had been hardly enough to compensate the export of domestic talents which had started in larger scale during the war and sanctions period . Unfortunately , since the stabilization of the political situation , the export of quality players has not diminished as the war period had turned it into a particularly attractive and profitable business for managers and others involved , who simply kept , and even further developed , this lucrative activity",
