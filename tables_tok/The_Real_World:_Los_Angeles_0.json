        "Beth is a graduate of Ohio University , where she studied film , television and radio production . She is an avid fan of the entertainment industry , and is in Los Angeles to pursue her career , to meet new people , and challenge herself . She works as a production assistant , in a casting office , and in craft services , but hopes one day to be a producer , director and actor . The death of her father , to whom she was much closer than her mother , was the hardest thing she ever experienced , and has still not been to his grave . She also has a sister , though her mother did not speak to her for a considerable time when Beth was in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend , who continues to call her demanding to see her . Her mother , Eugenia , a Polish-American radio host for WERE ( 1300 AM ) , works constantly , even doing shows on Christmas , and does not express her feelings often , which is why Beth feels they are not that close , even though she loves her mother very much . Beth discusses this when her mother visits the house in Episode 19 . According to MTV , her friends describe her as a drama queen whose life is like a soap opera . The rest of the cast affirms this label , including Dominic , who characterizes her as animated , and Aaron , who calls her a psycho . She eventually grows close to Jon and Tami , forming a trio by the cast trip to Mexico . Though Tami thinks Beth is the cast member most ready to settle down , Beth says that she has not had sex in a long time , because finding a suitable man in Los Angeles is difficult . Glen , however , develops an intense animosity toward Beth by Episodes 18 and 19 , seeing her as selfish , and a mess , leading the two to attempt a dialogue in the latter episode",

  "intro": "The Real World: California (retrospectively referred to as The Real World: Los Angeles, to distinguish it from subsequent installments of the series) is the second season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months, as the cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the first season of The Real World to be filmed in the Pacific States region of the United States, specifically in California. The season featured a total of nine cast members over the course of the season, as one cast member was evicted and replaced, and another was replaced when she got married. The Real World expanded from 13 to 21 episodes with this season. Production for the season started from February to June 1993. This is the first of two seasons to be filmed in Los Angeles. In 2008, filming of the twentieth season again took place in Los Angeles, this time in the district of Hollywood. The season, which documented 22 weeks of the cast's interactions, began with two cast members being flown to Nashville and then spending ten days driving cross country to their Venice Beach house in a Winnebago, picking up a third cast member in Owensboro, Kentucky along the way."
