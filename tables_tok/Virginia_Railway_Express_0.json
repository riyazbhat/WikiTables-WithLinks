  "intro": "The Virginia Railway Express (VRE) (reporting mark VREX) is a commuter rail service that connects the outer suburbs of Northern Virginia to Union Station in Washington, D.C., via two lines during peak hours only: the Fredericksburg Line from Fredericksburg, Virginia, and the Manassas Line from Broad Run station in Bristow, Virginia. Service to Manassas began on June 22, 1992; the Fredericksburg service started on July 20, 1992. VRE is owned by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission and the Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission. The NVTC and PRTC are governmental entities that were created by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Local governments (such as counties and cities) within each commission's geographic area are members of each commission. The service will undergo expansion as the result of a December 19, 2019, deal brokered between Virginia governor Ralph Northam and rail company CSX Transportation."
