        "Buckton Castle is on Buckton Hill near Carrbrook , overlooking the Tame Valley . Its location possibly allowed the castle to guard the valley . It was probably by the earls of Chester in the 12th century , and was first referred to in 1360 , by which time it was ruinous . It was constructed with a stone curtain wall and is surrounded by a ditch 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide and 6 metres ( 20 ft ) deep ; the site covers an area of 730 square metres ( 0.18 acres ) . The site has been damaged by 18th-century treasure hunters and is close to Buckton Vale Quarry",

        "The castle is on a slope overlooking the River Irwell in the centre of modern Bury . It is a fortified manor house constructed from stone and was built for Sir Thomas Pilkington . The castle may have replaced an earlier house on the site , surrounded by a moat . Excavation of known remains has revealed foundation walls 180 metres ( 590 ft ) by 82 metres ( 269 ft ) and a keep or tower 25 metres ( 82 ft ) by 19 metres ( 62 ft ) . Bury Castle was razed to the ground after the Wars of the Roses when Thomas Pilkington had his land confiscated . The remains , previously buried , have been excavated for public view , forming the centre piece of Castle Square in the town centre",

  "intro": "There are nine castles in Greater Manchester, a metropolitan county in North West England. They consist of four motte-and-baileys, three fortified manor houses, an enclosure castle, and a possible shell keep. A motte-and-bailey castle has two elements, the motte is an artificial conical mound with a wooden stockade and stronghold on top, usually a stone keep or tower. A bailey is a defended enclosure below the motte, surrounded by a ditch. Motte-and-bailey castles were the most common type of castle in England following the Norman Conquest. A shell keep was a motte with a stone wall rather than a wooden stockade on top; there would have been no tower within the walls. Four of Greater Manchester's castles are scheduled monuments: Buckton, Bury, Radcliffe Tower, and Watch Hill. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. The purpose of a castle was not simply militaristic, but was also considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to barons who had rebelled against Henry II, and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected."
