The remaining six would require new services to be integrated into the existing capacity on the main lines they connect to Three of the schemes also link currently separate parts of the network , Leicester \u2013 Burton , Washington ( Leamside Line ) and Brownhills ( Walsall \u2013 Lichfield line ) , bringing possible additional benefits for freight traffic and provision of diversionary routes The 14 schemes with a BCR greater than 1 were as follows :",
