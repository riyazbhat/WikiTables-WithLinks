The Heritage Railways involved include the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway and the East Lancashire Railway . Eight of these 14 schemes involve the extension or diversion of existing passenger services . The remaining six would require new services to be integrated into the existing capacity on the main lines they connect to . Three of the schemes also link currently separate parts of the network , Leicester \u2013 Burton , Washington ( Leamside Line ) and Brownhills ( Walsall \u2013 Lichfield line ) , bringing possible additional benefits for freight traffic and provision of diversionary routes .

  "uid": "Connecting_Communities:_Expanding_Access_to_the_Rail_Network_0",
  "intro": "Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network is a 2009 report by the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) identifying potential expansion of the National Rail passenger railway network in England, primarily through the construction or re-opening of railway lines for passenger services, and the construction or re-opening of up to 40 new passenger railway stations. The report was published on 15 June 2009, and identified 14 commercially viable schemes involving new passenger lines, requiring the definite re-opening or construction of at least 30 new stations. These schemes would be using a mixture of historically closed lines, recently closed or currently operating freight only lines, or sharing heritage railway tracks with permission from their owners. The report also identified seven commercially viable sites for new Park and Ride stations (a.k.a. Parkway stations) to be built on existing lines. The report also identified seven potential new passenger 'link lines' on the existing rail network, opening up new passenger routes but without new stations. The report covered relatively low cost short term localised schemes, with lead times from initiation to completion ranging from 2 years 9 months to 6 years, complementing larger schemes already in place for completion past 2014. For the schemes to reach completion, the proposals would need to be taken forward by the respective local and regional governments, Network Rail (the infrastructure owner) and the Department for Transport. The schemes would complement development to the national rail network already undertaken since 1995, comprising the completion of 27 new lines (totalling 199 track miles) and 68 stations, with 65 new station sites identified by Network Rail or government for possible construction. However the great majority of these new lines and stations are in Scotland, Wales and London. The report examine schemes in England only, due to fact rail development in Scotland and Wales was already being organised by Transport Scotland and the Welsh Assembly."
