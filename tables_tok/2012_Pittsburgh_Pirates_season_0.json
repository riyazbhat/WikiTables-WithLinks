  "intro": "The 2012 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the franchise's 126th season as a member of the National League, their 131st season overall, and their 12th season at PNC Park. Despite being 67-54 on August 19, the Pirates finished the season 79-83. This set a record for the longest losing season streak in all of North American professional sports history at 20. The Pirates played just six extra inning games during the season, the fewest of any MLB team in 2012."
