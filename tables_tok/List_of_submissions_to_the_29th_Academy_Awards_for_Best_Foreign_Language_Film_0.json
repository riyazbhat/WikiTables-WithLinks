  "intro": "In 1956, the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) asked individual countries to submit their best films of the year for the inaugural Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In previous years, the Foreign Language Oscar was not a regular award, and there were no nominees - a winner was simply announced at the Oscar ceremony. Eight countries from Western Europe and East Asia submitted films for consideration for the first award, and five of these were selected as Oscar nominees. The inaugural winner, Italy's La Strada, was announced at the Oscar ceremony, which took place on March 27, 1957."
