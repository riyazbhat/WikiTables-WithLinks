Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations , Gundersen was fired . According to The New York Times , for three years , Gundersen was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night and he became concerned about his family 's safety . Gundersen believes he was blacklisted , harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right . NES filed a $ 1.5 million defamation lawsuit against him that was settled out-of-court . A U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission report concluded that there had been irregularities at NES , and the Office of the Inspector General reported that the NRC had violated its own regulations by sending business to NES",

        "Nuclear power whistleblower George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant , relating to reactor refueling procedures , in 1996 . The unsafe procedures meant that spent fuel rod pools at Unit 1 had the potential to boil , possibly releasing radioactive steam . Galatis eventually took his concerns to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , to find that they had known about the unsafe procedures for years . As a result of going to the NRC , Galatis experienced subtle forms of harassment , retaliation , and intimidation . The NRC Office of Inspector General investigated this episode and essentially agreed with Galatis in Case Number 95-771 , the report of which tells the whole story . George Galatis was the subject of a Time magazine cover story on March 4 , 1996 . Millstone 1 was permanently closed in July 1998",

Olivieri informed both the research ethics board that was monitoring the study and Apotex , the drug maker . The research ethics board instructed Olivieri to inform participants about her concerns . Apotex responded by noting that Olivieri had signed a confidentiality agreement as part of the drug trial and that informing participants about her concerns , the validity of which Apotex disputed , would violate that confidentiality agreement . Apotex threatened to vigorously pursue all legal remedies against her if she disclosed her conclusions to patients . Olivieri disclosed her concerns to her patients and Apotex ended the portion of the study in which she was participating . In 1998 , the New England Journal of Medicine published her paper suggesting that deferiprone led to progressive hepatic fibrosis",
