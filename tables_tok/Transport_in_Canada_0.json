However , since the introduction of the policy only one , Iqaluit Airport , has been added and no airports have been removed despite dropping below 200,000 passengers . [ 18 ] The Government of Canada , with the exception of the three territorial capitals , retains ownership of these airports and leases them to local authorities . The next tier consists of 64 regional/local airports formerly owned by the federal government , most of which have now been transferred to other owners ( most often to municipalities ) .
