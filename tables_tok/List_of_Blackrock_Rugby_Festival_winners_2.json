  "intro": "This is a list of previous winners of the Blackrock Rugby Festival, which was established in 1983. Hosts St. Mary's School hold 10 Main Cup titles, the highest of any school in the tournament. The Main Cup had been competed for by all teams since 1983, but from 2000, it was decided that the top team of each group would qualify for the quarter-finals of the Main Cup, while the second and third-placed team of each group would qualify for the quarter-finals of the Plate and Bowl Cup respectively."
