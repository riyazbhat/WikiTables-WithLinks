SIT technique may be applied as part of an area-wide control ( integrated pest management ) approach of insects of medical , veterinary , and agricultural importance . It was in 1937 when Edward Knipling proposed using sterilization to control or eradicate insect pests after observation that screwworm fly males mate repeatedly while females mate only once . He then made the hypothesis that if large numbers of sterile males could repeatedly be released into wild populations , it would eventually eliminate population reproduction and lead to eradication .
