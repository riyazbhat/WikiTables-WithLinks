  "intro": "This is a list of every Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team quarterback and the years they participated on the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team. Georgia Tech quarterbacks have led Georgia Tech to 673 wins, 37 bowl games, and 4 National Championships. Two quarterbacks have received Heisman Trophy votes and one of the quarterbacks, Billy Lothridge, received votes in multiple years. Nine Georgia Tech quarterbacks have been taken in the National Football League draft since 1936. Including the NFL, Georgia Tech quarterbacks have also played professionally in the Arena Football League, Canadian Football League, World Football League, and American Football League. Three former Georgia Tech quarterbacks went on to be head coaches in Division I-A or professional football. Georgia Tech quarterbacks have played prominent roles in American society off the gridiron as well. Froggie Morrison, the starting quarterback for the 222-0 game, served in World War I after graduating in 1916. Pat McHugh graduated in 1942, fought in World War II, and returned in 1946 to be drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles. Eddie McAshan became the first African American to start at quarterback for a major Southeastern university during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. Four Georgia Tech quarterbacks transferred from other universities and won starting jobs at Georgia Tech. Of the four, two men transferred from archrival University of Georgia and ironically defeated the Bulldogs three times in four meetings including the very first contest of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate."
