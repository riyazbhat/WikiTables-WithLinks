  "intro": "The 2012 Meath Senior Football Championship is the 120th edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Meath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 17 teams, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. Summerhill were the defending champions after they defeated Dunshaughlin in the previous years final. Moynalvey were promoted after claiming the 2011 Meath Intermediate Football Championship title, their first year in the senior grade since being relegated in 2000 and only their 2nd ever period as a senior club. The draw for the group stages of the championship was made at \u00c1ras Tailteann on 13 February 2012, with the games commencing on the weekend of 15 April 2012. On 28 October 2012, Navan O'Mahonys claimed their 18th senior championship title when they defeated Wolfe Tones 1-11 to 0-7. Shane Gillespie was named as Man-of-the-Match and captain Marcus Brennan raised the Keegan Cup for O'Mahonys."
