[ 1 ] A total of 778 detainees have been held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps , in Cuba since the camps opened on January 11 , 2002 . The camp population peaked in 2004 at approximately 660 . Hundreds of detainees were released without charges Following the United States Supreme Court 's ruling in Rasul v. Bush ( 2004 ) that detainees had the right under habeas corpus to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal , transfers to Guantanamo decreased Nineteen `` high value detainees '' have been transferred by the CIA to Guantanamo since September 2006 , as the administration restricted their access to outside counsel and courts under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 . This provision of the act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush ( 2008 ) , which said detainees had the right of access to federal courts for habeas corpus challenges . As of February 24 , 2010 , the camp population stood at 188 .
