  "section_title": "Cultivars -- Capsicum annuum",
  "section_text": "Main article : Capsicum annuum Capsicum annuum , native from southern North America through Central America to South America , has been cultivated worldwide for over 400 years . [ 10 ] Its fruit forms are varied , from large to small , sweet to sour , and very hot/pungent to bland . Despite being a single species , C. annuum has many forms , with a variety of names , even in the same language . Official names aside , in American English , any variety lacking heat is colloquially known as a sweet pepper , and those sweet peppers that have a blocky-shape are referred to as bell peppers . A variety that produces capsaicin is colloquially known as a hot pepper or chili pepper . In British English , the sweet varieties are called `` peppers '' [ 11 ] and the hot varieties `` chillies '' , [ 12 ] whereas in Australian English , the name `` capsicum '' is commonly used for bell peppers exclusively and `` chilli '' is often used to encompass the hotter varieties The plant is a tender perennial subshrub , with a densely branched stem . The plant reaches 0.5\u20131.5 m ( 20\u201359 in ) . Single white flowers develop into the fruit , which is typically green when unripe , but may lack chlorophyll causing a white color . Ripening fruits usually change to red , although some varieties may ripen to yellow , orange , peach , brown , or purple . The species are grown in temperate climates as an annual , but they are especially productive in warm and dry climates . [ 13 ]",
