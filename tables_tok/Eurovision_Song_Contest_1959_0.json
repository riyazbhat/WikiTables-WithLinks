  "intro": "The Eurovision Song Contest 1959 was the fourth edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Cannes, France, following Andr\u00e9 Claveau's win at the 1958 contest in Hilversum, Netherlands with the song Dors, mon amour. It was the first time France hosted the event. The contest was held at Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s on Wednesday 11 March 1959, and was hosted by Jacqueline Joubert. Eleven countries participated in the contest. Monaco made its d\u00e9but this year, while Luxembourg decided to withdraw. The United Kingdom returned after their absence from the previous edition. The winner was the Netherlands with the song Een beetje, performed by Teddy Scholten, written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Dick Schallies. This was the Netherlands' second victory in the contest, following their win in 1957 - marking the first time a country had won more than once. Willy van Hemert also wrote the first Dutch winner that year."
