  "section_text": "Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements . Different designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort , cargo space , fuel economy , emissions control , energy security and endurance . Reduced drag and lower rolling resistance in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the ( zero cargo ) power-to-weight ratio . This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle . Energy security considerations can trade off power ( typically decreased ) and weight ( typically increased ) , and therefore power-to-weight ratio , for fuel flexibility or drive-train hybridisation . Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as hot hatches and sports-utility vehicles reconfigure power ( typically increased ) and weight to provide the perception of sports car like performance or for other psychological benefit . A locomotive generally must be very heavy in order to develop enough adhesion on the rails to start a train . As the coefficient of friction between steel wheels and rails seldom exceeds 0.25 in most cases , improving a locomotive 's power-to-weight ratio is often counterproductive . However , the choice of power transmission system , such as variable-frequency drive versus direct current drive , may support a higher power-to-weight ratio by better managing propulsion power . Notable low ratio [ edit ]",

  "intro": "Power-to-weight ratio (or specific power or power-to-mass ratio) is a calculation commonly applied to engines and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a vehicle as a whole, with the engine's power output being divided by the weight (or mass) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance. The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle."
