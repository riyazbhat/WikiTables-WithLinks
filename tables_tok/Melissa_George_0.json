A former national rollerskating champion and model, George began her acting career playing Angel Parrish on the Australian soap opera Home and Away (1993-96). After moving to the United States, George made her big-screen debut in 1998 in the neo-noir/science fiction film Dark City. She later appeared in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey (1999), David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001), Sugar & Spice (2001), and Down with Love (2003). In 2005, George transitioned into leading roles when she played Kathy Lutz in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She followed this with a succession of films in the thriller and horror genres, such as Derailed (2005), Turistas (2006), W\u0394Z (2007), 30 Days of Night (2007), Triangle (2009), A Lonely Place to Die (2011), and Felony (2013). On television, George has had recurring roles on Alias (2003-04), Grey's Anatomy (2008-09) and The Good Wife (2013-14), and a leading role on the NBC medical drama Heartbeat (2016). She received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Laura Hill on HBO's In Treatment (2008).
