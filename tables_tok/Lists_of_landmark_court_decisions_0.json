  "section_text": "Main articles : List of Supreme Court of Canada cases and List of Judicial Committees of the Privy Council cases There is no universally agreed-to list of `` leading decisions '' in Canada One indication , however , as to whether a case is widely regarded as being `` leading '' is its inclusion of the ruling in one or more of the series of compilations prepared over the years by various authors . One of the earlier examples is Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy 's Leading Cases in Canadian Constitutional Law , published in 1914 . More recently , Peter H. Russell and a changing list of collaborators have published a series of books , including : Leading Constitutional Decisions ( first published 1965 , with several later editions ) ; Federalism and the Charter : Leading Constitutional Decisions ( published in 1989 , co-edited by Russell , F.L . Morton and Rainer Knopff ) ; The Court and the Charter : Leading Cases ( published in 2008 , co-edited by Russell , Morton , Knopff , Thomas Bateman and Janet Hiebert ) ; and The Court and the Constitution : Leading Cases ( published in 2008 , co-edited by Russell , Morton , Knopff , Bateman and Hiebert ) Decisions in leading cases in Canada have usually been made by the Supreme Court of Canada . Prior to the abolition of appeals of Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s , most landmark decisions were made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London",
