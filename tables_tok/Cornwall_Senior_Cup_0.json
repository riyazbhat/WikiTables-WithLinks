It is a County Cup competition involving clubs from the South West Peninsula League, East Cornwall League and Cornwall Combination. As of the 2015-16 season, the competition is called the RGB Senior Cup for sponsorship reasons. The reigning champions are Bodmin Town, who defeated Godolphin Athletic in the 2016 final to win the cup for the fifth time in seven years. It was Godolphin's second successive defeat in the final."
