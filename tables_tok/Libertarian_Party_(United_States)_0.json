The first Libertarian presidential candidate , John Hospers , received one electoral vote in 1972 when Roger MacBride , a Virginia Republican faithless elector pledged to Richard Nixon , cast his ballot for the Libertarian ticket . His vote for Theodora ( `` Tonie '' ) Nathan as Vice President was the first electoral college vote ever to be cast for a woman in a United States presidential election . [ 51 ] MacBride became the Libertarian nominee himself in 1976 . This was the last time that the Libertarian Party won an electoral vote until 44 years later , in the 2016 presidential election , when Texas Republican faithless elector Bill Greene , who was pledged to cast his vote for Donald Trump , instead cast his vote for Libertarian Party member and former congressman Ron Paul for President .

  "intro": "The Libertarian Party (LP) is a political party in the United States that promotes civil liberties, non-interventionism, laissez-faire capitalism, and limiting the size and scope of government. The party was conceived in August 1971 at meetings in the home of David F. Nolan in Westminster, Colorado, and was officially formed on December 11, 1971 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The founding of the party was prompted in part due to concerns about the Nixon administration, the Vietnam War, conscription, and the introduction of fiat money. The party generally promotes a classical liberal platform, in contrast to the Democratic Party's modern liberalism and progressivism and the Republican Party's conservatism. Gary Johnson, the party's presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, states that the Libertarian Party is more culturally liberal than Democrats, and more fiscally conservative than Republicans. Current fiscal policy positions include lowering taxes, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), decreasing the national debt, allowing people to opt out of Social Security and eliminating the welfare state, in part by utilizing private charities. Current cultural policy positions include ending the prohibition of illegal drugs, advocating criminal justice reform, supporting same-sex marriage, ending capital punishment and supporting gun ownership rights. While it is currently the third largest political party in the United States by voter registration, it currently has no members in Congress, or governorships, and over the past decade, has had fewer than 10 members elected to state legislatures or other state office. There are 511,277 voters (0.46% of total electorate) registered as Libertarian in the 31 states that report Libertarian registration statistics and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian Party was the party under which the first electoral vote was cast for a woman (Tonie Nathan) for Vice President in the 1972 United States presidential election due to a faithless elector."
