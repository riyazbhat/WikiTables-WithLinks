  "section_text": "Historically AFL broadcasts in other countries have varied In the 1980s , VFL matches were shown in the United States on ESPN for some time . In the early 1990s , Prime Network , an American regional sports network unrelated to the Australian regional television network , aired Seven 's weekly highlight show as well as the Grand Final . Some other English speaking countries have shown the game , however it has been since 2008 that channels in other countries began televising matches . From 1998 to 2006 games were broadcast in the United States by the Fox Sports World network . [ 75 ] In 2007 , after the record domestic television rights deal , the AFL secured an additional bonus : greater international television rights and increase exposure to overseas markets , including a five-year deal with Setanta Sports and new deals with other overseas pay-TV networks . The deal ended early in 2009 when Setanta stopped broadcasting into Great Britain . ESPN again took up the contract . [ 76 ] The following countries are ranked by the approximate extent of their current television coverage ( and whether it is free to air ) :",
