  "intro": "Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC is an American professional soccer team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1998 and beginning play in 1999, the club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. Since 2013, the Riverhounds have played their home games at the 5,000-seat Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square. Their current head coach is Bob Lilley. Saint Lucian international David Flavius currently holds the club records for most appearances and goals which he set over his eight seasons with the Riverhounds between 1999 and 2006. In June 2017, the Riverhounds entered into a developmental partnership with the Ocean City Nor'easters of the Premier Development League, running through the 2018 season. In 2013, the Riverhounds organization announced its intentions to join Major League Soccer by 2023 (however, as of 2019, the MLS has not listed Pittsburgh in a list of possible expansion cities). Highmark Stadium initially seated 3,500 spectators, though the stadium is designed to be capable of being expanded to 18,500."
