Taken hostage were 10 tourists from Europe and the Middle East and 11 Malaysian resort workers , 19 non-Filipino nationals in total . The hostages were taken to an Abu Sayyaf base in Jolo , Sulu . During the hostage taking , Abu Sayyaf issued various demands for the release of several prisoners , including 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef , $ 2.4 million and a complete withdrawal of government troops from the area around Jolo where the hostages were being held . The Philippine army launched a major offensive on 16 September 2000 , rescuing all remaining hostages , except Filipino dive instructor Roland Ullah . Ullah was eventually freed in 2003",
