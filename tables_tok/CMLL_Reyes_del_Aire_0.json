  "intro": "The Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) has traditionally held an annual Reyes del Aire (Spanish for Kings of the Air) tournament since 2005. There was no tournament in 2010 and both 2007 and 2012 saw two Reyes del Aire tournaments. The tournament includes a varying number of wrestlers, competing in a Torneo cibernetico match, essentially a multi-man elimination match with the last competitor remaining is declared that year's Rey del Aire and is given a trophy. CMLL holds a similar tournament for their Mini-Estrella division called Peque\u00f1os Reyes del Aire (Little Kings of the Air). Being a professional wrestling tournament, it is not won legitimately; it is instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that are kept secret from the general public. The tournament normally features low and mid-card wrestlers who work a High flying style, hence the name Kings of the Air but has at times featured more wrestlers closer to the main event or closer to the low card positions. The winner gets a trophy, but there is no other tangible reward for winning the match other than the increased recognition, they are not awarded with a championship match or anything else of that nature. There have been nine tournaments so far, with three wrestlers winning more than one tournament; Volador Jr. has won three tournaments in total while \u00c1ngel de Oro and Valiente has won two. \u00c1ngel de Oro is the only wrestler to win consecutive tournaments as he won both the 2011 and the first 2012 Reyes del Aire tournaments. A total of 67 luchadors have appeared in the 13 tournaments so far, with Valiente having appeared in nine out of those, and Virus and Stuka Jr., each appearing in six in total. Five men have participated under two different ring identities, in some cases without the previous identity being acknowledged. Niebla Roja has appeared both under that name and his previous identity \u00c1ngel de Plata."
