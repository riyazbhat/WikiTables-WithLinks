This marked the first time that more than one venue would be used for the football tournament , which has been the case ever since . [ citation needed ] Stockholm Olympic Stadium served as one of the equestrian venues for the 1956 Summer Olympics . R\u00e5sunda Stadium served as a venue for the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women 's World Cup . In the initial bid document it was identified that a new stadium would be needed , initially envisaged as being located in the \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds . In order to save funds , it was expected that only one of the stadium 's stands would be permanent , with the other three made of wood and dismantled following the Games . The cost of that stadium was estimated at 235,000 Kronor . [ 3 ] Arrangements were made with the individual national committees to provide the use of \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds and Traneberg . [ 13 ] The cycling road race was held around M\u00e4laren , the third largest lake in Sweden . [ 14 ] The water events , including the swimming and the rowing , were held at Djurg\u00e5rdsbrunnsviken , where a stadium was built . Kakn\u00e4s was already used as a shooting range , but alterations were needed to accommodate shooting events . Although it was not used as the Olympic stadium as originally intended , \u00d6stermalm hosted the lawn tennis and fencing competitions after a tennis pavilion was moved there from another location . [ 15 ] Five other locations were considered in addition to the \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds to locate the Olympic Stadium . The Stockholm Olympic Stadium was built on the site of the former Stockholm Athletic Grounds in order to retain the other locations for other uses during the Games . By placing it to the north of the city , the Olympic Stadium was within the immediate vicinity of other pre-existing sporting venues . Initial funding was given to the sum of 400,000 Kr for a timber stadium but Torben Grut , [ 16 ] the architect , also drew up alternative plans for a stone stadium . Following discussions with the Swedish Central Association for the Application of Athletics , it was decided that the stone version should be built , and further funds were made available through a national lottery once guarantees were made that no further funding was to be asked for in order to build the stadium . [ 17 ] However it was found that the original estimate for the stone stadium would still be too expensive , and the plans were once more modified in order to simplify the design and reduce costs . An agreement was entered into with a contractor on 2 November 1910 that it would be transferred complete by 25 May 1912 . [ 18 ]",
