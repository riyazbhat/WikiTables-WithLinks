Six parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly were each invited to send one representative .

[ 23 ] The remaining places , 29 in the event , were divided between the Oireachtas groups so as to be `` impartially representative of the Houses '' . [ 5 ] Each Oireachtas group is represented , roughly proportional to their total numbers in both houses ( D\u00e1il and Seanad ) , including the D\u00e1il technical group and the Seanad independent group .

  "intro": "The Convention on the Constitution (Irish: An Coinbhinsi\u00fan ar an mBunreacht) was established in Ireland in 2012 to discuss proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland. More commonly called simply the Constitutional Convention, it met for the first time 1 December 2012 and sat until 31 March 2014. It had 100 members: a chairman; 29 members of the Oireachtas (parliament); four representatives of Northern Ireland political parties; and 66 randomly selected citizens of Ireland. The Convention was mandated to consider eight specified issues, and also selected two others to discuss. The government was not obliged to proceed with any amendment proposal, but committed to respond formally to each recommendation and debate it in the Oireachtas. As of December 2018[update], the government had formally responded to all nine of the Convention's reports, and put three of its proposals to referendum. Two of those referendums took place on 22 May 2015: to mandate legal same-sex marriage and to reduce the age of eligibility for the presidency from 35 to 21. The former was accepted, and the latter rejected. A third referendum was passed on 26 October 2018 to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution."
