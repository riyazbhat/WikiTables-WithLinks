  "section_text": "Main article : 29th Canadian Ministry The Liberal Party of Canada won the federal election of October 19 , 2015 with a majority of seats in the House of Commons . The Cabinet was sworn-in on November 4 , with Justin Trudeau appointed as prime minister The swearing in of the new Cabinet also marked the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada 's history , where an equal number of female and male Ministers were appointed . [ 35 ] This was reflected in the fifteen women and fifteen men who were sworn into Cabinet on November 4 , for a total of thirty-one members , including the Prime Minister himself . Trudeau has continued to maintain a gender-balanced cabinet throughout several cabinet shuffles in his mandate , and the addition of five new ministerial positions Initially , five members of Cabinet were appointed by orders-in-council on November 4 as ministers of state , but styled without the traditional of state in their titles . These were the Ministers of Science , [ 36 ] Small Business and Tourism , [ 37 ] Sport and Persons with Disabilities , [ 38 ] Status of Women , [ 39 ] and La Francophonie . [ 40 ] ( However , the new Minister of La Francophonie was , at the same time , appointed Minister of International Development . ) Ministers of state had previously represented a second order within the Cabinet ( determined by a lower salary as defined by the Salaries Act , [ 41 ] despite the Ministries and Ministers of State Act giving them full authority for any government function delegated to them . [ 42 ] However , after details of the aforementioned orders-in-council were published , the new cabinet stated its intent for there to `` be no levels of cabinet members '' and it would table in parliament amendments to the salary statutes , but also that the new ministers would continue to work with the existing departments rather than forming new ones . [ 43 ] On July 18 , 2018 Trudeau reshuffled his cabinet . This included adding 5 new ministry positions expanding the previous size of cabinet from 30 to 35 . [ 44 ] Ministers are listed according to the Canadian order of precedence : [ 45 ]",
