  "intro": "This page is a list of film adaptations of video games. These include local, international, direct-to-video and TV releases, and (in certain cases) online releases. They include their scores on Rotten Tomatoes, the region in which they were released (for foreign adaptations), approximate budget, their approximate box office revenue (for theatrical releases), distributor of the film, and the publisher of the original game at the time the film was made (this means that publishers may change between two adaptations of the same game or game series, such as Mortal Kombat). Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as Tron or WarGames). Films based on video games have often received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes's 2019 list titled Video Game Movies Ranked Worst to Best included only 3 films that received a fresh Tomatometer rating. [a]"
