  "intro": "The 2013 Scottish Women's Premier League was the twelfth season of the Scottish Women's Premier League, the highest division of women's football in Scotland since its inception in 2002. The competition started on 17 March 2013. A total of twelve teams are contested the league. Glasgow City were the reigning champions. Buchan Ladies and Kilwinning SC Ladies were promoted from the SWFL First Division after finishing 3rd and 4th respectively and both appeared in the Premier League for the first time. First Division champions Hibernian Reserves and runners-up Celtic Reserves were unable to be promoted as league rules stipulate each club may field only one team in the Premier League. The SWPL continued in the format adopted in 2012. The 12 clubs faced each other once (11 games per club), after which the league split into top six and bottom six sections based on league position. Each club then played home and away against clubs in their respective sections to give a total of 21 games. Glasgow City won their seventh consecutive championship title on 29 September 2013."
