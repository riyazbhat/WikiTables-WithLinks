  "intro": "This list of Irish-language given names shows Irish language (as Gaeilge) given names and Anglicized or Latinized forms, with English equivalents. Some English-language names derive directly from the Irish - Kathleen = Caitl\u00edn, Owen = Eoghan. Some Irish-language names derive or are adapted from the English-language - \u00c9amon = Edmund or Edward. Some Irish-language names have direct English equivalents deriving from a common name in Ireland. M\u00e1ire, Maura and Mary derive from the French Marie and the Hebrew Mary. Maureen = M\u00e1ir\u00edn, a diminutive. Some Irish names have [apparent] equivalents in other languages but are not etymologically related. \u00c1ine (meaning brightness or radiance) is accepted as Anna and Anne (\u00c1ine was the name of an Irish Celtic goddess). Some Irish given names may have no equivalent in English (being simply spelt phonetically in an Anglo-Roman way.) During the Irish revival, some Irish names which had fallen out of use were revived. Some names are recent creations - such as the now-common female name Saoirse, which is actually the Irish word for freedom, and Aisling, meaning vision, dream. Traditionally and to this day, suffixes may be used to qualify which generation is being referred to e.g., Ruaidhr\u00ed M\u00f3r and Domhnall \u00d3g are readily understood suffixes."
