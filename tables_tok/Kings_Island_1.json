  "section_title": "Areas and attractions -- Coney Mall",
  "section_text": "When Kings Island first opened in 1972 , a section of the park was dedicated to its predecessor , Coney Island . The area was constructed to resemble the former park 's carnival-style layout and featured many of its flat rides which were relocated , including Monster , Scrambler , and Dodgem . One of the flagship attractions during the park 's inaugural year , The Racer , was located in this section . [ 61 ] In addition to rides , some of Coney Island 's famous Ginkgo trees were transplanted , lining the middle of the walkway . [ 7 ] Originally called Coney Island , the area was later renamed Old Coney in 1980 and again to its present name Coney Mall in 1986 . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The area also features game booths , arcades and concession stands reminiscent of state fairs and traveling carnivals from the early twentieth century . [ 66 ] In 1975 , Zodiac debuted in the Coney Island mall , which was billed as a `` spinning , climbing double ferris wheel '' . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Brokered by Intamin and manufactured by Waagner-Biro , the three-minute ride featured twelve gondolas on each of the two wheels which were mounted to a long , hydraulic arm . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] It closed in 1986 and reopened at Wonderland Sydney in 1989 . [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] In the 1980s , the area saw the additions of Skylab , Zephyr , and Vortex , a six-inversion looping roller coaster that briefly held a world record for most inversions . [ 7 ] [ 72 ] Following Paramount 's acquisition of the park in 1992 , Coney Mall was further expanded in 1994 with Days of Thunder , a motion simulator ride in the new Action Theater attraction , and in 1996 with Flight of Fear , the world 's first launched roller coaster to feature a linear induction motor ( LIM ) . [ 7 ] [ 72 ] In 2005 , one of the last Paramount-themed attractions to open at the park , The Italian Job : Stunt Track ( now known as Backlot Stunt Coaster ) , was unveiled . [ 7 ] [ 73 ] The roller coaster replaced the antique car ride Les Taxis . [ 74 ] Firehawk , a flying roller coaster previously known as X-Flight at Geauga Lake , was relocated to Kings Island next to Flight of Fear in 2007 . [ 72 ] The area housing both roller coasters became known as X-Base , a sub-section within Coney Mall that took on its own theme . [ 75 ] The most recent addition to Coney Mall was WindSeeker , added in 2011 . The 301-foot-tall ( 92 m ) , three-minute swing ride features 32 , two-person carriages that spin around a central tower up to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km/h ) . [ 76 ] Kings Mill Antique Autos , a new antique cars ride , debuted in 2019 . [ 77 ] Kings Island announced in September 2019 that Vortex would be closing permanently after 33 years of operation on October 27 , 2019 . [ 78 ] [ 79 ]",
