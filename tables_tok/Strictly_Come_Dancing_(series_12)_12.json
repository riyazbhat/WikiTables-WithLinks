  "intro": "Strictly Come Dancing returned for its twelfth series beginning from 7 September 2014 with a launch show, with the live shows starting on 26 and 27 September. Tess Daly returned to present the main show on BBC One alongside Claudia Winkleman, who was promoted to co-presenter in addition to the results show after Sir Bruce Forsyth decided to leave the show (He made his final regular appearance on this series' launch show) after the eleventh series; however, Forsyth continued to host the Christmas and Children in Need specials. Zo\u00eb Ball returned as presenter of spin-off show on BBC Two. Judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell also returned. In the third week entertainer Donny Osmond joined the four regular judges, making the maximum score that week 50 points. The shows from 1 to 16 November were hosted by Daly and Zo\u00eb Ball, after one of Winkleman's children was involved in an accident. Winkleman returned to co-host the show on 22 November. The series was won by Caroline Flack and Pasha Kovalev on 20 December. She became the first celebrity to score the maximum 40 from the judges in all three of her dances in the final, and second to get the highest scores possible in the final after Lisa Snowdon did in series 6, and also set the record for the longest consecutive run of 40 marks, with four, since her second dance in the semi-final had also scored 40, breaking Snowdon's record of three. Kovalev also became the second strictly professional to reach the finals three times, after Brendan Cole."
