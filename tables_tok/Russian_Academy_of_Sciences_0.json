  "section_text": "Shortly after the October Revolution , in December 1917 , Sergey Fedorovich Oldenburg , a leading ethnographer and political activist in the Kadet party , met with Vladimir Lenin to discuss the future of the Academy . They agreed that the expertise of the Academy would be applied to addressing questions of state construction , while in return the Soviet government would give the Academy financial and political support The most important activities of the Academy in the 1920s included an investigation of the large Kursk Magnetic Anomaly , of the minerals in the Kola Peninsula , and participation in the GOELRO plan targeted electrification of the whole country . In these years , many research institutions were established , and the number of scientists became four times larger than in 1917 . In 1925 the Soviet government recognized the Russian Academy of Sciences as the `` highest all-Union scientific institution '' and renamed it the Academy of Sciences of the USSR In 1934 , the Academy headquarters moved from Leningrad to the capital , Moscow The Stalin years are marked with a rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union for which a great deal of research , mainly in the technical fields , has been done . However , on the other hand , in these very times , many scientists underwent repressions from ideological reasons In the years of the Second World War , the Soviet Academy of Sciences made a big contribution to a development of modern weapons \u2013 tanks ( new series of T-34 ) , airplanes , degaussing the ships ( for protection against the naval mines ) etc . \u2013 and therefore to victory of the USSR over the Nazi Germany . During and after the war , the Academy was involved in the Soviet atomic bomb project ; due to its success and other achievements in military techniques , the USSR became one of the superpowers in the Cold War era At the end of the 1940s , the Academy consisted of eight divisions ( Physico-Mathematical Science , Chemical Sciences , Geological-Geographical Sciences , Biological Science , Technical Science , History and Philosophy , Economics and Law , Literature and Languages ) ; three committees ( one for coordinating the scientific work of the Academies of the Republics , one for scientific and technical propaganda , and one for editorial and publications ) , two commissions ( for publishing popular scientific literature , and for museums and archives ) , a laboratory for scientific photography and cinematography and Academy of Science Press departments external to the divisions . [ 18 ] The Academy of Sciences of the USSR helped to establish national Academies of Sciences in all Soviet republics ( with the exception of the Russian SFSR ) , in many cases delegating prominent scientists to live and work in other republics . In the case of the Ukraine , its academy was formed by the local Ukrainian scientists and prior to occupation of the Ukrainian People 's Republic by Bolsheviks . These academies were :",
