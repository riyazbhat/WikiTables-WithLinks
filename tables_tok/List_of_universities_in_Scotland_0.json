  "section_text": " Kings College , University of Aberdeen in 2013 There are fifteen universities based in Scotland , the Open University , and three other institutions of higher education . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The first university in Scotland was St John 's College , St Andrews , founded in 1418 . [ 3 ] St Salvator 's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450 . The other great bishoprics followed , with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and King 's College , Aberdeen in 1495 . [ 4 ] St Leonard 's College was founded in Aberdeen in 1511 and St John 's College was re-founded in 1538 as St Mary 's College , St Andrews . [ 5 ] Public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s would eventually become the University of Edinburgh in 1582 . [ 6 ] In 1641 , the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of Charles I ( r. 1625\u201349 ) , to form the \u2018 King Charles University of Aberdeen \u2019 . [ 7 ] They were demerged after the Restoration in 1661 . [ 7 ] In 1747 St Leonard 's College in St Andrews was merged into St Salvator 's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard . [ 8 ] A new college of St Andrews was opened in Dundee in 1883 , though initially an independent institution . [ 9 ] The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the University of Aberdeen in 1860 . Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900 . [ 10 ] The University of Edinburgh was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities . [ 10 ] After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled . [ 13 ] New universities included the University of Dundee , Strathclyde , Heriot-Watt , and Stirling . From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges . [ citation needed ] In 1992 , the distinction between universities and colleges was removed . [ 14 ] This created new universities at Abertay , Glasgow Caledonian , Napier , Paisley and Robert Gordon . [ 15 ] in 2001 the University of the Highlands and Islands was created by a federation of 13 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands and gained full university status in 2011 .
