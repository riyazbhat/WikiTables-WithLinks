  "section_title": "Geography",
  "section_text": "Map of Warren County , showing townships and settlements The Wabash River , coming out of Tippecanoe County to the east , defines the southeastern border of the county ; the terrain here is hilly and wooded areas are common . Fountain County lies across the river . By contrast , the northwest region consists mainly of flat prairie farmland ; this continues in Benton County to the north . Along the western side of the county is the border with Vermilion County , Illinois . The small southern border is shared with the north end of the similarly named Indiana county of Vermillion . The state capital of Indianapolis lies about 70 miles ( 110 km ) to the southeast . [ 41 ] Williamsport Falls According to the 2010 census , the county has a total area of 366.40 square miles ( 949.0 km2 ) , of which 364.68 square miles ( 944.5 km2 ) ( or 99.53 % ) is land and 1.72 square miles ( 4.5 km2 ) ( or 0.47 % ) is water . [ 3 ] Elevations in the county range from 480 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level where the Wabash River enters Vermillion County to 830 feet ( 250 m ) in northeastern Prairie Township . [ 47 ] The landscape consists mostly of flat or gently sloping moraine overlaying silty and loamy glacial till , except along the Wabash River where sand , gravel , sandstone and shale are exposed . [ 48 ] Various forms of silt loam constitute most of the county 's soil [ 48 ] and are conducive to agriculture . [ 7 ] Forests cover about 14 % of the county , [ 49 ] mainly around major waterways , [ 50 ] and consist principally of deciduous hardwoods among which maple\u2013beech and oak\u2013hickory forests are the most common . [ 51 ] The only coal mines in the county are located in the southeastern part of Steuben Township , near the Wabash River . [ 52 ] When the county was formed in 1827 , it was divided into four townships : Medina , Warren , Pike and Mound . Over the following decades , many changes were made to the township borders and eight new townships were created . Pine and Washington were the first of these , in March 1830 ; [ 53 ] Steuben followed in 1834 . Liberty was formed in 1843 , Adams in 1848 , then Jordan in 1850 . Kent and Prairie were the last to be created , in 1864 . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] As of 2010 [ update ] , Prairie Township , at 5.4 inhabitants per square mile ( 2.1/km2 ) , has the lowest population density ; it covers more area than any of the other townships\u2014nearly 50 square miles ( 130 km2 ) \u2014and contains no incorporated towns . The highest density is in Washington Township , which has 120 inhabitants per square mile ( 46/km2 ) ; it includes Williamsport , the county 's largest town , and covers only about 20 square miles ( 52 km2 ) . [ 4 ] There are four incorporated towns in the county . The largest is Williamsport , which is on the western banks of the Wabash River in the eastern part of the county , just downstream of Attica ( which is on the east side of the river in Fountain County ) ; in 2010 , its population was 1,898\u2014nearly one-fourth of the county 's total . [ 56 ] West Lebanon is about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) west of Williamsport on State Road 28 , with a population of 723 . [ 57 ] The town of Pine Village lies about 11 miles ( 18 km ) to the north of Williamsport where State Road 55 intersects State Road 26 , near the northern edge of the county ; 217 people live in Pine Village . [ 58 ] State Line City is in the southwestern part of the county and shares its western border with the Illinois state line . A small Illinois community named Illiana lies immediately on the west side of the county road which runs along the state border ( and which is also a street between the two communities ) . State Line City is the smallest of the towns , with a population of 143 . [ 59 ] Railroad crossing sign at Sloan In addition to the incorporated towns , there are over a dozen small unincorporated communities in Warren County [ 60 ] that are historical centers of activity . Now they consist mostly of dwellings , though several have churches and some still have small businesses . The small settlements of Hedrick , Pence and Stewart are in Jordan Township ; Stewart consists of a grain processing facility and a single residence . In Steuben Township , Johnsonville has a church and a handful of residences . Marshfield has an automotive body repair shop , a grain elevator and a church . Independence , platted in 1832 , is located on the site of a trading post set up by Zachariah Cicott . He is buried in a cemetery in Warren Township , just north of town . The township included the small settlement of Winthrop . Liberty Township has three unincorporated communities : Carbondale , Judyville and Kramer ( near the site of the Mudlavia Hotel ) . Several townships contain only a single settlement . Foster is the only one in Mound Township and has a motel and several houses . In the northeast corner of the county , Green Hill is Medina Township 's only settlement . Tab is the only settlement in Prairie Township ; most of this township is agricultural , and a large grain processing facility is Tab 's only remaining business . Pine Township 's only community is Rainsville . [ 61 ] Some settlements did not survive . The river town of Baltimore thrived and was a major center of trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation ; a single house , built long after the town 's heyday , is all that remains . [ 62 ] Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat , but it began to wane after the seat moved , and today no trace is left . [ 63 ] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township , but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little to say on the subject . [ 64 ] Brisco was never large , though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s . It likewise disappeared by the end of the 20th century . Chatterton had a school , a store and a post office , but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps . [ 65 ] Other communities were planned but did not develop . Dresser was never much more than a collection of houses , though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20th century . The settlements of Kickapoo , Locust Grove , Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect . Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder 's residence and a liquor store , and was later described as a `` paper town '' . [ 66 ]",
