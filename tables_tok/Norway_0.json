  "section_text": "Main articles : Administrative divisions of Norway , Counties of Norway , Municipalities of Norway , List of towns and cities in Norway , and Dependencies of Norway See also : S\u00e1pmi ( area ) Norway , a unitary state , is divided into eleven first-level administrative counties ( fylke ) . The counties are administered through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor . Additionally , the King and government are represented in every county by a fylkesmann , who effectively acts as a Governor . [ 151 ] As such , the Government is directly represented at a local level through the County Governors ' offices . The counties are then sub-divided into 356 second-level municipalities ( kommuner ) , which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council , headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet . The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality . Norway has two integral overseas territories : Jan Mayen and Svalbard , the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name , located miles away to the north . There are three Antarctic and Subantarctic dependencies : Bouvet Island , Peter I Island , and Queen Maud Land . On most maps , there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the South Pole until 12 June 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area .

In most cases , the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities .

  "intro": "Norway (Norwegian: Norge (Bokm\u00e5l) or Noreg (Nynorsk); Northern Sami: Norga; Lule Sami: Vuodna; Southern Sami: N\u00f6\u00f6rje), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in Northwestern Europe whose territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also part of the Kingdom of Norway. [note 2] The sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island is a dependent territory and thus not considered part of the kingdom. Norway also lays claim to the Antarctic territories of Queen Maud Land and Peter I Island. Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and a population of 5,312,300 (as of August 2018). The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long). Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak strait to the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. The maritime influence also dominates Norway's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts, whereas the interior, while colder, is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country. Harald V of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg is the current King of Norway. Erna Solberg has been prime minister since 2013 when she replaced Jens Stoltenberg."
