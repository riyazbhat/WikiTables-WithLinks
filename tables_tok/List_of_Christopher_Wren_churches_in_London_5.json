  "section_title": "Churches in the City of London -- Demolished due to the Union of Benefices Act ( chronological order )",
  "section_text": "The population of the City of London declined sharply in the 19th century , and the Union of Benefices Act 1860 reduced the number of parish churches . The surplus churches were demolished .",
  "uid": "List_of_Christopher_Wren_churches_in_London_5",
  "intro": "Sir Christopher Wren was 33 years old and near the beginning of his career as an architect when the Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed many of the city's public buildings, including 88 of its parish churches. Wren's office was commissioned to build 51 replacement churches and St Paul's Cathedral. Many of these buildings survive to this day; others have been substantially altered or rebuilt. Some others were completely or partially destroyed during the German Blitz of 1940-41; yet others were demolished for different reasons."
