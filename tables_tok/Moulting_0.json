Cats have thicker fur during the colder winter months to keep them warm , then around spring and summer they shed some of their fur to get a thinner coat for the warmer summer months . Some cats need brushing during moulting , since dead hairs can get trapped in the cat 's fur",

  "intro": "In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off a part of its body (often, but not always, an outer layer or covering), either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle. Moulting can involve shedding the epidermis (skin), pelage (hair, feathers, fur, wool), or other external layer. In some groups, other body parts may be shed, for example, wings in some insects or the entire exoskeleton in arthropods."
