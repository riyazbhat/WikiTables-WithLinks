          "St George 's Colliery , Back o't ' Church , opened in 1866 south of Tyldesley Station . Its two shafts were sunk by Astley and Tyldesley Coal and Salt Company to the Rams mine . It was linked to Gin Pit Colliery for ventilation . A third shaft to the Trencherbone mine was sunk in 1884 and was deepened to the Arley mine . The colliery worked the Seven Foot mine until 1929 when it became part of Manchester Collieries and ceased coal production in 1941 but was retained for ventilation until 1964"
