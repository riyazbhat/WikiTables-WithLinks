          "Malpas Castle is in the Broxton Hills and was built for the Barons of Malpas . It was part of a series of defences along the Welsh border , and was linked with Aldford and Shocklach castles ( Shocklach was also built by the Barons of Malpas ) . Its links with Alford and Shocklach castles and the Barons of Malpas means it was probably built in the 12th century . The motte survives to 3.7 metres ( 12 ft ) in height and is 37 m ( 40 yd ) in diameter and is surrounded by a ditch . Although there is no sign of a bailey , there was probably one to the south of the motte ; the site today is heavily disturbed and covered in grass ."
