  "intro": "For the 1964 Summer Olympics, a total of thirty-three sports venues were used. Six of the venues were built before the International Olympic Committee awarded the 1964 Games to Tokyo in 1959. This included two venues that hosted the 1958 Asian Games. There were thirteen new, eight temporary, and five reconstructed and/or renovated venues that were used during the event. During the Olympics, wind and weather had issues with two athletic events. After the Olympics, one venue (Osaka Stadium) hosted both a FIFA World Cup and a World Athletics Championship event while another (Tokyo National Stadium) also hosted a World Athletics Championship event."
