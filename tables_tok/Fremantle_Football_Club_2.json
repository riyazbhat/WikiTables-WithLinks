  "intro": "The Fremantle Football Club, nicknamed the Dockers, is a professional Australian rules football team that competes in the Australian Football League (AFL). It was founded in 1994 in honour of the rich footballing history associated with the Western Australian port city of Fremantle, and entered the AFL the following year, making it the second team from the state after the West Coast Eagles to be admitted to the competition. Originally based at Fremantle Oval, the club's training facilities and administrative headquarters are now located nearby at Cockburn ARC in Cockburn Central. The club's guernsey is purple and white. High-profile players since the club's inception include six time All-Australian Matthew Pavlich, dual Brownlow Medal winner Nat Fyfe, and the league's former all-time tallest player Aaron Sandilands. Currently captained by Fyfe, the club is coached by Justin Longmuir, who replaced Ross Lyon at the end of the 2019 home-and-away season. Fremantle is one of only three active AFL clubs (the others being Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney) that has not won a premiership, however it did win the minor premiership in 2015, and reached the 2013 AFL Grand Final which it lost to Hawthorn. Fremantle has had a team in the AFL Women's league since its inception in 2017. They are coached by Trent Cooper and captained by Kara Antonio."
