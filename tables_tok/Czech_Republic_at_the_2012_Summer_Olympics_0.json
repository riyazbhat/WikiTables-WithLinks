  "intro": "Czech Republic competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics after gaining its independence from the former Czechoslovakia. The Czech Olympic Committee sent a total of 133 athletes to the Games, 68 men and 65 women, to compete in 19 sports. Czech Republic left London with a total of 11 medals (4 gold, 3 silver, and 4 bronze), the same total achieved in Atlanta. This was in stark contrast with the zero medal tally of the neighbouring Austria, a nation of roughly comparable size. Finishing the nineteenth position in the medal standings was the second best performance for the Czech Republic in the post-Czechoslovak era. Among the nation's medalists were Barbora \u0160pot\u00e1kov\u00e1, who successfully defended her Olympic title in women's javelin throw, and rower Ond\u0159ej Synek, who managed to repeat his silver medal in men's single sculls. Three Czech athletes won Olympic gold medals for the first time in history: single sculls rower Miroslava Knapkov\u00e1, modern pentathlete David Svoboda, and mountain biker Jaroslav Kulhav\u00fd. Several Czech athletes, however, missed out of medal standings in the finals, including rifle shooter and defending champion Kate\u0159ina Emmons, and javelin thrower V\u00edt\u011bzslav Vesel\u00fd. For the first time in its history, the Czech House (located in the Business Design Centre in borough of Islington) had become accessible to the public (i.e. not only the team members and VIPs), attracting over 78,000 visitors during the Olympics. In a brief comparison of selected national centres, AP news agency even awarded this project an imaginary gold medal."
