  "intro": "The Miami metropolitan area, also known as the Greater Miami Area or South Florida, is the 72nd largest metropolitan area in the world and the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located in southern Florida with 6,198,782 inhabitants as of 2018, the Miami metropolitan area is the most populous in Florida and second largest in the southeastern United States. It extends about 120 miles (190 km) from north to south. The metropolitan area is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL (MSA), consisting of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, a metropolitan statistical area used for statistical purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other agencies. Its land area is 6,137 sq. mi (15,890 km2). Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties are the first, second, and third most populous counties in Florida, and Miami-Dade, with 2,761,581 people in 2018, is the seventh most populous county in the United States. The three counties together are known as the Greater Miami Area and have principal cities including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Hialeah, Pembroke Pines and Boca Raton. Besides its association with the South Florida region, which includes the Everglades and the Florida Keys, it is also synonymous with an area known collectively as the Gold Coast. The Census Bureau also defines a wider region based on commuting patterns, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. Lucie, FL Combined Statistical Area (CSA), with an estimated population of 6,723,472 in 2016. This includes the four additional counties of Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, and Okeechobee. Because the population of South Florida is largely confined to a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades, the Miami urbanized area (that is, the area of contiguous urban development) is about 100 miles (160 km) long (north to south), but never more than 20 miles (32 km) wide, and in some areas only 5 miles (8.0 km) wide (east to west)."
