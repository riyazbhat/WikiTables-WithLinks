  "section_text": "For a person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor , they must have made `` significant contributions to the game of basketball '' . [ 3 ] Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959 , seven individuals were inducted as contributors , including James Naismith , the inventor of basketball . All former NBA commissioners ( Maurice Podoloff , Walter Kennedy , Larry O'Brien , and David Stern ) have been inducted . Fourteen individuals inducted as contributors have won the John Bunn Award , awarded by the Hall annually to a significant contributor : John Bunn ( its inaugural recipient ) , Walter Kennedy , Clifford Fagan , Edward Gottlieb , Daniel Biasone , Larry O'Brien , Dave Gavitt , C. M. Newton , Tex Winter , Meadowlark Lemon , Tom Jernstedt , Tom `` Satch '' Sanders , George Raveling , [ 4 ] and Rod Thorn . Two inductees in this category are women : Senda Berenson Abbott and Bertha Teague ( both inducted in 1985 ) . The most recent contributor to be inducted is Jerry Reinsdorf , who entered the Hall in 2016 . [ 5 ] The exact number of individuals enshrined as contributors ( as well as the number of player inductees ) is subject to debate because of the Hall 's treatment of 2014 inductee Nathaniel `` Sweetwater '' Clifton , one of the first African Americans to play in the NBA . While he was initially announced as a contributor , [ 7 ] the Hall now classifies him as a player inductee . [ 8 ] Six inductees in this category were associated with teams that have been inducted to the Hall as units . Naismith organized The First Team , the group of players involved in the first-ever basketball game in 1891 and also inducted as part of the inaugural Class of 1959 . Robert L. Douglas , inducted in 1972 , was the founder and owner of the New York Renaissance , inducted in 1963 . Pete Newell , inducted in 1979 , was the head coach of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team inducted in 2010 . Three were associated with the Harlem Globetrotters , inducted in 2002 . Abe Saperstein , inducted in 1971 , was the team 's founder and owner . Kennedy , although best known for his time as NBA commissioner , had been the Globetrotters ' public relations director in the 1950s . Lemon , inducted in 2003 , was one of the team 's most enduring on-court stars Ten individuals inducted in this category were born outside the United States\u2014Naismith and Newell in Canada , Podoloff and Gottlieb in modern-day Ukraine ( part of the Russian Empire when they were born in 1890 and 1898 respectively ) , Douglas in Saint Kitts and Nevis ( part of the British West Indies at his birth in 1882 ) , Saperstein in the United Kingdom , Biasone and Renato William Jones in Italy , Ferenc Hepp in modern-day Hungary ( Austria\u2013Hungary at his birth in 1909 ) , and Borislav Stankovi\u0107 in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina ( the Kingdom of Yugoslavia at his birth in 1925 ) In total , 65 or 66 individuals , depending on how Clifton is classified , have been inducted as contributors Luther Gulick , inducted in 1959 Amos Alonzo Stagg , inducted in 1959",
