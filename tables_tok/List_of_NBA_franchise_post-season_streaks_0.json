  "intro": "This is a list of National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise post-season appearance streaks. This list includes the all-time and the active consecutive playoffs appearance. Aside from the NBA Playoff appearance streaks, this list also includes the NBA Finals appearance streak and the NBA championships win streak. On March 24, 1971, the Philadelphia 76ers (formerly known as the Syracuse Nationals) set an NBA record of 22 consecutive playoff appearances in the time between the 1950 NBA Playoffs and the 1971 NBA Playoffs. The 76ers won two NBA championships during their streak. As of 2019, the San Antonio Spurs are tied for the NBA record of 22 consecutive playoff appearances. The Spurs' streak started in the 1998 NBA Playoffs and is, as of 2019, the longest active playoff streak in any major North American sports league. The Spurs have won five NBA championships during their streak. The Boston Celtics hold the longest consecutive NBA Finals appearance streak with ten appearances between 1957 and 1966. During the streak, the Celtics won eight consecutive NBA championships - also an NBA record."
