  "intro": "For the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now Bosnia and Herzegovina), a total of nine sports venues were used. The idea for the Games came around from a 1968 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study on promoting winter tourism in Yugoslavia. After Sarajevo was awarded the 1984 Games in 1978, venue construction and renovation took place between 1979 and 1983. Weather postponed the men's downhill alpine skiing event three times before it was finally run. The men's cross-country skiing 30 km event was run during a blizzard. After the games, all but one of the venues were damaged during the Bosnian War and the Siege of Sarajevo. After the war, Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt and is in use as of 2010."
