It is the second largest mosque in Pakistan after Faisal Mosque and can accommodate over 100,000 worshipers in its hall and surroundings . The mosque is located opposite to Lahore Fort and symbolizes the rich Mughal architecture . It was the largest mosque in the Mughal empire and held the record of being the largest mosque in the world for 313 years until 1986 . Under Sikh and British rule from 1799 to 1939 , the mosque was used as military garrison and was severely damaged . Extensive repair work were done after 1939 and by 1960 it was restored to its original conditions . A small museum containing relics of Prophet Muhammad , his cousin Ali , and his daughter Fatimah is established inside the mosque",
