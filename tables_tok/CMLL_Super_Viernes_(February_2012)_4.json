  "intro": "In February 2012 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held four CMLL Super Viernes shows, all of which took place in Arena M\u00e9xico on Friday nights. Some of the matches from Super Viernes were taped for CMLL's weekly shows that aired in Mexico the week following the Super Viernes show. The shows featured various professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, the bad guys) or faces (technicos in Mexico, the good guys) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public. The primary storylines that played out on Super Viernes in February 2012 included the build to a Luchas de Apuestas (Bet match) between Negro Casas and Blue Panther. The match between the two took place on March 3, 2012 at the 2012 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, but the build up of the storyline leading into the show culminated in February. CMLL also held the 2012 version of the Reyes del Aire (Kings of the Air) tournament on February 3 as well as the preliminary rounds of their third annual Torneo Nacional De Parejas Increibles tournament, the finals of the tournament took place at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas."
