  "intro": "Canada's Wonderland is a 134-hectare (330-acre) theme park located in Vaughan, Ontario, a suburb approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of Downtown Toronto. Opened in 1981 by the Taft Broadcasting Company and The Great-West Life Assurance Company as the first major theme park in Canada, it remains the country's largest. The park, currently owned by Cedar Fair, has been the most visited seasonal amusement park in North America for several consecutive years. As a seasonal park, Canada's Wonderland is open daily from May to Labour Day, with weekend openings in late April and after Labour Day until October 27th. They removed Halloween day Halloween Haunt due to the transition between Halloween Haunt and Winterfest With seventeen roller coasters, Canada's Wonderland is ranked second in the world by number of roller coasters, after Six Flags Magic Mountain (19 coasters) and tied with Cedar Point (17 coasters). The 134-hectare (330-acre) park includes an 8-hectare (20-acre) water park named Splash Works. The park holds Halloween Haunt, a Halloween-themed event, each fall, as well as special events throughout the season, including various food festivals, as well as Celebration Canada, a month-long Canada Day festival, among others. Beginning in 2019, the park launched WinterFest, a holiday-themed event that would extend the park's operating season to late December. The park was known as Paramount Canada's Wonderland when it was owned by National Amusements via Paramount Parks from 1993 to 2006. Following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 2006, Paramount was dropped from the name. In 2018, it was the most visited seasonal amusement park in North America as well as the second most visited Cedar Fair amusement park, behind Knott's Berry Farm in California with an estimated 3.79 million visitors."
