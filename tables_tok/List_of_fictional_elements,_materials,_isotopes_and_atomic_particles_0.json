        "As a noun , adamant has long been used to designate any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and , formerly , a legendary stone/rock or mineral of impenetrable hardness and with many other properties , often identified with diamond or lodestone . The English word is used both as a noun and an adjective and is derived from the Latin : adamans , adamantem [ accusative ] referring to the property of impregnable , diamondlike hardness , or to describe a very firm/resolute position , itself from the Greek word adamastos meaning untameable . Diamond is also derived from the same word . Adamant and the literary form adamantine ( utilising the suffix -ine meaning 'of the nature of ' or 'made of ' ) occur in many works . In mythology Kronos was said to have used an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus ; in Prometheus Bound , Prometheus is bound to the rocks in adamantine bonds infrangible , in Virgil 's Aeneid ( in which the gates of Tartarus are protected by columns of solid adamantine ) and in Paradise Lost , in which adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell , Satan 's shield , fallen angel 's armour and Satan 's chains . In fiction Adamant is referred to in The Faerie Queene , Gulliver 's Travels , A Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Lord of the Rings , His Dark Materials trilogy , and the games Final Fantasy and RuneScape and many more besides . Adamantine is referred to in the film Forbidden Planet ( as adamantine steel ) , in many books such as Mary Shelley 's Mathilda , and Mark Twain 's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , as well as many games including Dungeons & Dragons . The word adamant is used as the basis for other fictional materials such as Adamantium ( see below ) , Adamantite ( see below ) , Adamantle ( from the Sims ) , and Adiamante ( from L. E. Modesitt Jr. 's 1996 novel of the same name )",

        "A fictional metal alloy that appears in the Marvel Universe , first appearing in Marvel Comics ' Avengers # 66 ( July 1969 ) , by writer Roy Thomas and artists Barry Windsor-Smith and Syd Shores . Although it is first presented as part of the character Ultron 's outer shell , it is best known as the substance bonded to the character Wolverine 's skeleton and claws . The defining quality of adamantium is its practical indestructibility . Adamantium is not depicted as being a naturally occurring metal but rather as having been inadvertently invented by the fictional American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain in an attempt to recreate his prior discovery , a unique alloy of steel and vibranium . Despite its potential applications in armament and armature , adamantium is rarely used due to its high cost and inability to be reshaped . Other forms of adamantium of varying durability are mentioned within the Marvel Universe , including Secondary Adamantium , Adamantium Beta and Carbonadium . Aside from Ultron 's outer shell and Wolverine 's skeleton and claws , Adamantium is associated with a number of other characters and implements including , but not limited to , Bullseye 's spinal column , certain iterations of Captain America 's shield and Lady Deathstrike 's skeleton and talons . The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective adamant ( see entry above ) adding the Neo-Latin '-ium ' to denote a metallic name . Adamantium is also used in the Games Workshop universe of Warhammer 40000 and the MMORPG Maplestory",

        "A metallic element with variable properties ; a substitute for any unspecified substance or element ; or in science fiction writing , a substance or process invented to circumvent explanation or impossibility . A humorous story from 1926 about the development of alloys for special purposes , describes Bolognium as a metallic element with properties similar to Gafnium , with which it forms alloys impervious to attacks by mice . Bolognium may also refer to any unspecified substance or element : if not oil then beryllium , and if not beryllium then bolognium , do n't worry about whether it is mercury or lead or cadmium or 'bolognium ' . Noted science fiction writer David Gerrold attributes the use of the term in science fiction writing to Larry Niven , the author of Ringworld , who used it to describe imaginary materials or processes capable of explaining properties unachievable through known or scientifically-postulated means . In Worlds of Wonder , Gerrold describes two examples from Ringworld : scrith , a substance strong enough to be used for the construction of a ring one hundred and eighty million miles in diameter , and a character deliberately bred for the property of luck . Gerrold refers to bolognium as technobabble , and cautions writers against overusing it , or using it carelessly , as doing so undermines the illusion of reality upon which good science fiction relies . The term itself has appeared in episodes of The Simpsons , in which Bolognium , atomic symbol Bo , appears in the place of Molybdenum , atomic number 42 , on promotional copies of the periodic table produced by Oscar Mayer ( its atomic weight is delicious or snacktacular ) , and in Futurama , where Cubert Farnsworth exclaims , your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolognium ! Although most references to Bolognium are intentionally humorous , in Star Trek : The Eugenics Wars , Greg Cox refers to the bolognium shielding of Klingon warp nacelles",

        "Originally appearing in Uncle Scrooge # 17 ( 1957 ) by Carl Barks , Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world . Even though it is very coveted , its usage potential is not entirely known . One characteristic is that it tastes different every time one tries it , and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream : a different flavor of ice cream each time . To avoid evaporation , bombastium must be kept frozen . In the story , when this totally new element was discovered Scrooge tries to secure the entire supply - a ball of Bombastium approximately the size of a large turnip . Terrified that his acquisition will melt before he can make a profit , Scrooge drags Donald Duck and his nephews on a voyage to the South Pole to safeguard his investment , but he has not reckoned on the ruthless determination of the Brutopian agents he outbid to achieve it . Bombastium represents a play on words ( bomb and bombastic ) that negotiates Cold War hysteria surrounding the arms race and the threat of Armageddon provoked by the development of the H-bomb . Barks 's tale is also grounded in fears . The substance is later used in the Duck Tales series",
