Goldwyn producers were still dissatisfied , so von Stroheim sent the film to his friend and fellow director , Rex Ingram , who turned it over to his editor , Grant Whytock . After many more cuts , Whytock quit and new editor Joseph Farnham got the job and cut it even further to 10 reels . Von Stroheim said that the movie was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat , and disowned the film as edited by the studio",
