  "intro": "Project Runway Season 12 is the twelfth season of the television show Project Runway, appearing on Lifetime. The season began airing on July 18, 2013 with 15 designers competing to become the next great American designer. Kate Pankoke, a designer from Season 11 returned to compete once again for the grand prize. Pankoke was voted back by fans in an online poll, winning against Ra'mon Lawrence Coleman of Season 6, and Valerie Mayen of Season 8\n Supermodel Heidi Klum, Marie Claire creative director Nina Garcia, and fashion designer Zac Posen all returned as judges this season. Tim Gunn returned as the workroom mentor. This was also the first season to feature the Tim Gunn save, which gave Gunn the opportunity to bring an eliminated designer back into the competition if he disagreed with the judges. Belk was the exclusive retail sponsor for Project Runway's 12th season and has merchandised the accessory wall with an assortment of products. In 2014, Alexandria von Bromssen, Kate Pankoke, Justin LeBlanc and Helen Castillo competed in the fourth season of Project Runway All Stars, with Alexandria placing 13th, Kate placing 11th, Justin placing 7th and Helen placing 3rd. In 2016, Alexander Pope, Ken Laurence and Dom Streater competed in the fifth season of All Stars, with Alexander placing 8th, Ken placing 3rd and Dom winning the competition. Helen Castillo and Ken Laurence would later reappear in Project Runway All Stars (season 6) where Helen Placed 6th and Ken Placed 4th."
