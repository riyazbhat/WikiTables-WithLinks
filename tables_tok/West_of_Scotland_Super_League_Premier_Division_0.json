  "intro": "The SJFA West Region Premiership (also known as the McBookie.com West Region Premiership for sponsorship reasons) is a semi-professional football league run by the West Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association and is the highest tier of league competition for its member clubs. The current (2019) champions are Auchinleck Talbot. Formerly known as the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division, the league was created in 2002 with the amalgamation of the top leagues of the Central and Ayrshire regions. Since the 2007-08 season, the winners of the league have been eligible to enter the senior Scottish Cup at its earliest stage, with Pollok being the first champions to take part in the Scottish Cup. Since 2002, two clubs have been automatically relegated to the Super League First Division, and are replaced by the clubs placed first and second in that division. A relegation play-off was added in 2006-07 where the club which finishes third bottom contests a two-legged play-off against the team which finishes third in the Super League First Division. West Region clubs voted in 2017 to organise all leagues on a regionwide basis and as a result, the Super League Premier Division was rebranded as the West Region Premiership from 2018 onwards and will consist of sixteen clubs. Clubs will be relegated to a rebranded Championship also consisting of sixteen teams."
