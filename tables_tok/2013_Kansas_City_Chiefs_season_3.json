  "intro": "The 2013 Kansas City Chiefs season was the franchise's 54th season and the first under the head coach/general manager tandem of Andy Reid and John Dorsey. After their 26-16 defeat of the Philadelphia Eagles in week 3, the Chiefs beat their 2-game win total from 2012. After defeating the New York Giants 31-7 in week 4, the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to win 2 or fewer games in the previous season, and win the first 4 games the next. On October 13, 2013 against the Oakland Raiders, Chiefs fans broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium with 137.6 decibels. Seattle Seahawks fans later reclaimed the record on December 2, 2013, with a roar of 137.6 decibels. After the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Denver Broncos in week 7, the Chiefs were the final undefeated team in the NFL. They were the first team in NFL history to earn the number one draft pick and be the last undefeated team in consecutive years. The Chiefs clinched a playoff berth, but lost to the Indianapolis Colts in the Wild Card round of the playoffs by a score of 45-44, after blowing a 38-10 second half lead, extending an 8-game playoff losing streak dating back to the 1993 season, which was the worst in NFL history."
