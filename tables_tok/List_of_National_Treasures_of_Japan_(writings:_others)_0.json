  "section_title": "Treasures -- Buddhist writings",
  "section_text": "The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje in the form of classical Chinese books and sutras , likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls ( kansubon ) . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century ( around 400 ) , and certainly in conjunction with the introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century . [ 7 ] [ 10 ] The increasing popularity of Buddhism , strongly promoted by Prince Sh\u014dtoku ( 574\u2013622 ) , in the late-6th century and early-7th century was one of the factors [ nb 3 ] leading to a rise in the importance of writing . [ 11 ] Buddhism required the study of sutras in Chinese . To satisfy the growing demand for them , imported Sui and Tang manuscripts were copied , first by Korean and Chinese immigrants , and later in the mid-7th century by Japanese scribes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Sangy\u014d Gisho ( `` Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras '' ) , traditionally attributed to Prince Sh\u014dtoku , is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length . [ 14 ] By 673 the entire Buddhist canon had been systematically copied . [ 8 ] [ 15 ] Not a single sutra survives from before the end of the 6th century . [ 16 ] The oldest extant complete sutra copied in Japan dates to 686 and has been designated a National Treasure . [ 15 ] [ 17 ] During the 7th and 8th centuries , the copying of Buddhist texts , including sutras , dominated writing . Few Chinese secular or local Japanese works ( which were rare ) were copied . [ 17 ] The state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau ( shaky\u014djo ) before 727 [ nb 4 ] with highly specialized calligraphers , proofreaders and metal polishers to satisfy the large demand for Buddhist texts . [ 8 ] [ 11 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 18 ] Sutra copying was not only for duplication but also to acquire religious merit ; [ 15 ] [ 19 ] thus nearly all Buddhist texts were hand-copied during the 8th century despite knowledge of printing . [ 14 ] The peak of sutra copying occurred in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom ( Daihannya ) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied . [ 17 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow . [ nb 5 ] [ 22 ] However , some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo , purple or other colored paper\u2014particularly the ones that were produced in 741 when Emperor Sh\u014dmu decreed Konk\u014dmy\u014d Saish\u014d\u014d sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples . [ 8 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Many sutra copies contain a colophon with the name of the sponsor\u2014often somebody from the ruling class\u2014and the reason of copying , usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state . [ 13 ] [ 21 ] After the shaky\u014djo closed at the end of the 8th century , the imperial family and leading aristocrats continued to sponsor sutra copying . [ 18 ] Because of an enhanced belief in the powers of the Lotus Sutra , more Heian period copies of this sutra exist than of all other sutras combined . [ 25 ] Starting in the early Heian period , styles became flowery and ornate with lavish decorations as sutras were not used only in recitation but for dedication and sacrifice . [ 22 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Devotional sutra copying was more often undertaken by the initiator than in the Nara period . [ 8 ] [ 25 ] New forms of decoration came in fashion by the early-11th century including placing each character in the outline of a stupa , on lotus pedestals or next to depictions of Boddhisattvas . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Sutras were increasingly furnished with frontispieces starting in the 11th century . [ 28 ] Calligraphy shifted from Chinese to Japanese style . [ 30 ] Sutra copying continued into the Kamakura and subsequent periods , but only rarely to comparable artistic effect . [ 29 ] With the import of printed Song editions in the Kamakura period , hand-copying of the complete scriptures died out and sutra copying was only practiced for its devotional aspect . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Forty-seven sutras or sets of sutras from the 6th century Western Wei to 14th century Nanboku-ch\u014d period have been designated National Treasures . Some of the oldest items in this list originated in China . [ 4 ]",
