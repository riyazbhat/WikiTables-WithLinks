  "intro": "Malaysia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1964, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except when Malaysia participated in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics . Malaysia made their debut at the Winter Olympic Games in 2018. The Federation of Malaya (now the states comprising West Malaysia) competed as Malaya (MAL) in the 1956 and 1960 Games. The present day state of Sabah sent an independent team to the 1956 Games as North Borneo , and Singapore also competed at the Olympics from 1948 to 1960. After these British colonies federated to form an independent Malaysia in 1963, the nation competed under that name for the first time at the 1964 Summer Olympics . Malaysia would inherit Malaya's code MAL until 1988 when it started competing under its present code MAS. Singapore would subsequently regain independence from Malaysia in 1965 and compete once again as Singapore from 1968 onwards. Malaysian athletes have won a total of 11 Olympic medals, 8 in badminton , 2 in diving and 1 in cycling . The first Malaysian Olympians to win Olympic medals could have been Punch Gunalan and Ng Boon Bee , who lost their final match in badminton men's doubles. As badminton was only a demonstration sport in 1972, there were no official medals then; Malaysia thus had to wait for the first medal until 1992. The most successful Malaysian Olympian by medals won is Lee Chong Wei with 3 silver medals in badminton. [ citation needed ] \n The National Olympic Committee for Malaya was created in 1953 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1954."
