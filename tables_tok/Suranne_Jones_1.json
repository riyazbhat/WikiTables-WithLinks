  "intro": "Sarah Anne Akers (n\u00e9e Jones; born 27 August 1978), better known as Suranne Jones, is an English actress and producer. She rose to prominence as Karen McDonald in Coronation Street between 2000 and 2004. Upon leaving, she furthered her television career in drama series including Vincent (2005-2006), Strictly Confidential (2006), and Harley Street (2008). Her portrayal of convicted murderer Ruth Slater in the mini-series Unforgiven (2009) received acclaim. Between 2011 and 2016, Jones starred as Detective Rachel Bailey in the police procedural Scott & Bailey, her second collaboration with screenwriter Sally Wainwright after Unforgiven. She garnered further attention for her roles in Single Father, Five Days (both 2010) and The Crimson Field (2014), as well as stage work including productions of A Few Good Men (2005), Blithe Spirit (2009), Top Girls (2011), Beautiful Thing (2013), and Orlando (2014). For her portrayal of Gemma Foster, a successful GP who suffers personal betrayal, in Doctor Foster (2015-2017), Jones won several awards including a Broadcasting Press Guild award and the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress in 2016. Following the conclusion of Doctor Foster, Jones returned to theatre, starring in a production of Frozen for which she received favourable notices. On television, Jones has starred in Save Me (2018) and Gentleman Jack (2019), the latter her third collaboration with Wainwright."
