In 1914 a Tudor office and chapel building were added , both designed by Mount Clemens architect Theophilus Van Damme . Family mausoleums and crypts are scattered among the in-ground burials , as well as a wide variety of 19th and early 20th century monuments . The cemetery is an outstanding example of an urban , park-like memorial burial ground , retaining the feel of a Victorian-era rural cemetery through both landscaping and the variety and quality of its gravemarkers",
