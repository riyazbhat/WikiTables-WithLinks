  "intro": "Mark Anthony Selby (born 19 June 1983) is an English professional snooker player. He has been World Snooker Champion three times and was number one in the world rankings for over four years continuously. He has won 17 ranking titles, which puts him in seventh place by ranking tournament wins in history. Selby joined the main professional snooker tour in 1999 at the age of 16, after competing on the UK Challenge Tour in 1998. [citation needed] He was runner-up to John Higgins at the 2007 World Snooker Championship. Having won three Masters titles (2008, 2010, and 2013), two UK Championships (2012 and 2016), and three World Championships (2014, 2016, and 2017), he was the sixth player to win all of snooker's Triple Crown events at least twice. His other ranking titles include the Welsh Open in 2008, the Shanghai Masters in 2011, the German Masters in 2015, the China Open in 2015, 2017, and 2018, the Paul Hunter Classic in 2016, the International Championship in 2016 and 2017, the China Championship in 2018, the English Open in 2019, and the Scottish Open also in 2019. Known as a patient, tough competitor with strong safety play, Selby is also a prolific break-builder and has compiled over 600 century breaks in his professional career. His nickname, The Jester from Leicester, was given to him by snooker compere Richard Beare. Selby is also a pool player. He was the 2006 WEPF eight-ball pool world champion and was the 2015 Chinese Pool World Championship runner-up."
