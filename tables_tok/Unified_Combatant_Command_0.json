  "intro": "A unified combatant command (UCC) is a command of the United States Armed Forces that is composed of units from at least two service branches and has a broad and continuing mission. These commands are established to provide effective command and control of U.S. military forces, regardless of branch of service, in peace and war. They are organized either on a geographical basis (known as area of responsibility, AOR) or on a functional basis, such as special operations, power projection, or transport. UCCs are joint commands with specific badges denoting their affiliation. The creation and organization of the unified combatant commands is legally mandated in Title 10, U.S. Code Sections 161-168. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) establishes the missions, command responsibilities, and geographic areas of responsibility of the unified combatant commands. As of August 2019, there are eleven unified combatant commands. Seven have regional responsibilities, and four have functional responsibilities. Each time the Unified Command Plan is updated, the organization of the combatant commands is reviewed for military efficiency and efficacy, as well as alignment with national policy. Each unified command is led by a combatant commander (CCDR), who is a four-star general or admiral. CCDRs exercise combatant command (COCOM), a specific type of nontransferable command authority over assigned forces, regardless of branch of service, that is vested only in the CCDRs by federal law in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 164."
