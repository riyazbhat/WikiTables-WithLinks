  "section_title": "Luxembourg Income Study -- Median equivalized disposable household income ( PPP ) $",
  "section_text": "See also the country lists in the median income article . Median household income divides households in a country or region into two equal segments with the first half of households earning less than the median household income and the other half earning more . It is considered by many statisticians to be a better indicator than the mean household income as it is not dramatically affected by unusually high or low values . [ 15 ]",
  "uid": "Household_income_1",
  "intro": "Household income is a measure of the combined incomes of all people sharing a particular household or place of residence. It includes every form of income, e.g., salaries and wages, retirement income, near cash government transfers like food stamps, and investment gains. Average household incomes need not map directly to measures of an individual's earnings such as per capita income as numbers of people sharing households and numbers of income earners per household can vary significantly between regions and over time. Average household income can be used as an indicator for the monetary well-being of a country's citizens. Mean or median net household income, after taxes and mandatory contributions, are taken as indicators of standard of living, because they include only disposable income and acknowledge people sharing accommodation benefit from pooling at least some of their living costs. It is important to note in the tables below the difference between median and mean income. Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group."
