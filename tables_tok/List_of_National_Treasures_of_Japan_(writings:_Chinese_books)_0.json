  "section_title": "Treasures -- Chinese manuscripts",
  "section_text": "Japan 's first experience with books and written language [ nb 3 ] came from books written in Classical Chinese in China , brought to Japan from the Korean kingdoms , at least by the 5th and probably by the end of the 4th century . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] According to legend , the scholar Wani came to Japan in 406 and brought with him the Confucian Analects and Thousand Character Classic . [ nb 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] These were followed , in later years , by the Five Classics ( Book of Odes , Book of History , Book of Rites , Book of Changes and the Spring and Autumn Annals ) , which , by the 6th century , became well-known among the Japanese literary elite . [ 6 ] [ 8 ] [ 10 ] The Seventeen-article constitution , compiled in 604 by Prince Sh\u014dtoku , has quotations that allow the identification of 18 Chinese books known to have existed in Japan at the time : [ 6 ] Odes , Rites , Classic of Filial Piety , Analects , Chronicle of Zuo , the Han Chronicles ( Book of Han and Book of the Later Han ) , Wen Xuan anthology , Zhuangzi and other classical Chinese writings . [ nb 5 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Some books such as the Yupian or the Meih\u014dki were lost early in China , because of the persecution against Buddhism or for other reasons . The titles survived , however , because of the large volume of books previously imported to Japan , which were then subsequently re-exported to China . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Today , some of the oldest extant manuscripts of Chinese books dating to the Tang Dynasty are located in Japan . [ 18 ] Few of the early imported manuscripts have survived . Some of those that survived are listed as National Treasures below . [ 16 ] Twenty Chinese book National Treasures exist that were created in China and subsequently imported to Japan . Of these , 19 date to the Tang Dynasty and one to the Southern Song . The designated items are of various type : six treasures are manuscripts of the Five Classics of Confucianism and associated commentaries , four are poetry and prose anthologies of Chinese poets , calligraphers and Emperor Huizong of Song , four are dictionaries , five are anecdote collections and one is a music score . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_Chinese_books)_0",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 56 entries from the 7th century Tang Dynasty to the Kamakura period with more than half originating in China. The total number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The list contains works that have been originally compiled in China by Chinese authors. A large proportion of these works are Chinese classics. Written language was introduced to Japan around 400 AD in the form of Chinese books written in Classical Chinese. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased towards the end of the 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, and to bring back books. During circa 300 years in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand."
