Bl\u0101zma won the promotion/relegation play-off against Tranz\u012bts Ventspils with 6\u20131 on aggregate . However , after several mergers and withdrawals Tranz\u012bts were also awarded a place in Virsl\u012bga , as the runners-up of First League . FK R\u012bga withdrew due to unpaid debts . [ 2 ] They eventually merged with Olimps R\u012bga and created a new club called Olimps/RFS . The new club plays in Virsl\u012bga , what saved Olimps R\u012bga from relegation . [ 3 ] On 12 January 2009 Vindava withdrew from Virsl\u012bga due to financial reasons .

  "intro": "Latvian Higher League 2009 (Latvian: Virsl\u012bga) was the 18th season of top-tier football in Latvia. It began on 14 March 2009 with the first round of games and ended on 8 November 2009 with the 36th round of matches. Ventspils were the defending champions. Due to numerous pre-season team changes, such as club mergers and withdrawals, the format of the league was changed. Since there are only 9 clubs that participate in 2009 Virsl\u012bga, every team plays 4 times against every other team, what will make every team playing 32 games. Contrary to the previous season, there is not Championship and Relegation pool."
