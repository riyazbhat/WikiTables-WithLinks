  "intro": "The United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility (USP Florence ADMAX) is an American federal prison that provides a higher level of custody than a maximum security prison. It is classed as a supermax or control unit prison, where the safety of inmates and staff is paramount. It is located in unincorporated Fremont County, Colorado, near Florence, and opened in 1994, and it is informally known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies. The Federal Bureau of Prisons needed a unit designed specifically for the secure housing of those prisoners most capable of violence toward staff or other inmates. As of December 2019[update], there are 376 prisoners who spend 23 hours per day in single cells with facilities made of poured concrete to deter self-harm, and 24-hour supervision, carried out intensively with high staff-inmate ratios. Phones are generally banned and only limited broadcast entertainment is permitted. After three years in maximum confinement, some prisoners may be transferred to a less restrictive prison. The aim is to encourage reasonably peaceful behavior from the most violent career prisoners."
