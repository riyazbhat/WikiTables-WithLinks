  "intro": "The 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks season was the third season for the Bucks. Milwaukee posted a 66-16 record in only its third year of existence, and its second since getting Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Key part of the championship season was the acquisition of Oscar Robertson. Other role players on the Bucks included players such as Bob Dandridge (18.4 ppg) and Jon McGlocklin (15.8 ppg), power forward Greg Smith and key reserves Lucius Allen, Bob Boozer and Dick Cunningham completing the nucleus. The season included a 20-game winning streak, the NBA's longest at the time, and still ranked fifth all-time. And the Bucks became the first team from the Midwest Division to win the NBA title; it would be 23 years before the Houston Rockets would do the same."
