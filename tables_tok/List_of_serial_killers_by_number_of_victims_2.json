Pacciani was scheduled for retrial in 1998 when he died after taking medication contraindicated to his heart problems . Pacciani 's two alleged accomplices , Mario Vanni and Giancarlo Lotti , were sentenced to life and 30 years in prison , respectively . Some believe that none of the accused were guilty , and that Lotti incriminated himself and the other two because he was homeless and wanted to live in prison",
