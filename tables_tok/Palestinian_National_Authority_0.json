The governorates are not regulated in any official law of decree by the Palestinian Authority [ 117 ] but they are regulated by Presidential decrees , mainly Presidential Decree No . 22 of 2003 , regarding the powers of the governors . [ 118 ] The regional governors ( Arabic : \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u200e muhafiz ) are appointed by the President . They are in charge of the Palestinian police force in their jurisdiction as well as coordinating state services such as education , health and transportation . The governorates are under the direct supervision of the Interior Ministry . [ 117 ] The governorates in the West Bank are grouped into three areas per the Oslo II Accord . Area A forms 18 % of the West Bank by area , and is administered by the Palestinian Authority . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Area B forms 22 % of the West Bank , and is under Palestinian civil control , and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Area C , except East Jerusalem , forms 60 % of the West Bank , and is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration , except that the Palestinian Authority provides the education and medical services to the 150,000 Palestinians in the area . [ 119 ] 70.3 % of Area C ( 40.5 % of the West Bank ) is off limit to Palestinian construction and development . These areas include areas under jurisdiction of Israeli settlements , closed military zones , nature reserves and national parks and areas designated by Israel as `` state land '' . [ 121 ] There are about 330,000 Israelis living in settlements in Area C , [ 122 ] in the Judea and Samaria Area . Although Area C is under martial law , Israelis living there are judged in Israeli civil courts . [ 123 ] Cities in the West Bank Cities in the Gaza Strip",
