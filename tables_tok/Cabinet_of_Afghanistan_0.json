From July 2002 until the presidential elections in October 2004 , the Transitional Administration governed Afghanistan .",
  "uid": "Cabinet_of_Afghanistan_0",
  "intro": "The Cabinet of Afghanistan is made of the heads of all the government ministries. The president selects the members of cabinet with the approval of the National Assembly. Candidates for a ministerial position must be an Afghan citizen, be at least 35 years of age and have higher education. Ministers, unlike the president and vice presidents, can have citizenship of another country, but the Wolesi Jirga has in the past rejected ministers for the reason of having dual citizenship."
