  "intro": "The 2012 BC Lions season was the 55th season for the team in the Canadian Football League and their 59th overall. The Lions finished the season in 1st place in the West Division for the second consecutive year with a 13-5 record. The Lions attempted to repeat as Grey Cup champions for the first time in franchise history, but lost the West Final to the Calgary Stampeders. The Lions also began the season with a new head coach for the first time since 2003, after long-time head coach Wally Buono resigned to focus on his duties as general manager."
