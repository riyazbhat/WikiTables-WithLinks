  "intro": "The 2002 Nokia Brier was the Canadian men's curling championship. It was held from March 9 to 17, 2002 at the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta. It was won by the Albertan foursome headed by Randy Ferbey. Ferbey threw third stones throughout the tournament while his mate (third) David Nedohin threw skip (or fourth) stones. The other two members of the team were second Scott Pfeifer and lead Marcel Rocque. The Ferbey team beat the young Ontario foursome of John Morris, Joe Frans, Craig Savill, and Brent Laing by a score of 9-4. The game's pivotal moment came when Ferbey scored four points in the fifth end to break open an otherwise even and low-scoring game. Third place in the tournament went to the team skipped by New Brunswick's Russ Howard, while fourth place was taken by Saskatchewan's Scott Bitz. Absent from the event were many of the top teams in the country who had boycotted the Brier in favour of the Grand Slam of Curling series, protesting the lack of prize money."
