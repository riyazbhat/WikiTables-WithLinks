  "intro": "Ukraine competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from July 27 to August 12, 2012. This was the nation's fifth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine sent a total of 238 athletes, split equally between men and women, to compete in 21 sports. Ukraine left London with a total of 19 Olympic medals (5 gold, 4 silver, and 10 bronze), their lowest in Summer Olympic history since their debut in 1996. Five of these medals were awarded to the team in boxing; three each in athletics and sprint canoeing, and two each in fencing, shooting, and weightlifting. Two Ukrainian athletes won more than a single Olympic medal, while all of their competitors in sprint canoeing won at least a medal. For the first time in its history, Ukraine did not win an Olympic medal in archery. Among the nation's medalists were \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer Yana Shemyakina and the women's quadruple sculls team, led by Yana Dementyeva, who both won Ukraine's first Olympic gold medals in their respective events. Sprint canoer Inna Osypenko, who won two silver in London, became one of the most successful Ukrainian athletes in history, with a total of four Olympic medals. Meanwhile, Yuriy Cheban won the coveted gold medal in the men's sprint canoe singles, in addition to his bronze from Beijing. Vasyl Lomachenko became the first Ukrainian boxer and twelfth in history to claim two Olympic titles. Sabre fencer Olha Kharlan defeated the reigning champion Mariel Zagunis from the United States to win the bronze medal."
