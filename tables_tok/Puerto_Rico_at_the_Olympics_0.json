  "intro": "Puerto Rico first participated at the Olympic Games in 1948, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then. Puerto Rico has also participated in the Winter Olympic Games since 1984, but missed the Games of 2006, 2010, and 2014. Puerto Rican athletes have won a total of nine medals. Six medals were won in boxing, one in athletics, one in tennis, and one in wrestling. The Puerto Rican national baseball team won a bronze medal at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, but that medal is not counted among Puerto Rico's Olympic medals totals because baseball was only an exhibition sport during those games. The National Olympic Committee for Puerto Rico was created in 1948 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year."
