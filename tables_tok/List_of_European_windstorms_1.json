It moved rapidly towards the United Kingdom , deepening to 960 hPa ( 28 inHg ) on 8 November . While Becky was making landfall on Cornwall on 9 November , a low-pressure area over Nova Scotia was named Carmen . By 10 November , Becky had weakened and become more elongated , Carmen had moved offshore and began strengthening . On 11 November , Becky had been absorbed by Cyclone Anneli and Carmen had rapidly deepened to 965 hPa ( 28.5 inHg ) . Carmen strengthened slightly on 12 November , while centred just offshore Aberdeen , Scotland . On 13 November , it was centred over Scandinavia . It had split into two vortexes by that time . It began moving rapidly to the northeast , and moved out of the Free University of Berlin 's tracking charts on 16 November",

Up to 90 mm ( 3.5 in ) fell in 24 hours , flooding , landslides and closing roads in Nordland and Troms . Carl ( DMI ) Ev ( FUB ) - 14-15 March .
