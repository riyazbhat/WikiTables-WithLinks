  "intro": "The following is a list of all albums that have spent at least 100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart as published by the Official Charts Company (OCC). The chart comprises a top 100 from August 1981 to 1988 and since 1994, a top 75 before this (and from 1988 to 1994) from 1978 and various lengths before this from July 1956. Re-releases - such as remasters, re-issues, deluxe versions or anniversary editions - are treated together unless the re-released version differs significantly from the original (for example, it has been re-recorded or remixed). This list does not include compilation albums by various artists, which have been excluded from the UK Albums Chart since 1989. Soundtracks are still included if they are an original cast performance or if all tracks are performed by the same artist. The top three are all compilation albums, headed by Queen's Greatest Hits which has spent 872 weeks in the top 100 (593 of them in the top 75) as an individual album and a further 92 as part of a box set with Greatest Hits II and Greatest Hits III called The Platinum Collection. Excluding multiple album box sets, ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits has the most weeks at 910 (582 in the top 75). The most weeks for a studio album is 815 for Rumours by Fleetwood Mac (571 in the top 75) which charted every year from its release in 1977 until 1989 and in fifteen different years since then. Amy Winehouse's 2006 album Back to Black has the most weeks for a post-2000 release, charting for 408 weeks to date (293 in the top 75), though this total includes 55 weeks for the deluxe edition and 1 week for the box set that includes Back to Black and Winehouse's debut album Frank. The original soundtrack of South Pacific has the most weeks at number 1, with 115. The most weeks by an album not reaching number 1 is 534 for Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd and the most weeks by an album not reaching the top 10 is 130 for Blue Lines by Massive Attack. Dire Straits, Michael Jackson and U2 jointly hold the record for most albums to reach 100 weeks on chart, with five each."
