  "intro": "There are currently 71 living recipients of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is bestowed upon any member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. Of the 71 living recipients, two earned their Medals of Honor in World War II, five in the Korean War, 49 in the Vietnam War, 14 in the War in Afghanistan and one in the War in Iraq. One earned his medal while serving in the U.S. Air Force, 50 in the U.S. Army, 12 in the U.S. Marine Corps, and eight in the U.S. Navy. The oldest recipient is Charles H. Coolidge, aged 98, whereas the youngest is Kyle Carpenter, aged 30. Two medal holders are still on active duty in the U.S. military, War in Afghanistan soldiers William D. Swenson and Matthew O. Williams of the U.S. Army. Among the recipients are former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and three retired generals: Patrick Henry Brady and Robert F. Foley of the Army and James E. Livingston of the Marine Corps."
