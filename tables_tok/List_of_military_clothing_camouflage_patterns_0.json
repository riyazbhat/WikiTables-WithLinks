Military camouflage is the use of camouflage by a military force to protect personnel and equipment from observation by enemy forces. Textile patterns for uniforms have multiple functions, including camouflage, identifying friend from foe, and esprit de corps. The list is organized by pattern; only patterned textiles are shown. It includes current and past issue patterns, with dates; users may include armed, paramilitary, police, firefighting, search and rescue, counter-insurgency/counter-terrorism and other security forces and emergency services."
