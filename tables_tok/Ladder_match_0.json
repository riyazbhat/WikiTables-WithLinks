[ 49 ] Another featured Jeff Hardy retaining his World Heavyweight Championship against CM Punk in Denver , Co in 2009 . [ 50 ] Three ladder matches took place at consecutive house shows in 2006 , where each saw Jeff Hardy defend his Intercontinental Championship . The first of these three saw Shelton Benjamin , Johnny Nitro , and Carlito as contenders . The next two nights did not feature Benjamin as he was too injured to participate . Similar to a Stairway to Hell match , during Triple H and Kevin Nash 's ladder match , a sledgehammer was hung above the ring . The first participant to retrieve it could use it as a weapon . The only way to have won was by pinfall or submission . Participant list",

  "intro": "A ladder match is a type of match in professional wrestling, most commonly one where an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item. The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match, as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder. However, there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match, such as striking the opponent with the item (see Bam Bam Bigelow Vs. Scott Hall taser match, where one must strike the opponent with the taser, regardless of who retrieved the taser first). Ladder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually containing a contract for a future championship match) or championship belts hung above the ring. Ladder matches and their variants (such as TLC matches and Full Metal Mayhem) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item (such as a stolen title belt or the paperwork for the contractual services of a manager). Ladder matches are almost always fought under no disqualification rules."
