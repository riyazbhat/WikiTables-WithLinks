MTV.com describes him as a motivated young man with a quick wit and an even quicker tongue , and a class clown who uses his sense of humor to provide comic relief for his friends . He is also said to have a tenacious work ethic and drive , and is a positive influence on those in his life . The first housemate he greeted was Frankie , and the two of them first walked into the house together . They were perhaps the closest with one another during their stay there"
