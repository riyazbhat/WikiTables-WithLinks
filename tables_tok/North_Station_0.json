  "section_title": "History -- North Station",
  "section_text": "North Station in the early 1960s Until the 1960s , the station was the hub for long-distance B & M service to multiple locales north and west of Boston , usually in conjunction with other railroads . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Service cutbacks began in the 1950s , and service soon dwindled down to commuter rail operations . The last intercity service to Portland , Maine and to north of Concord , New Hampshire ended on January 4 , 1965 . [ 1 ] By this point , the intercity train itineraries consisted of self-propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars , often just one or two cars for the trip . Single commuter-oriented daily round trips on these routes to Concord and Dover , New Hampshire lasted until June 30 , 1967 . [ 1 ] Limited MBTA Commuter Rail service to Concord was run from January 28 , 1980 to March 1 , 1981 as part of a federally funded experiment . [ 1 ]",
