This dog had a bite history and had been sent for training/rehabilitation for 2 - 3 months , but it did n't work . He was adopted out two more times , and returned , before being adopted to the victim 's family . Because of this death , Virginia passed a law requiring disclosure of a dog 's bite history upon adoption"
