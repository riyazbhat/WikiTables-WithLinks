See also : Offshore wind power , List of offshore wind farms , and Lists of offshore wind farms by country Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy , with the first offshore wind farm ( Vindeby ) being installed in Denmark in 1991 . As of 2010 , there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Ireland , the Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and the United Kingdom , with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW . More than 100 GW ( or 100,000 MW ) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe . The European Wind Energy Association has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030 . [ 33 ] As of 2017 [ update ] , The Walney Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 MW , followed by the London Array ( 630 MW ) also in the UK .",

  "intro": "A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Wind farms vary in size from a small number of turbines to several hundred wind turbines covering an extensive area. Wind farms can be either onshore or offshore. Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the largest wind farm in the world, Gansu Wind Farm in China had a capacity of over 6,000 MW by 2012, with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. As of September 2018, the 659 MW Walney Wind Farm in the UK is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. Wind farms tend to have much less impact on the environment than many other power stations. Onshore wind farms are also criticized for their visual impact and impact on the landscape, as typically they need to take up more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to industrialization of the countryside, habitat loss, and a drop in tourism. Critics have linked wind farms to adverse health effects (see wind turbine syndrome). Wind farms have also been criticized for interfering with radar, radio and television reception."
