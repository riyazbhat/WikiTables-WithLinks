During the Dutch occupation of Cochin they made several changes in the city . The Dutch reduced the area of the old Portuguese town , reduced the fort and destroyed most of the public buildings built by the Portuguese . They developed the harbour , the piers , many merchants houses and warehouses in Cochin",
