        "Committed suicide by hanging after murdering his wife and niece . The latter was also decapitated and eviscerated in a manner strongly similar to 26 unsolved murders of women in Florida , starting in 1973 , the year Brandt moved to the state . Brandt was later considered the culprit in one of these murders , due to his strong resemblance to a suspect who was filmed by a traffic camera near the place where one body was found . He could not be officially tied to the other crimes due to lack of evidence . Previously , when he was 13 years old in 1971 , he attempted to murder his whole family with a gun , for no apparent reason . His mother ( who was pregnant ) died in this attack , but his father survived , and his sister escaped",
