        "Justin Alleyn designed Ewell 's Catholic church in 1962 , but Catholic worship in the town predates this by 25 years : St Matthias ' Church at Worcester Park founded a mission church in 1937 . A parish was created in 1941 . A landmark on the A240 Kingston Road because of its slim brick-built campanile , the brick and concrete church 's walls have an imaginative zigzag design with east-facing stained glass in each section . The interior layout was altered in 2003",
