  "section_text": "The bokuseki style developed from Song Dynasty calligraphy . It was brought from China to Japan , together with Zen Buddhism , starting with Eisai in 1191 . [ 98 ] Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan ; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries . [ 97 ] Later bokuseki became part of the zen practice and served as meditation help . [ 95 ] They were often mounted on hanging scrolls , and displayed in temples and tea rooms . [ 94 ] [ 97 ] [ 99 ] The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Riky\u016b considered them crucial to the tea ceremony in the sense that they put the participants in the right frame-of-mind . [ 97 ] Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods . [ 98 ] Dait\u014d Kokushi and Mus\u014d Soseki , both from the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism , were the most famous bokuseki masters of the time . [ 98 ] The bokuseki style is present in a variety of Zen genres such as Buddhist sermons or Dharma talks ( h\u014dgo ) , certificates of enlightenment ( inkaj\u014d ) , death verses ( yuige ) , gatha verses ( geju ) , poetry [ nb 8 ] ( shi ) , letters , names and titles given to a monk by his master ( jigo ) , exhortory sermons ( shid\u014dgo ) , gakuji , [ nb 9 ] inscriptions on Zen paintings ( san ) and Zen circles . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 101 ] There are 23 bokuseki National Treasures of various types including inkaj\u014d , h\u014dgo , letters and yuige . They date from the 12th to 14th centuries and have been mounted on hanging scrolls . [ 4 ]",
