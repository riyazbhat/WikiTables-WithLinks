In addition , there is a peal of eight bells by Taylor 's of Loughborough . The church , which was started in 1441 by Carthusian monks , incorporates several Norman features including the north doorway . The register commences in the year 560 . Near the altar is a stone seat , known as a 'frid ' for those , especially criminals , who took sanctuary in the church . The church includes monuments to Sir Henry Fitzroger and his wife who died in 1388 and Frances Lady Waldegrave 1879 . The Waldegrave family have owned Chewton from 1553 , but did not live in the village until the 1860s . Wade and Wade in their 1929 book Somerset described the church as a singularly interesting church , which possesses one of the most stately towers in the county",

He also pegs three of the smaller towers in the western part of Somerset : Combe Florey about 1499 ; Fivehead , around 1505 ; and Langford Budville , 1509 . The end of the Perpendicular period in architecture coincides with construction of Ruishton , 1533 ; Chedzoy , 1539 ; and Batcombe and Chewton Mendip , around 1540 .",

The paragraphs and descriptions below describe features of some of these towers. The organization follows Peter Poyntz-Wright's scheme for grouping the towers by what he understands to be roughly the date and group of mason-architects who built them. Poyntz-Wright's scheme came under criticism in the 1980s."
