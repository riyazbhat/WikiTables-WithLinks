  "section_title": "Hall of Fame/Throwback",
  "section_text": "Occasionally Rock Sound adds a new album to its Hall of Fame . The main criteria is thought to be influence \u2013 even within a particular genre \u2013 and for that reason many of the albums have been commercially successful as well as critically successful because they have then gone on to influence large numbers of bands or the music scene . Thus this differs from the Yearly Top Albums lists which do not take influence into account . In each article there is normally an interview with band members , a commentary on the album 's release , a look at its initial success , and reaction from other musicians as well . In some of the newer issues this section had been renamed to `` Throwback '' .",
  "uid": "Rock_Sound_0",
  "intro": "Rock Sound is a British magazine which covers rock music. The magazine aims at being more underground and less commercial, while also giving coverage to more well-known acts. It generally focuses on pop punk, post-hardcore, metalcore, punk, emo, hardcore, heavy metal and extreme metal genres of rock music, rarely covering indie rock music at all. The tag-line For those who like their music loud, extreme and non-conformist is sometimes used. Although primarily aimed at the British market, the magazine is also sold in Australia, Canada and the United States."
