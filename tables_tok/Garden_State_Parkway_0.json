Townsend Shoemaker Holly picnic area One of the objectives of the parkway was to become a state park its entire length , and its users would enjoy park-like aesthetics with minimal intrusion of urban scenery . Along the ride , users were permitted to stop and picnic along the roadway to further enjoy the relaxation qualities the parkway had to offer . All picnic areas had tall trees that provided shade and visual isolation from the roadway . Grills , benches , running water and restrooms were provided . Over time as the parkway transformed into a road of commerce , the picnic areas were closed for a variety of reasons . Their ramp terminals became insufficient to accommodate the high-speed mainline traffic and in addition to the decreasing number of users , the picnic areas were becoming more effective as maintenance yards and were converted as such or closed altogether . [ 125 ] The one remaining picnic area , John B. Townsend Shoemaker Holly , is closed from dusk to dawn . Posted signs within the picnic area prohibit fires and camping . [ 125 ] There were ten operational picnic areas :",

  "intro": "The Garden State Parkway (GSP) is a limited-access toll parkway that stretches the length of New Jersey from the state's southernmost tip at Cape May to the New York line at Montvale. Its name refers to New Jersey's nickname, the Garden State. The parkway's official, but unsigned, designation is Route 444. At its north end, the road becomes the Garden State Parkway Connector, a component of the New York State Thruway system that connects to the Thruway mainline in Ramapo. At a length of , the parkway is the longest highway in the state. Most of the highway has a posted speed limit of . The parkway is primarily for passenger vehicle use; trucks weighing over are prohibited north of exit 105. The parkway was constructed between 1946 and 1957 to connect suburban northern New Jersey with resort areas along the Atlantic coast and to alleviate traffic on traditional north-south routes running through each town center, such as U.S. Route 1 (US 1), US 9, and Route 35. During planning, the road was originally designated as the Route 4 Parkway. Unofficially, the parkway has two sections: the metropolitan section north of the Raritan River and the shore section between the Raritan River and Cape May. Most of the metropolitan section is like any other expressway built in the 1950s through heavily populated areas. The shore section parallels US 9 and runs through unspoiled wilderness in the New Jersey Pine Barrens."
