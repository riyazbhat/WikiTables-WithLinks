  "section_text": "On November 4 , 1775 , the Continental Congress resolved that on January 1 , 1776 , the Continental Army , exclusive of artillery and extra regiments , was to consist of 27 infantry regiments . The troops were to be enlisted to serve until December 31 , 1776 . [ 64 ] The quota of regiments assigned to the states was 1 from Pennsylvania , 3 from New Hampshire , 16 from Massachusetts , 2 from Rhode Island , and 5 from Connecticut . [ 65 ] Each regiment was to have an official establishment of 728 officers and men in eight companies . [ 66 ] The regiments were to receive numbers instead of names . For the campaign of 1776 Massachusetts was to provide the 3d , 4th , 6th , 7th , 12th , 13th , 14th , 15th , 16th , 18th , 21st , 23d , 24th , 25th , 26th , and 27th Continental Regiments . The reduction of the Massachusetts Line from an establishment of 16,468 officers and men in 275 companies to an establishment of 11,648 officers and men in 128 companies required a difficult reorganization . [ 67 ] The numbered Continental regiments raised in Massachusetts were widely scattered in the campaign of 1776 . In April , following the British evacuation of Boston , five regiments ( the 6th , 14th , 16th , 18th , and 27th ) were ordered to remain in Massachusetts , four of them occupying Boston . Three of these regiments ( the 14th , 16th , and 27th ) joined the Main Army in July . The 6th and 18th regiments joined the Northern Army in August , and never rejoined the Main Army . Of the eleven regiments that moved to New York City in April , three regiments ( the 15th , 24th , and 25th ) were ordered to Canada as reinforcements . One of these regiments ( the 15th ) rejoined the Main Army in November , and served at Trenton and Princeton . The 24th and 25th regiments , that had served in the Northern theater , also rejoined the Main Army in November , but marched directly to the army 's winter quarters at Morristown , New Jersey . Finally , the 7th Continental Regiment , which served in Parsons ' Brigade , was assigned to the Highlands Department in November . [ 68 ]",
  "uid": "Massachusetts_Line_1",
  "intro": "The Massachusetts Line was the name given to those units within the Continental Army that were assigned to Massachusetts at various times by the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. These, together with similar contingents from the other twelve states, formed the Continental Line. Line regiments were assigned to a particular state, which was then financially responsible for the maintenance (staffing and supplying) of the regiment. The concept of the line was also particularly important in relation to the promotion of commissioned officers. Officers of the Continental Army below the rank of brigadier general were ordinarily ineligible for promotion except in the line of their own state. The size of the Massachusetts Line varied from as many as 27 active regiments (at the outset of the war) to four (at its end). For most of the war after the Siege of Boston (April 1775 to March 1776) almost all of these units were deployed outside Massachusetts, serving as far north as Quebec City, as far west as present-day central Upstate New York, and as far south as Yorktown, Virginia. Massachusetts line troops were involved in most of the war's major battles north of Chesapeake Bay, and were present at the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781. General officers of the line included Major Generals Artemas Ward, William Heath, and Benjamin Lincoln, and Brigadier Generals John Glover and John Nixon."
