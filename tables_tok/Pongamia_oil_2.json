  "section_text": "Pongamia oil is extracted from the seeds by expeller pressing , cold pressing , or solvent extraction . The oil is yellowish-orange to brown in color . It is toxic and will induce nausea and vomiting if eaten , but it is used in many traditional remedies . [ citation needed ] It has a high content of triglycerides , and its disagreeable taste and odor are due to bitter flavonoid constituents including karanjin , pongamol , tannin and karanjachromene . [ 2 ] Millettia pinnata has a number of different varieties but little research has been published on the differences between them . [ 3 ] This combined with variances in soil and weather can change the specific composition of Pongamia oil . Typically Pongamia oil is composed of the following fatty acids : [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Fatty acid Nomenclature Percentage Palmitic C16:0 3.7% \u2013 7.9% Stearic C18:0 2.4% \u2013 8.9% Oleic C18:1 44.5% \u2013 71.3% Linoleic C18:2 10.8% \u2013 18.3% Linolenic C18:3 2.6% Arachidic C20:0 2.2% \u2013 4.7% Eicosenoic C20:1 9.5% \u2013 12.4% Behenic C22:0 4.2% \u2013 5.3% Lignoceric C24:0 1.1% \u2013 3.5% The physical properties of crude pongamia oil are as follows : [ 4 ]",

  "intro": "Pongamia oil is derived from the seeds of the Millettia pinnata tree, which is native to tropical and temperate Asia. Millettia pinnata, also known as Pongamia pinnata or Pongamia glabra, is common throughout Asia and thus has many different names in different languages, many of which have come to be used in English to describe the seed oil derived from M. pinnata; Pongamia is often used as the generic name for the tree and is derived from the genus the tree was originally placed in. Other names for this oil include honge oil, kanuga oil, karanja oil, and pungai oil."
