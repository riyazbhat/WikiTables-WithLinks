  "intro": "Romania competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This nation has competed at the Summer Olympic Games since its official debut in 1924, missing only two editions, including the 1948 Summer Olympics. Despite being London's third Olympic Games, this is the first time the Romanian team has competed in London. The Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee (Romanian: Comitetul Olimpic \u0219i Sportiv Rom\u00e2n, COSR) sent a total of 103 athletes to the Games, 54 men and 49 women, to compete in 14 sports. Romania left London with a total of 9 medals (2 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze), beating the number of medals won in Beijing by one. This performance was considered the nation's worst at an Olympic Games since 1964, based on the gold medal standings. Three of the medals were awarded to the team in artistic gymnastics, two each in judo, and weightlifting, and one each in fencing and shooting. Romania did not win an Olympic medal in rowing for the first time since 1976, and in athletics for the first time since 1980. Among the nation's medallists were gymnasts Sandra Izba\u0219a and C\u0103t\u0103lina Ponor, who both won two medals for their individual final exercises (vault and floor). The women's artistic gymnastics team, led by Ponor and Izba\u0219a, also managed to repeat its bronze medal in the all-around event. Rifle shooter Alin Moldoveanu became the first Romanian man to claim the gold medal in a shooting event in 12 years. Meanwhile, Rare\u0219 Dumitrescu, who missed out of the bronze medal in men's individual sabre, led his team to win the silver in men's team sabre fencing competition."
