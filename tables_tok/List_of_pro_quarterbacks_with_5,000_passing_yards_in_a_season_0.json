  "intro": "Passing for 5,000 yards in a single regular season is a rare achievement in the National Football League (NFL). Eight different quarterbacks have accomplished the feat, Dan Marino was the first when he set an NFL record with 5,084 yards passing in 1984. Marino's record remained intact for 24 years, and for over a decade after his 1999 retirement. Peyton Manning currently holds the record with 5,477 passing yards in 2013, with Drew Brees being exactly one yard short of this mark. Drew Brees is the only NFL quarterback to reach 5,000 yards more than once, having done so five times. In 2011 three different players, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Matt Stafford threw for over 5,000 yards. Patrick Mahomes and Ben Roethlisberger both accomplished it in 2018. NFL quarterbacks have passed for 5,000 yards in a season 12 times. However, only two of these quarterbacks also threw for 50 touchdowns in the same season, Peyton Manning in 2013 and Patrick Mahomes in 2018. Despite the rarity of a 5,000 yard season, only three quarterbacks were named MVP the year of their 5,000 season, Marino, Manning, and Mahomes. Matt Stafford, Ben Roethlisberger, and Jameis Winston are the only quarterbacks to not be selected to the Pro Bowl the same year of their 5,000 season. Jameis Winston accomplished this feat most recently, passing for over 5,000 yards in 2019."
