  "intro": "Muni Metro is a light rail/streetcar system serving San Francisco, California, United States. Operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), a part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Muni Metro served an average of 166,900 passengers per weekday in the second quarter of 2013, making it the third-busiest light rail system in the United States. Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, and five of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are remnants of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT&T Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down the eastern side of the city to the city line. The system consists of nine subway stations and twenty-four surface stations with high-level 34-inch (860 mm) platforms that allow for level boarding. There are also eighty-seven surface stops whose features vary anywhere between low-level platforms, traffic islands, and markers painted on nearby utility poles. Four stations, from Embarcadero to Civic Center, are shared with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The oldest stations are Forest Hill and West Portal, built in 1918, while the newest stations were opened as part as the Third Street Light Rail Project in 2007."
