  "intro": "Campus SuperStar is a Singaporean reality television singing competition to find new singing talent, contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. The show began on 2 January 2006 and is broadcast on MediaCorp Channel U. It is a spin-off of Project SuperStar, and contestants comprise students from secondary schools, junior colleges and institutes of technical education. The concept of the series is to find aspiring singers studying in secondary schools, junior colleges and institutes of technical education and put them together to compete for the Campus SuperStar title where the winner is determined by the judges and viewers. Winners chosen by judges through judges' score and viewers through telephone, Internet (gift-to-vote), and SMS text voting were Ng Chee Yang, Shawn Tok, Jarod Lee and Bonnie Loo. Winners receive a two-year management contract with MediaCorp and a cash prize ($2,000 for season 1-3, and $5000 for season 4). Season 4 winner also receives an opportunity to perform with Mandopop singer Della Ding Dang in Glass Anatomy the Musical. The series employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances.

The current season's judging panel consists of singer Jim Lim, lyricist Xiaohan and radio personality Dennis Chew. MediaCorp hosts Pornsak and Lee Teng are the emcee of the show."
