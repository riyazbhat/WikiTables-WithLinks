  "section_text": "Major rivers of Argentina : Important rivers of Argentina in terms of length and quantity of water conveyed and discharged include the Parana , Uruguay , and the Negro rivers . The two largest rivers , the Paran\u00e1 River and the Uruguay River originate in Brazil . The Uruguay River runs north to south and forms a border with Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay . The Parana River together with the Uruguay river form the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary . Only a few of the Argentine rivers such as the Futaleuf\u00fa River flow to the Pacific , while the majority of rivers originate on eastern slopes of the Andes and run towards the Atlantic ocean . Argentina is home to at least three major endorheic basins or closed water drainage basins e.g . water does not flow to the ocean . Both the northwest and southwest pampas basins in the dry pampas areas of Argentina and the Meseta Somuncura in the Patagonia region of Argentina are endorheic basins . Notable river basins under this classification include the Desaguadero River basin which has great hydroelectric and irrigation significance . In times of great precipitation , its waters can actually reach the sea . The Desaguadero River basin includes the following tributaries : J\u00e1chal , Mendoza , Tunuy\u00e1n , Diamante and Atuel .
