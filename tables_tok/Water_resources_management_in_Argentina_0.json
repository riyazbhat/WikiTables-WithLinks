  "section_text": "Major rivers of Argentina : Important rivers of Argentina in terms of length and quantity of water conveyed and discharged include the Parana , Uruguay , and the Negro rivers . The two largest rivers , the Paran\u00e1 River and the Uruguay River originate in Brazil . The Uruguay River runs north to south and forms a border with Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay . The Parana River together with the Uruguay river form the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary . Only a few of the Argentine rivers such as the Futaleuf\u00fa River flow to the Pacific , while the majority of rivers originate on eastern slopes of the Andes and run towards the Atlantic ocean . Argentina is home to at least three major endorheic basins or closed water drainage basins e.g . water does not flow to the ocean . Both the northwest and southwest pampas basins in the dry pampas areas of Argentina and the Meseta Somuncura in the Patagonia region of Argentina are endorheic basins . Notable river basins under this classification include the Desaguadero River basin which has great hydroelectric and irrigation significance . In times of great precipitation , its waters can actually reach the sea . The Desaguadero River basin includes the following tributaries : J\u00e1chal , Mendoza , Tunuy\u00e1n , Diamante and Atuel .

  "intro": "Water resources management (WRM) functions in Argentina are handled by multiple institutions operating at the national, provincial, and river basin level, with a variety of functions and jurisdictions. On the national level, the National Institute for Water and the Environment (INA) and the National Water and Sanitation Utility (AySA) are charged with the duties of researching, water resources preservation, developing services, and implementing water projects. Connectivity to water in urban settings is quite good in Argentina, but rural communities lag far behind that of less developed nations. This problem is made worse by one of the highest levels of per capita usage in the world at around 500 L/day. Large rivers and aquifers represent the main source of drinking water supplies and they are facing serious water pollution problems from industrial effluents, urbanization, and harmful agriculture practices. Many other challenges persist throughout the country and most are regionally focused with varying degrees because Argentina is divided into many different climatic regions. Some of the critical issues are identified as an inadequate regulatory and institutional framework, inter-sectoral conflict, limited capacity in water management at the central and provincial levels, and high risk for flooding in urban and rural areas."
