  "intro": "The Voice: la plus belle voix (season 1) was the first season of the French reality singing competition, created by media tycoon John de Mol. It was aired from February 2012 to May 2012 on TF1. One of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner. The coaches were Florent Pagny, Jenifer, Louis Bertignac and Garou. The First Season ended on May 12, 2012, Stephan Rizon was declared the winner."
