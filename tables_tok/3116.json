  "section_text": "1997\u20131999 reprint of Rakhine Razawin Thit Though Arakanese chronicles may have been written circa the 14th century , the earliest extant manuscripts date only from the 18th century . Most of Mrauk-U 's historical works did not survive the burning of the royal library by the Konbaung forces in 1785 . [ 71 ] Only portions escaped the indiscriminate destruction . An Arakanese monk tried to salvage the wreckage as much as he could by promptly compiling the Dhanyawaddy Yazawin . He completed it in 1788 but the chronicle may not be as reliable as it is `` a third-hand piece of work '' . Colonial period scholars had to piece together the extant portions of Maha Razawin ( 148 angas or 1776 palm-leaves ) , Do We 's Rakhine Razawin ( 48 angas / 576 leaves ) , Saya Mi 's Maha Razawin ( 24 angas / 288 leaves ) . [ 4 ] In the late 20th century , historian San Tha Aung could confirm only eight of the supposed 48 historical works of Arakanese history . Even of the extant eight , he was unsure of the reliability of the information prior to 1000 CE . [ 67 ]",
