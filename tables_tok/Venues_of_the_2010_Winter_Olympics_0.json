  "section_text": "Whistler Olympic Park ski jumps at Callaghan Valley The Richmond Olympic Oval The largest competition venue was Canada Hockey Place , with a capacity of just under 19,000 spectators . For the first time , Olympic games were played on a narrower NHL-sized ice rink , measuring 61 by 26 metres ( 200 ft \u00d7 85 ft ) , instead of the international size of 61 m \u00d7 30 m ( 200 ft \u00d7 98 ft ) . This change saved an expected $ 10 million ( CAD ) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games . [ 12 ] This arena , as well as the second-largest venue of Vancouver 2010 , Pacific Coliseum , were pre-existing and required minimal renovation in preparation for the Olympics . Of the newly constructed venues for the Games , the Whistler Sliding Centre was the largest , with space for 12,000 spectators to observe the luge , skeleton and bobsled events . Three venues used in the Games were outside Vancouver and Whistler : Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver , the Richmond Olympic Oval in Richmond , and UBC Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre on the University Endowment Lands",
