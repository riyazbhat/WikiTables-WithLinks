  "section_text": "See also : History of South America In the 1960s and 1970s , the governments of Argentina , Brazil , Chile , and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships . These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of political prisoners , many of whom were tortured and/or killed ( on inter-state collaboration , see Operation Condor ) . Economically , they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies . They placed their own actions within the United States Cold War doctrine of `` National Security '' against internal subversion . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Peru suffered from an internal conflict ( see T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and Shining Path ) . Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common , but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent , and democratic rule is widespread now . Allegations of corruption remain common , and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents , although normal civilian succession has continued . International indebtedness became a notable problem , as most recently illustrated by Argentina 's default in the early 21st century . In recent years , South American governments have drifted to the left , with socialist leaders being elected in Chile , Bolivia , Brazil , Venezuela , and a leftist president in Argentina and Uruguay . Despite the move to the left , South America is still largely capitalist . With the founding of the Union of South American Nations , South America has started down the road of economic integration , with plans for political integration in the European Union style .",

  "intro": "The prehistory of the Americas (North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an Ice Age. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from the people of the Old World until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Iceland led by Leif Erikson and with the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via Beringia, the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the Bering Strait. Small lithic stage peoples followed megafauna like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname big-game hunters. Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast. Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as Iroquois on North America and Pirah\u00e3 of South America. These cultures later developed into civilizations. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered[citation needed] advanced or civilized include Norte Chico, Cahokia, Zapotec, Toltec, Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Chimor, Mixtec, Moche, Mississippian, Puebloan, Totonac, Teotihuacan, Huastec people, Pur\u00e9pecha, Izapa, Mazatec, Muisca, and the Inca."
