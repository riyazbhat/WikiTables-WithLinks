  "intro": "These are a series of Neo Geo's special lists of games, which includes a list of: unlicensed (official Neo Geo games that were published without permission of SNK), prototyped (a series of games for the Neo Geo made from famous companies that were not fully realized), and homebrewed titles (i.e. those games that are created over the years 2000 from independent developers and companies). Every list is sortable by title, developer, publisher (not included in subparagraph of Homebrewed titles Not published) and release year. All the games (with the exception of three homebrewed titles) were published both for MVS and AES systems. The prototype and homebrew titles released for the Neo Geo CD platform can be found in the corresponding article."
