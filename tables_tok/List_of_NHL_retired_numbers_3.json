  "section_title": "Former retired numbers",
  "section_text": "It is very rare for a team to reissue a retired number , and usually requires a special circumstance , such as a number being requested for a family member ( such as Bobby Hull asking the Phoenix Coyotes to allow his son Brett to wear Bobby 's number 9 ) , [ 87 ] or the player for whom the number was retired coming out of retirement himself ( such as Mario Lemieux ) . In cases of franchise relocation , the handling of existing retired numbers is at the discretion of team management . They may decide to continue honouring the retired numbers , such as the Dallas Stars and Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes , or they may choose to make a `` fresh start '' and reissue the numbers , as the Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes have done . The Hurricanes have an unusual exception with regards to Gordie Howe 's number 9 . While the Hurricanes have not made any formal recognition of the Hartford Whalers ' retirement of the number , they have kept the number out of circulation since their 1997 relocation . [ 77 ] The Red Wings and Larry Aurie 's number 6 are also something of a unique situation , as the number was officially retired , then un-retired so that his cousin , Cummy Burton , could wear it , much as the Jets/Coyotes did for the Hulls . It was then re-retired until 2000 , when the Red Wings ordered it removed from the NHL 's Official Guide and Record Book . Despite the unretirement , number 6 is still not available to be worn in Detroit .",

  "intro": "This is a complete list of numbers retired by the National Hockey League (NHL). A retired number is a jersey number that is taken out of circulation by a team as a way of honouring a former member of that team who wore that number; after the number's retirement, members of that team are not permitted to wear the number on their jerseys unless by permission of the original number holder. The first team to retire a number was the Toronto Maple Leafs, which retired Ace Bailey's number 6 on February 14, 1934, prior to an All-Star game organized in his honour. The NHL currently has 128 retired numbers, 3 pending number retirements, 7 former retirements, and 23 honoured numbers. Most of the numbers retired by the Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques were put back in circulation when those franchises relocated and became the Carolina Hurricanes and Colorado Avalanche\n, respectively, although the Hurricanes keep Gordie Howe's number 9 unofficially retired. The Minnesota North Stars' two retired numbers were carried over when that franchise relocated to become the Dallas Stars, and remain retired today. The Arizona Coyotes had a policy of retaining the numbers retired when the franchise was the Winnipeg Jets but reversed it after the Phoenix Coyotes were sold and became the Arizona Coyotes. Honoured numbers are similar to retired numbers, except that they remain available for use by other players. Presently, only the Calgary Flames, and the St. Louis Blues employ this designation. The Philadelphia Flyers have also unofficially retired number 31 in honour of goaltender Pelle Lindbergh since his death in 1985. Wayne Gretzky's number 99 has been retired league-wide in 2000, although the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings separately retired Gretzky's number. Upon joining the league in 2000, the Minnesota Wild had a ceremony retiring number 1 from circulation as a tribute to their fans."
