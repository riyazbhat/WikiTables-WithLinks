  "section_title": "Former retired numbers",
  "section_text": "It is very rare for a team to reissue a retired number , and usually requires a special circumstance , such as a number being requested for a family member ( such as Bobby Hull asking the Phoenix Coyotes to allow his son Brett to wear Bobby 's number 9 ) , [ 87 ] or the player for whom the number was retired coming out of retirement himself ( such as Mario Lemieux ) In cases of franchise relocation , the handling of existing retired numbers is at the discretion of team management . They may decide to continue honouring the retired numbers , such as the Dallas Stars and Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes , or they may choose to make a `` fresh start '' and reissue the numbers , as the Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes have done The Hurricanes have an unusual exception with regards to Gordie Howe 's number 9 . While the Hurricanes have not made any formal recognition of the Hartford Whalers ' retirement of the number , they have kept the number out of circulation since their 1997 relocation . [ 77 ] The Red Wings and Larry Aurie 's number 6 are also something of a unique situation , as the number was officially retired , then un-retired so that his cousin , Cummy Burton , could wear it , much as the Jets/Coyotes did for the Hulls . It was then re-retired until 2000 , when the Red Wings ordered it removed from the NHL 's Official Guide and Record Book . Despite the unretirement , number 6 is still not available to be worn in Detroit",
