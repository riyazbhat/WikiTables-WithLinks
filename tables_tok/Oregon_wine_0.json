  "intro": "The state of Oregon in the United States has established an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking fourth in the country behind California, Washington, and New York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to the cultivation of grapes; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making began in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s. American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state are the Willamette Valley AVA (with 6 nested-AVAs) and the Southern Oregon AVA with (5 nested-AVAs). Parts of the Columbia Gorge, Walla Walla Valley, and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon. Pinot noir and Pinot gris are the top two grapes grown, with over 59,452 short tons (53,934 t) harvested in 2016. Oregon winemakers sold just under 3.4 million cases in 2016. With 725 wineries in Oregon, a tourism industry has developed around wine tasting. Much of the tourism focuses on the wineries and tasting rooms in and around the Yamhill Valley southwest of Portland. Small towns in this area include often represent a specific AVA. Carlton, Oregon is situated within the Yamhill-Carlton AVA. It is estimated that enotourism contributed US$207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms."
