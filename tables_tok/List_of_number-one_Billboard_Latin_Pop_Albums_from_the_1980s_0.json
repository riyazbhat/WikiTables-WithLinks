  "intro": "Latin Pop Albums is a record chart published in Billboard magazine that features Latin music sales information. The Latin Pop Chart was the first of the Latin charts along with, Regional Mexican Albums and Tropical Albums, to be released from Billboard. The data is compiled by Nielsen SoundScan from a sample that includes music stores, music departments at electronics and department stores, Internet sales (both physical and digital) and verifiable sales from concert venues in the United States. The data for this chart was published every two weeks, unlike most Billboard charts. During the 1980s, there were 19 number-one albums in this chart, which was first published on June 29, 1985. The first album to peak at number one in the first year of publication was Reflexiones, by Mexican singer Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album and received a platinum certification in Mexico for sales of 250,000 units, Reflexiones spent 8 weeks at number one in 1985. Three other albums by Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9: Promesas, Siempre Contigo, and Soy As\u00ed also reached number-one on the chart. Un hombre solo by Spanish singer Julio Iglesias holds the record for having the most consecutive weeks at number-one. It won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 1988, defeating albums from veteran pop such as singers Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9, Danny Rivera, Yolandita Monge, and Emmanuel; the latter had two albums which peaked at number one on March 1987 with his albums Solo and Entre Lunas in May 1988. In addition, a compilation album related to the artist reached number-one in 1986. Primitive Love by the Miami Sound Machine peaked number-one on October 4, 1986 for six weeks and twenty-three on the Billboard 200."
