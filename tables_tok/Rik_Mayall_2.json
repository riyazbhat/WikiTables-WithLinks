  "intro": "Richard Michael Mayall (7 March 1958 - 9 June 2014) was an English comedian, actor and writer. Mayall formed a close partnership with Ade Edmondson while they were students at Manchester University, and was a pioneer of alternative comedy in the 1980s. Mayall starred in numerous cult classic sitcoms throughout his career, including The Young Ones, The Comic Strip Presents., Blackadder, Filthy Rich & Catflap, The New Statesman, Bottom and Believe Nothing. Mayall also starred in the comedy films Drop Dead Fred and Guest House Paradiso, and won a Primetime Emmy Award for his voice-over work in The Willows in Winter. His comedic style was described as energetic post-punk. He was also known as the narrator of the CGI children's show Jellabies. Mayall died suddenly on 9 June 2014 at the age of 56. BBC Television director Danny Cohen praised him as a truly brilliant comedian with a unique stage presence, whose fireball creativity and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars."
