He was elected Registrar in 1532 , but removed from office in 1552 for negligence : it was said that he had failed to record the required matters for a year to the great disworship of the university , and had procured means and ways to vex and trouble the university , such that he ought to be expelled rather than take any further profit or commodity . He refused to answer the charges against him . The result of the vote led to him quitting the room in a temper and punching the man sent by the Vice-Chancellor to restrain him . Caius was imprisoned but was released the following day after agreeing to apologise to the university and to pay a fine of fourpence . He was appointed Master of University College in 1561 . His writings included claims refuting Cambridge 's assertion that it was an older university than Oxford , alleging in reply that Oxford had been founded by Alfred the Great",

  "intro": "The Registrar of the University of Oxford is one of the senior officials of the university. According to its statutes, the Registrar acts as the head of the central administrative services, with responsibility for the management and professional development of their staff and for the development of other administrative support. He or she is also the principal adviser on strategic policy to the university's Vice-Chancellor and Council, its main decision-making body. The university regards the role as having a 550-year history, as there are references in the records to officials carrying out the duties of a registrar in the 15th century, though the list of Registrars published by the university in the 19th century begins with John London, who died in 1508. As the administrative requirements of the university have increased, so have the number of staff employed in the university administration under the Registrar. The university decided to give the role increased importance after this was recommended by a commission in 1922. As of 2015[update], there are 16 administrative sections for the university, and the heads of 12 of these report to the Registrar. About 4,000 of the university's staff of approximately 8,000 are under the Registrar's control. The current Registrar, Gill Aitken, took up her duties in September 2018. The previous Registrar, Ewan McKendrick, held the post from 1 January 2011; he is also Professor of English Private Law and was previously one of the university's Pro-Vice-Chancellors. His predecessor, Julie Maxton, was the first woman to hold the position; she was previously Dean of the Law School at the University of Auckland."
