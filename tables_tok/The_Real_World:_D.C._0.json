        "Andrew is a comic book creator and painter known for his politically incorrect comics , and for his tendency to provoke reactions from people , a trait that led to his being the only student , according to him , to be fired from Colorado State University 's school paper , The Rocky Mountain Collegian , whose staff felt he was intentionally trying to offend certain groups with his cartoons . He has a younger brother named William , who visits in Episode 10 . He chafes against authority , and as a result has been fired from every job that he 's had . Having been dumped by his unfaithful girlfriend , he intends to socialize with women in D.C. MTV describes him as the annoying little brother that you love to hate , but secretly love . Andrew , who states that he likes women who are young , blonde and ditzy ( a preference that Callie and Ashley find distasteful ) , spends the first two thirds of the season unsuccessfully attempting to find sexual partners . He finds success in Episode 11 with a woman named Andrea , who causes him to reevaluate his casual approach to sex . In explaining his distrust of women , he mentions that his mother cheated on his father , and that he regards her as an otherwise good parent . Because of the panda hat he sometimes wears , he earns the nickname Panda . In the reunion show , Mike opines that Andrew was the cast member to undergo the greatest change",

        "Ashley was born in Fort Bragg , California , but moved to Houston to be closer to her now ex-boyfriend . She detests Houston for its climate , culture and the ubiquity of Republicans . Just before finding out that she was cast on The Real World , she modeled in a private test shooting for Playboy and was photographed by Mikki Chernoff . She is of Portuguese descent , and is a caregiver and former delegate from Las Vegas , Nevada for Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election . As a child , she and her mother suffered violence at the hands of her stepfather , and does not have relationships with her family members , including her mother , who cut ties with Ashley a year and a half ago . She now considers her closest friends to be her family , and hopes to add her housemates to that group . She is a voracious reader and passionate debater whom MTV describes as possibly the most politically aware of the cast , with a hot temper and a blunt demeanor that manifests itself in discussions of politics and religion . She is also described as full of contradictions , as she is a tomboy who wears dresses , a liberal Episcopalian Christian who goes to church every Sunday , etc . She is newly single , and hopes to take advantage of this while in D.C. She looks forward to traveling abroad one day , and does not find the prospect of a salaried office job appealing",

Since leaving that group at 13 or 14 , she has tried to make up for lost time , engaging in activities from clubbing to rock climbing to target shooting . She has developed a skepticism of religion that she shares with Ty , and an open-minded , daredevil nature with which searches for new experiences to broaden her horizons , an attitude that carries over to her dating habits . She is also described as an athletic tomboy who used sports to transition to a more secular life , of which her stay in D.C. is an example . She has expressed an openness to the possibility of bisexuality , though she concedes that she tends to push people away because of her commitment issues . She immediately develops a sexual relationship with Ty , though it soon ends , and their time together is marked by frequent conflict , including physical confrontations . She enjoys writing poetry , yoga and football",

        "Mike is a former star high school athlete and prom king , regarded as popular with girls and a golden child from a conservative Christian family . Describing himself as a pile of contradictions , for the past several years he has questioned his sexual orientation and recently came out as bisexual , causing conflict with some of his loved ones . He came to D.C. to be an environmentalist , but unexpectedly became an activist for LGBT rights as well , working for the Human Rights Campaign and the Energy Action Coalition . MTV indicates that his time in D.C. will mark a turning point for him and the question of whether his family will accept his sexuality . Like Ashley , he goes to church every Sunday , providing common ground through which he hopes to bond with her when they first meet in the premiere , though he also sees local men , and pines for Tanner , his ex-boyfriend back home . He has a brother named Jonathan and a sister named Alyssa . His father , Mike Sr. , visits in Episode 14 . Although he is bisexual , he explains in the reunion show that he predominantly saw men during his time in the house because bringing men back home is not something he was previously able to do . He is concerned that being bisexual means his ability to one day get married to the same gender under God may be in doubt",

        "After being abandoned by his parents , Ty lived in a series of foster homes before being adopted at age five . He and his brother grew up in a neighborhood he says is accurately depicted in the TV series The Wire , which includes , for example , a former crack house across the street from his home . He describes his mother 's shame when he was caught stealing as a turning point in his life , when he decided to change his ways and become the focused , well-spoken person he is today . Although he is grateful for what he gained during his religious upbringing in the United Church of Christ , he is now an atheist who thinks most believers in God are narrow-minded . Described as self-reliant by MTV , he is a recent graduate of Trinity College , where he majored in economics and played football . He is also described as opinionated , and a smooth , funny charmer , but whose temper sometimes gets the best of him . His girlfriend of three years , Lauren , broke up with him prior to filming because she could not accept his co-ed living arrangements in the Real World house , a status cemented when he informs her he has begun a sexual relationship with Emily . That relationship , however , is brief , and devolves into recurring conflict , which partially leads to a house meeting over his behavior when intoxicated . He has described encountering opposition from family members of non-African-American women he has dated in the past",
