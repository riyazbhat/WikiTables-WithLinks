  "section_text": "Main article : List of Medal of Honor recipients The first Medals of Honor ( Army version ) were awarded and presented to six Union soldiers ( `` Andrews Raiders '' ) on March 25 , 1863 , by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , in his office of the War Department . Private Jacob Parrott , a U.S. Army volunteer from Ohio , became the first actual Medal of Honor recipient , awarded for his volunteering for and participation in a raid on a Confederate train in Big Shanty , Georgia on April 12 , 1862 , during the American Civil War . After the medal presentations , the six decorated soldiers met with President Lincoln in the White House . [ 26 ] [ 137 ] The first Navy Medal of Honor was awarded by the Navy on April 3 , 1863 to 41 sailors ( 17 awards for action during the Battle of Forts Jackson and St . Philip ) . [ 138 ] The first Marines awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy version ) were John F. Mackie and Pinkerton R. Vaughn on July 10 , 1863 ; [ 139 ] Mackie for USS Galena on May 15 , 1862 and Vaughn for USS Mississippi on March 14 , 1863 . They both are the first Marine recipients ; Vaughn 's date of receipt/presentation has not been determined . The first and only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy version ) was Signalman First Class Douglas Munro ( posthumously ) on May 27 , 1943 , for evacuating 500 Marines under fire on September 27 , 1942 , during the Battle of Guadalcanal . [ 140 ] Munro was a Canadian American ( Canadian-born , naturalized U.S . citizen ) . [ 141 ] The only woman awarded the Medal of Honor ( Army version ) is Mary Edwards Walker , who was a civilian Army surgeon during the American Civil War . She received the award in 1865 after the Judge Advocate General of the Army determined that she could not be given a retroactive commission , and so President Andrew Johnson directed that `` the usual medal of honor for meritorious services be given her . `` [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The first black Medal of Honor recipients were sixteen Army and sixteen Navy service members that fought during the Civil War . The first award was announced on April 6 , 1865 , to twelve black soldiers from the five regiments of U.S . Colored Troops who fought at New Market Heights outside of Richmond on September 29 , 1864 . [ 52 ] 61 Canadians who served in the United States Armed Forces , mostly during the American Civil War . Since 1900 , four Canadians have received the medal . [ 147 ] The only Canadian-born , naturalized U.S. citizen to receive the medal for heroism during the Vietnam War was Peter C . Lemon . [ 148 ] While the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor ( 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 6241 ) , beginning in 1918 , explicitly stated that a recipient must be `` an officer or enlisted man of the Army '' , `` distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty '' , and perform an act of valor `` in action involving actual conflict with an enemy '' , [ 86 ] exceptions have been made :",
