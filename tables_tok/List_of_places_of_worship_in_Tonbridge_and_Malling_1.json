  "intro": "The borough of Tonbridge and Malling, one of 13 local government districts in the English county of Kent, has more than 80 current and former places of worship. Many are in the ancient town of Tonbridge, the largest centre of population in the mostly rural area, but many of the surrounding villages and hamlets have their own places of worship - including ancient Anglican parish churches, Nonconformist chapels and modern buildings serving a wide variety of Christian denominations. As of 2020, 63 places of worship are in use in the borough, and a further 21 former churches and chapels no longer hold religious services but survive in alternative uses. The majority of Tonbridge and Malling's residents identify themselves as Christian. The borough has nearly 40 Anglican churches serving the Church of England, the country's Established Church. Buildings of many styles and sizes are used for Anglican worship: from the tiny tin tabernacles at Hadlow Stair and Golden Green to the expansive stone-built edifices at East Malling and Aylesford, and from Saxon- and Norman-era churches (as at Snodland and Wouldham) to 20th-century buildings in wayside hamlets and on suburban housing estates. Non-Anglican worshippers are accommodated in a variety of mostly 19th- and 20th-century chapels and meeting rooms: Baptists, Methodists and Roman Catholics each have several churches, and smaller religious groups such as Open Brethren and Jehovah's Witnesses can also be found in the borough. English Heritage has awarded listed status to 37 places of worship in Tonbridge and Malling borough. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest."
