  "section_text": "A wind turbine blade on I-35 near Elm Mott , an increasingly common sight in Texas Main article : Wind power in Texas In 2016 Texas surpassed the 20,000 MW mark by adding over 1800 MW of generating capacity . [ 6 ] In 2011 , Texas had become the first state to surpass the 10,000 MW mark . [ 52 ] In July 2008 , Texas approved a $ 4.93 billion expansion of the state 's electric grid to bring wind energy to its major cities from western areas of the state . Transmission companies will recoup the cost of constructing the new power lines , expected to be completed in 2013 , from fees estimated at $ 4 per month for residential customers . [ 53 ] A lack of transmission capacity forced wind turbines to be shut down at times and reduced wind power generation in Texas by 17% in 2009 . [ 54 ] The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe , Texas , Texas 's largest wind farm with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW , surpassed the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center . [ 55 ] It is located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) west of Fort Worth and the wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties . [ 56 ] [ 57 ]",

  "intro": "Wind power in the United States is a branch of the energy industry that has expanded quickly over the latest several years. For the twelve months through September 2019, 286.6 terawatt-hours were generated by wind power, or 6.94% of all generated electrical energy. As of September 2019, the total installed wind power nameplate generating capacity in the United States was 100,125 megawatts (MW). This capacity is exceeded only by China and the European Union. Thus far, wind power's largest growth in capacity was in 2012, when 11,895 MW of wind power was installed, representing 26.5% of new power capacity. By September of 2019, 19 states had over 1,000 MW of installed capacity with 5 states (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and California) generating over half of all wind energy in the nation. Texas, with over 27,000 MW of capacity, about 16.8% of the state's electricity usage, had the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state at the end of 2019. Texas also had more under construction than any other state currently has installed. The state generating the highest percentage of energy from wind power is Iowa at 40.1% of total energy production, while North Dakota has the most per capita wind generation. The Alta Wind Energy Center in California is the largest wind farm in the United States with a capacity of 1,548 MW. GE Power is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer."
