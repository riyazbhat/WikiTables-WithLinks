  "section_text": "A wind turbine blade on I-35 near Elm Mott , an increasingly common sight in Texas Main article : Wind power in Texas In 2016 Texas surpassed the 20,000 MW mark by adding over 1800 MW of generating capacity . [ 6 ] In 2011 , Texas had become the first state to surpass the 10,000 MW mark . [ 52 ] In July 2008 , Texas approved a $ 4.93 billion expansion of the state 's electric grid to bring wind energy to its major cities from western areas of the state . Transmission companies will recoup the cost of constructing the new power lines , expected to be completed in 2013 , from fees estimated at $ 4 per month for residential customers . [ 53 ] A lack of transmission capacity forced wind turbines to be shut down at times and reduced wind power generation in Texas by 17 % in 2009 . [ 54 ] The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe , Texas , Texas 's largest wind farm with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW , surpassed the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center . [ 55 ] It is located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) west of Fort Worth and the wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties . [ 56 ] [ 57 ]",
