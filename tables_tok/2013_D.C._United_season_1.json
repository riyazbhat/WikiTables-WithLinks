  "intro": "The 2013 D.C. United season was the club's eighteenth, and their eighteenth season in Major League Soccer, the top division of American soccer. The regular season began on March 2 and concluded on October 27. Outside of MLS play, the club competed in the U.S. Open Cup. Also, for the first time in their history, they played in the Walt Disney World Pro Soccer Classic, a preseason tournament to be held in February, after participating in the Carolina Challenge Cup for the past five seasons. After a promising 2012 campaign, United's form took a sharp turn downward as injuries, underachievement from offseason acquisitions, and a loss of form caused the team to record the worst season in MLS history. The extremely poor season came as universal shock to fans and media, who thought United would be one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference, and a potential candidate for the MLS Cup title. Despite their poor league play, United qualified for the 2014-15 CONCACAF Champions League by winning the 2013 U.S. Open Cup Final on October 1. That marked their 13th major honor, the most in North American soccer history."
