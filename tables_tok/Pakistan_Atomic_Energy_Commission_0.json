  "intro": "The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC; Urdu: \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06c1 \u062c\u0648\u06c1\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646) is an independent governmental authority and a scientific research institution, concerned with research and development of nuclear power, promotion of nuclear science, energy conservation and the peaceful usage of nuclear technology. Since its establishment in 1956, the PAEC has overseen the extensive development of nuclear infrastructure to support the economical uplift of Pakistan by founding institutions that focus on development on food irradiation and on nuclear medicine radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The PAEC organizes conferences and directs research at the country's leading universities. Since the 1960s, the PAEC is also a scientific research partner and sponsor of European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), where Pakistani scientists have contributed to developing particle accelerators and research on high-energy physics. PAEC scientists regularly pay visits to CERN while taking part in projects led by CERN. In 2001, the PAEC was integrated with the National Command Authority (Pakistan) which is under the Prime Minister of Pakistan."
