  "section_title": "Main setlist",
  "section_text": "The primary single player mode is the Career Mode , in which the player works through 31 songs divided into six sequential tiers as listed below , each representing a different chapter and at a different location during Aerosmith 's career and reflecting an increasing difficulty in the songs . In Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , the first two songs of each tier , representing opening acts , [ 4 ] must be successfully completed before two Aerosmith or Joe Perry songs are presented . Once these are complete , the player then must complete ( or turn down ) the Encore song before they can move onto the next tier . The tiers are arranged as to follow Aerosmith 's rise to success , starting at their first performance at Mendon-Upton Nipmuc Regional High School , up through their performance at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show and their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . [ 5 ] The last tier features an additional Boss Battle against Joe Perry . In addition to the 31 main songs , ten additional songs can be unlocked from `` The Vault '' using in-game money earned during Career Mode . Once songs have been unlocked in Career Mode or from `` The Vault '' , the player may then play these songs at any time in Quickplay mode , play co-operatively with another player performing the bass or rhythm guitar line , or compete in head-to-head battles offline or online . [ 3 ] There is no Co-op Career Mode as was present in Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock While tracks from Deep Purple and The White Stripes were initially reported to be in the game , they are not in the final setlist . [ 6 ] There are no plans to offer the tracks from the game as downloadable content for Guitar Hero III or Guitar Hero World Tour . [ 7 ] However , `` Rag Doll '' , `` Love in an Elevator '' and `` Livin ' on the Edge '' will be released as full band DLC for Guitar Hero 5 on the 18th of May . [ 8 ] All Aerosmith and Joe Perry songs in the game are master recordings as marked in the table below ; in the case of four Aerosmith songs , these were specifically re-recorded for the game due to the lack of existing master recordings . [ 1 ] All but four of the `` opening acts '' are also master recordings ; in the case of the other four songs , these are cover versions performed either by WaveGroup Sound or Steve Ouimette . The year column in the table reflects the year the song was recorded as stated in the game",
