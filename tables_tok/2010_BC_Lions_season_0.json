  "intro": "The 2010 BC Lions season was the 53rd season for the team in the Canadian Football League and their 57th overall. The Lions finished the season in third place in the West Division with a second consecutive 8-10 record and qualified for the playoffs by winning their last game of the season. If they had lost, the Edmonton Eskimos would have qualified instead. The team had a dismal start, posting a 1-7 record to start the season, but won seven of their last 10 games to qualify for the playoffs for the 14th consecutive season. The Lions played the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the West Semi-Final, but lost the game in double overtime 41-38. Due to renovations to BC Place, the Lions played at a temporary stadium located on the site of their old home field, Empire Stadium. Additionally, Head Coach and General Manager Wally Buono announced that training camp would be held in Kamloops for the next three seasons, beginning with 2010."
