  "intro": "Colombia competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's eighteenth appearance at the Olympics, having not competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Comit\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpico Colombiano sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, surpassing the record by having more than a quarter more athletes than represented Colombia in Beijing. A total of 104 athletes, 48 men and 56 women, competed in 18 sports. Women's football was the only team-based sport in which Colombia was represented in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in fencing, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo and triathlon. This was Colombia's most successful Olympics (until Rio 2016), winning a total of eight medals (one gold, three silver, and four bronze). BMX rider and world champion Mariana Paj\u00f3n, who was Colombia's flag bearer at the opening ceremony, won the nation's first gold medal since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Freestyle wrestler Jackeline Renter\u00eda became the first Colombian female athlete to claim two Olympic medals, while triple jumper Caterine Ibarg\u00fcen won the nation's second medal in the track and field after 20 years. Other notable accomplishments included the nation's first ever Olympic medals in road cycling, judo and taekwondo."
