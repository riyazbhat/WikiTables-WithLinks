  "intro": "The 2013 S.League was the 18th season since the establishment of the S.League, the top professional football league in Singapore. It is known as the Yeo's Great Eastern S.League for sponsorship reasons. The season began in February 2013 and ended in November 2013. Tampines Rovers defended their title and the 2013 edition featured 12 teams in the league after Gombak United decided to sit out of the league due to financial problems. Tampines Rovers beat Warriors F.C. on 15 February 2013 with a 2-1 scoreline to lift the 2013 Charity Shield, kicking off the 2013 S.League season. The league also saw a month-long break between 26 May 2013 and 26 June 2013 in order for the preliminary round of the RHB Singapore Cup and Starhub League Cup to take place."
