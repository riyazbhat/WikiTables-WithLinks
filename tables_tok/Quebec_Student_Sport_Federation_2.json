  "intro": "The R\u00e9seau du sport \u00e9tudiant du Qu\u00e9bec (RSEQ; literal translation: Quebec Student Sports Network) is the current name for the organisation formerly known as the Quebec Student Sports Federation (QSSF) in English. RSEQ is the governing body of primary and secondary school, collegiate and university sport in Quebec. It also serves as a regional membership association for Canadian universities which assists in co-ordinating competition between their university level athletic programs and providing contact information, schedules, results, and releases about those programs and events to the public and the media. This is similar to what would be called a college athletic conference in the United States. The RSEQ, which covers Quebec, is one of four such bodies that are members of the country's governing body for university athletics, U Sports. The other three regional associations coordinating university-level sports in Canada are Ontario University Athletics (OUA), Atlantic University Sport (AUS), and the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CW). The RSEQ was initially known as the Quebec Universities Athletic Association (QUAA) when it was founded in 1971 with the reformulations of three university athletic associations spanning the universities of Ontario and Quebec. After the merger between the university, collegiate and high school governing bodies in 1989, the amalgamated association was named to the QSSF and then renamed RSEQ in November 2010. As with all of Canada's provincial high school athletics associations, the RSEQ is an affiliate member of the United States-based National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS)."
