  "intro": "This is a list of properties and historic districts in Tennessee that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There are over 2,000 in total. Of these, 29 are National Historic Landmarks. Each of Tennessee's 95 counties has at least one listing. The Tennessee Historical Commission, which manages the state's participation in the National Register program, reports that 80 percent of the state's area has been surveyed for historic buildings. Surveys for archaeological sites have been less extensive; coverage is estimated less than 5 percent of the state. Not all properties that have been determined to be eligible for National Register are listed. The locations of National Register properties and districts (at least for all showing latitude and longitude coordinates below), may be seen in an online map by clicking on Map of all coordinates."
