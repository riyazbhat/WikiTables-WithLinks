This old-western themed short features Foxy developing affection for the tavern singer who would become his girlfriend . Foxy and his then-nameless girlfriend would appear in another cartoon that same year : Smile , Darn Ya , Smile ! ( September 5 , 1931 ) , a musical set on a trolley . The plot bares some similarities to Trolley Troubles , a 1928 Oswald Rabbit cartoon which Harman and Ising contributed on . This also marks the first time Foxy 's name was mentioned",
