  "intro": "The following list of fictional mustelids is subsidiary to the list of fictional animals. This list is limited solely to notable non-badger and non-raccoon characters that appear in works of fiction and that are in the musteloidea superfamily of mammals. This includes weasels, ferrets, minks, otters, martens, and skunks. Fictional badgers are instead found within the list of fictional badgers. Fictional raccoons are found in the list of fictional raccoons. If a character appears in more than one medium, it is sorted under the primary one. Thus, despite occasional appearances in licensed video games, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew is listed under the list of fictional mustelids in animation."
