  "section_text": "This compilation saw its release on January 25 , 2007 .",
  "uid": "Taito_Memories_1",
  "intro": "Taito Memories[a] is a series of arcade video game compilations developed and published by Taito exclusively in Japan. A total of five collections were released - four on the PlayStation 2, and one on the PlayStation Portable. The first entry, Taito Memories J\u014dkan, was released in 2005, with the latest being Taito Memories II Gekan, released in 2007. The PlayStation 2 entries each have twenty-five titles, while the PlayStation Portable game has sixteen - all included games are arcade games published by Taito. A similar series of collections, Taito Legends, was released outside Japan in North America and Europe - many titles from the Taito Memories series would be added into several Taito Legends compilations, alongside much of its user-interface being re-used. The series was a commercial success for Taito, with a few entries being re-released under The Best budget line-up - the first two compilations sold 145,616 copies combined. [n 1] Critical reception for the games were also positive, with their large selection of games being highly praised, although criticism would be drawn to later entries, many classifying their game library as filler content. Square Enix holds the rights to the series, following their acquisition of Taito."
