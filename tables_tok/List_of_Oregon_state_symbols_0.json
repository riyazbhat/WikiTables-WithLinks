  "intro": "The U.S. state of Oregon has 27 official emblems, as designated by the Oregon State Legislature. Most of the symbols are listed in Title 19, Chapter 186 of the Oregon Revised Statutes (2011 edition). Oregon's first symbol was the motto Alis Volat Propriis, written and translated in 1854. Latin for She Flies With Her Own Wings, the motto remained unchanged until 1957, when The Union became the official state motto. Alis Volat Propriis became the state motto once again in 1987. Originally designed in 1857, usage of the Oregon State Seal began after Oregon became the 33rd state of the United States on February 14, 1859. The motto and seal served as Oregon's only symbols until over 50 years later, when the Oregon-grape became the state flower in 1899. Oregon had six official symbols by 1950 and 22 symbols by 2000. The newest symbol of Oregon is brewer's yeast, declared the state microbe in 2013. While some of the symbols are unique to Oregon, others are used by multiple states. For example, the western meadowlark, Oregon's state bird, is also an official symbol for Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming. The North American beaver is also the state animal of New York, and the Chinook salmon (sometimes known as the king salmon) is also the state fish of Alaska."
