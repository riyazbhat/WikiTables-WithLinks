  "intro": "The IG postcode area, also known as the Ilford postcode area, is a group of 11 postcode districts in England, which are subdivisions of six post towns. These cover parts of east London and southwest Essex. The area served includes much of the London Borough of Redbridge, the western part of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham (namely Barking) and the southwestern part of the Epping Forest district of Essex, while the western part of IG8 covers a small part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The 'IG' is used instead of 'IL', as the latter could be confused with 'L11-L19' or 'LL1-9'. G was chosen in preference to J (or F as within the word Ilford) to reflect Chigwell and Barking in its area. Mail is assigned to local Delivery Offices at Romford along with the E and RM postcode area mail."
