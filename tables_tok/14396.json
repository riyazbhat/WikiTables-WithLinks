          "In its prime , The Florida Brewing Company produced 80,000 barrels of beer annually , making it the leading exporter of beer to Cuba in the U.S. and the premier brewery on Florida 's West coast . The Florida Brewing Company survived the Prohibition and continued to thrive through the Great Depression . However , the embargo on Cuba and the opening of the Anheuser-Busch Company in Tampa ultimately led to its closing in 1961 . A cigar company later took over the building . It also served as a bomb shelter during the Cold War . The building was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair until it was restored in 1999 . It now serves as offices for the law firm of Swope , Rodante P.A"
