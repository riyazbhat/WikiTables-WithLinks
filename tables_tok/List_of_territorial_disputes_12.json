        "Disputed between the United States and Canada ( then a British Dominion with its foreign affairs controlled from London ) . The dispute had been going on between the Russian and British Empires since 1821 , and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867 . It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 with a delegation that included 3 Americans , 2 Canadians , and 1 British delegate that became the swing vote . By a 4 to 2 vote , the final resolution favored the American position . Canada did not get an outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea . The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States , and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in pursuit of a friendly relationship between Britain and the United States",

During 1749-64 , Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred grants , offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont . In 1764 , King George III attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York . But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth 's grants , so local governments and militias resisted New York 's rule . In 1777 , the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York , Britain , and New Hampshire , calling it the State of Vermont . Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country , considered by New York to be a district in rebellion . Negotiations between New York and Vermont in 1790 removed impediments to Vermont 's admission to the Union in 1791",
