  "intro": "The Real World: Hollywood is the twentieth season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the fifth season of The Real World to be filmed in the Pacific States region of the United States, specifically in California, after The Real World: San Diego. The season features a total of nine cast members over the course of the season, as one cast member is evicted and replaced, and another is replaced after he voluntarily leaves the show. It is the only season to be set in the district of Hollywood and the second season to take place in a city that has hosted a previous season, as the show's second season was set in Los Angeles in 1993. This season also makes California the most commonly used state to be used as a setting for the series. Production started from August to December 2007. The season premiered on April 16, 2008 and consisted of 13 episodes. Comedian Andy Dick appears in Episode 3, when the cast begins their work at the Hollywood comedy club iO WEST."
