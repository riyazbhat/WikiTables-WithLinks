Gates remained in second , while Amancio Ortega moved up to third . Ortega 's gain of $ 19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list . [ 30 ] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000 , placing fourth . Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers , debuting with an estimate net worth of $ 3 billion . [ 31 ] A global rise in asset prices led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare `` It [ was ] a very good year to be a billionaire '' . However , it was not a good year to be Eike Batista , who fell from seventh to 100th , suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list . [ 30 ] Overall , net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1 . [ 31 ] A record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list , representing $ 5.4 trillion of assets . [ 32 ] Of those , 442 billionaires hailed from the United States . [ 30 ] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366 . The list also featured a record number of newcomers , 210 , representing 42 countries . 60 people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollars of assets in 2013 , and eight others from the 2012 list died . The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs , with 29 , followed by the United States with 16 . The 2013 list featured 138 women , of which 50 came from the United States . A majority of the list ( 961 individuals , 67 percent ) were entirely self-made ; 184 ( 13 percent ) inherited their wealth , and 281 ( 20 percent ) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen .
