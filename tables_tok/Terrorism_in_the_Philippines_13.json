About 70 gunmen linked to the extremist Abu Sayyaf group fired grenade launchers and automatic rifles on houses , and torched others while residents were sleeping , killing one government-armed militiaman and 10 civilians in the village of Tubigan on the island of Basilan . The regional health chief confirmed that seventeen people were wounded in the attack , with nine in a critical condition , including four children . Several of those critically wounded died later in Zamboanga City hospitals . The attack followed the killing of an Abu Sayyaf commander and the arrest of two key members and government forces had been warned to be on alert for reprisal attacks . Lieutenant General Ben Dolorfino , chief of the military 's Western Mindanao Command , indicated that a clan war was the apparent motive in the killings and the attack had been motivated by a personal grudge with the village chairman",

The first bomb detonated inside a van about 10:30 am outside an education department building and opposite a sports stadium . The second , rigged to a motorcycle left near a Roman Catholic church , exploded minutes later and heavily damaged the building . The bombings ignited gun battles around the city between rebels and security forces , with the militants allegedly targeting helpless civilians seeking cover . A civilian was briefly held hostage while some militants fled and third bomb placed near a judge 's house opposite a bus terminal was safely detonated later by soldiers . The city mayor , Cherry Akbar , stated almost all of the 14 fatalities were caused by small arms fire , including at least four militants , one of whom apparently perished in the first blast . Two injured suspects were arrested after the attack and interrogated , giving an account that they had been hired",

As suicide bombings have not been known to happen before in the Philippines , police were investigating the theory that the suspected bomber was not a suicide bomber in the usual sense , but a proxy who may not have known he was carrying a remotely detonated weapon . The Governor of Sulu , Sakur Tan , stated that the bomb may have been intended for him as he arrived from Manila , however Army officers believe the attack had been linked to the U.S. ambassador 's visit to Zamboanga , scheduled for 6 August and cancelled for security reasons",
