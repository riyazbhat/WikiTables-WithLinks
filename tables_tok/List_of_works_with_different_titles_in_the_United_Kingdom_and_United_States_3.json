Unless otherwise noted, UK titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that Canada generally uses US titles. Australia will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to American and British English spelling differences; for example, the American film Rumor Has It. is titled Rumour Has It. in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.
