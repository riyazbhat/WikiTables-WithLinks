  "intro": "The State Award System of the Russian Federation has varied and distinct origins. The first being pre-1917 orders of the Russian Empire re-established after the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the second is from former Soviet orders that were slightly modified and retained post 1991, we also find many completely new awards resembling Imperial awards in basic design since the reintroduction of Russian heraldry. Originally set up following the dissolution of the Soviet Union by Decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation \u2116 2557-I of March 20, 1992, the statutes of all state awards was later ratified in Presidential Decree \u2116 442 of March 2, 1994. The entire state awards' system of the Russian Federation was amended on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree \u2116 1099, this all encompassing decree distanced modern Russian awards from their Soviet roots. Presidential Decree \u2116 1631 of December 16, 2011 amended and finalized the order of precedence of all modern Russian awards. Awards can be revoked by the State Duma if the recipient is not deemed fit to receive the award."
