  "intro": "The Israel Super Cup, also known as Champion of Champions (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e3 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd , Aluf HaAlufim), is an Israeli association football club competition played as a single match between the winner of the latest Israeli top league champions and the winner of the latest Israel State Cup. If a team won both the championship and the state cup, their designated rival for the Super Cup match was the league runner-up. The cup was first contested in 1957, but the title was an informal title, not sanctioned by the IFA Until 1969. As an IFA sanctioned competition, the competition was played annually, except for 1972, 1973 and 1987 until its cancellation in 1990. Between 1969 and 1971 The IFA also sanctioned a Champion of Champions match for Liga Alef, which was played between the two regional winners of Liga Alef. The match was played once more, at the end of the 1975-76 season, and was discontinued after the establishment of Liga Artzit. The most successful clubs were Hapoel Tel Aviv, Maccabi Netanya and Maccabi Tel Aviv with 5 titles each. In March 2014 the IFA announced the renewal of the competition."
