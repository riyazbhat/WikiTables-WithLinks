The modern visitor enters by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel . The exit , a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff , was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers , which made the small village was easy to defend . One log was dated at 1278 so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area . Visitors can enter Balcony House through ranger guided tours . This photo is of an Emmett Harryson , a Navajo , at a T-shaped doorway at Balcony House ( 1929 )",
