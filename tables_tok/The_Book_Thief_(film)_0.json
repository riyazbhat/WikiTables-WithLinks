  "intro": "The Book Thief is a 2013 World War II war drama film directed by Brian Percival and starring Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and Sophie N\u00e9lisse. The film is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak and adapted by Michael Petroni. The film is about a young girl living with her adoptive German family during the Nazi era. Taught to read by her kind-hearted foster father, the girl begins borrowing books and sharing them with the Jewish refugee being sheltered by her foster parents in their home. The film features a musical score by Oscar-winning composer John Williams. The Book Thief premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 3, 2013, and was released for general distribution in the United States on November 8, 2013. The film received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release with some reviewers praising its fresher perspective on the war and its focus on the consistent thread of humanity in the story, with other critics faulting the film's wishful narrative. With a budget of $19 million, the film was successful at the box office, earning over $76 million. The Book Thief received Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for its score. For her performance in the film, Sophie N\u00e9lisse won the Hollywood Film Festival Spotlight Award, the Satellite Newcomer Award, and the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role - Female. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 11, 2014."
