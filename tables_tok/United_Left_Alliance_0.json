  "intro": "The United Left Alliance (Irish: Comhaontas Aontaithe an Chl\u00e9) was an electoral alliance of left-wing political parties and independent politicians in the Republic of Ireland, formed to contest the 2011 general election. The grouping originally consisted of three existing political parties, the Socialist Party, the People Before Profit Alliance (PBPA), and the Workers and Unemployed Action Group (WUAG), as well as former members of the Labour Party. Its formation was announced in early November 2010 and it was formally launched on 29 November 2010 at the Gresham Hotel in Dublin. In the February 2011 general election it ran twenty candidates of which five were elected. Its share of the national vote was 2.6%. The Workers and Unemployed Action Group withdrew from the alliance on 2 October 2012 following disagreements with the other parties. The Socialist Party left the United Left Alliance in January 2013, later co-founding the Anti-Austerity Alliance. There was a reorientation within the ULA in March 2013 when Joan Collins TD left PBPA and, along with other public representatives Clare Daly TD and Cllr Declan Bree as well as some individual members, formed a new platform or organisation within the ULA called United Left. Since late 2013, the Alliance is essentially defunct."
