  "intro": "This list of 18th-century journals covers published academic journals from a variety of fields, that were current and printed between 1700 and 1799. It also includes journals that, although initially published before 1700, were current and in print during that century as well. Note that a number of personal books and publications were also titled as journals; unless notable, these have been excluded."
