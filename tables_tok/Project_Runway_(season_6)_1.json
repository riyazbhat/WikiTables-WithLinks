  "intro": "The sixth season of Project Runway, a reality competition show about fashion design, premiered on Lifetime on August 20, 2009, the first season to be aired on that network. The production of this season started in September 2008 and finished the pre-finale filming on October 17, 2008. It is the only season of Project Runway filmed at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. Returning as judges are supermodel Heidi Klum, fashion designer Michael Kors, and Marie Claire fashion director Nina Garcia. Tim Gunn returned as a mentor to the aspiring designers. This is the second season which consisted of all female finalists. The winner of this season of Project Runway, Irina Shabayeva, received an editorial feature in an issue of Marie Claire magazine, a cash prize of $100,000 to start her own line, and an all-expenses-paid trip for two to Paris. Furthermore, the winning model of this season, Kalyn Hemphill, received a $25,000 cash prize from LOreal and took part in the winning designer's fashion spread in Marie Claire. The premiere was preceded by a two-hour special episode of Project Runway: All-Star Challenge where eight past contestants (Daniel Vosovic, Santino Rice, Jeffrey Sebelia, Uli Herzner, Mychael Knight, Chris March, Sweet P, and Korto Momolu) competed in one challenge with a cash prize of $100,000. Vosovic won the challenge, while Momolu came in second place, Sweet P in third, and March in fourth. In 2012, Gordana Gehlhausen competed on Project Runway: All Stars where she finished 11th of 13. Also in 2012, Althea Harper competed on Project Runway All Stars (season 2) placing 8th of 13."
