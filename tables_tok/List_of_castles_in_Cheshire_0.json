        "Beeston Castle is on a crag 90 m ( 300 ft ) above the surrounding countryside , at the northern end of the Peckforton Hills . The site is strategically strong because of its natural defences and overlooks the surrounding area for miles . It has an outer and inner bailey and no motte ; this , coupled with strong defensive walls and gatehouse and no inner keep means it is an enclosure type castle . The inner bailey is surrounded by a sheer drop on three sides , and is protected by a 9 m ( 30 ft ) deep ditch on the fourth side . The curtain wall of the outer bailey was 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) thick . It was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , and is similar in design to Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire which he built around the same time . The castle passed into the possession of the Crown when John le Scot , Blondeville 's heir , died in 1237 . Beeston Castle was involved in the Second Barons ' War ( 1264-1265 ) when it was captured by Prince Edward from Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester . In the English Civil War it was captured by the Parliamentarians and then recaptured by the Royalists before being slighted in 1646 to render its defences useless . The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and is now a museum",

        "Chester Castle was built in 1070 by William the Conqueror . Originally a motte-and-bailey castle constructed from timber and turf , it was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century . The castle underwent many periods of construction , with an outer bailey , new towers along the inner bailey , new structures within the castle walls , and a new gatehouse all added in the 13th century , during the Welsh Wars . Chester Castle was given by William I to the Earls of Chester and it served as the administrative centre of the earldom . It passed into the possession of the Crown on the extinction of the line of earls in 1237 . After the 13th century , most expenditure on the castle was to maintain it rather than aggrandise it as happened with other castles such as Warwick Castle . When the medieval castle was destroyed by fire in the 18th century , only the Agricola Tower survived . The tower ( also known as Caesar 's Tower ) and the curtain walls are Grade I listed buildings",

A kidney-shaped bailey next to the motte measures 80 m ( 260 ft ) north-south and 38 m ( 125 ft ) east-west .

Shotwick Castle was probably built by Hugh Lupus , 1st Earl of Chester , in the late 11th century , although the castle was first documented in 1260 . It was used as border defence against the Welsh until peace was achieved in 1281 . After this , it fell out of use as a military castle , and became part of a royal manor and game park for Edward III . Shotwick Castle was ruinous by 1621 and demolished in 1756 . The castle survives as earthworks but has been damaged by treasure hunters and ploughing , and is now used as pasture",

  "intro": "There are 20 castles in the county of Cheshire in North West England. Cheshire is one of the historic counties of England and its historic boundaries are different from the modern county lines. Some castles that were formerly in Cheshire are now in Greater Manchester. In addition, Warrington Castle is historically a part of Lancashire but is within the current boundaries of Cheshire. Before the Norman conquest of England began in 1066, defensive sites in England were communal, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs built as a defence against the Danes. Castles were popularised in England by the Normans - although a few sites in the south-east pre-dating the Norman conquest - and were owned by the feudal lords. The primary purpose of a castle was military: to be used as a base of operations and to control the surrounding areas. A castle was considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area, and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. Castles can take several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which consists of a motte (a mound) - surmounted by a keep or tower - connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses."
