  "intro": "The name Azerbaijan itself is derived from Atropates, the Persian Satrap (governor) of Medea in the Achaemenid empire, who ruled a region found in modern Iranian Azerbaijan called Atropatene. Atropates name is believed to be derived from the Old Persian roots meaning protected by fire. The name is also mentioned in the Avestan Frawardin Yasht: \u00e2terep\u00e2tahe ashaon\u00f4 fravash\u00eem \u00fdazamaide which translates literally to: We worship the Fravashi of the holy Atare-pata. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam: In Middle Persian the name of the province was called \u0100turp\u0101t\u0101k\u0101n, older new-Persian \u0100dharb\u0101dhag\u0101n (\u0622\u0630\u0631\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646/\u0622\u0630\u0631\u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646), \u0100dharb\u0101yag\u0101n, at present \u0100zerb\u0101ydj\u0101n/\u0100zarb\u0101ydj\u0101n, Greek Atropat\u00edni (\u1fbf\u0391\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7), Byzantine Greek Adravig\u00e1non (\u1fbf\u0391\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd), Armenian Atrpatakan, Syriac Adhorb\u0101ygh\u0101n. The name Atropat in Middle Persian was transformed to Adharbad and is connected with Zoroastrianism. A famous Zoroastrian priest by the name Adarbad Mahraspandan is well known for his counsels. Azerbaijan, due to its numerous fire-temples has also been quoted in a variety of historic sources as being the birthplace of the prophet Zoroaster although modern scholars have not yet reached an agreement on the location of his birth. With Qajar Iran being forced to cede to Imperial Russia its Caucasian territories north of the Aras River (that is, modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and the Republic of Azerbaijan) during the course of the 19th century, through the treaties of Gulistan (1813) and Turkmenchay (1828), vast amounts of soil were irrevocably lost. Following the disintegration of the Russian Empire in 1917, as well as the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, in 1918, the leading Musavat government adopted the name Azerbaijan for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was proclaimed on May 27, 1918, for political reasons, even though the name of Azerbaijan had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. Thus, until 1918, when the Musavat regime decided to name the newly independent state Azerbaijan, this designation had been used exclusively to identify the Iranian province of Azerbaijan."
