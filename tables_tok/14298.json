          "The Germans introduced another small flamethrower design in 1916 to replace the earlier Kleif . The Wechselapparat ( Wex ) had a doughnut-shaped backpack fuel container with a spherical propellant container in the middle . This design was updated during the Second World War to become flamethrower model 40 . However , model 40 was considered too fragile so it was soon replaced by model 41 , a simpler construction with smaller , horizontal , cylindrical backpack containers . The doughnut-shaped container design was copied by the British during World War II"
