  "section_text": "From its creation in 1952 until 1971 the VW designation designated `` Air Early Warning Squadron '' , `` Airborne Early Warning Squadron '' , or `` Fleet Early Warning Squadron '' . By 1961 the VW squadrons which were still in existence were transitioned to destructive weather early warning or weather reconnaissance as a primary mission while retaining airborne early warning as a secondary role . In 1955 and 1956 six new VW squadrons were established to operate as early warning squadrons in the Atlantic and Pacific Barriers which were seaward extensions of the nation 's Distant Early Warning ( DEW ) Line . These `` barrier '' VW squadrons did not operate as weather reconnaissance squadrons and they were all disestablished by 1965 . In 1967 one of the two remaining VW squadrons was renamed a `` Weather Reconnaissance Squadron '' ( while retaining the VW designation ) while the other retained the `` Airborne Early Warning '' name even though its primary role was also weather reconnaissance . In 1971 that squadron was disestablished and thereafter until the single remaining VW squadron was disestablished in 1975 the VW designation designated solely `` Weather Reconnaissance Squadron '' . In 1975 the VW designation cease being used . [ 51 ]",

  "intro": "There are hundreds of US Navy aircraft squadrons which are not currently active dating back to before World War II (the U.S. Navy operated aircraft prior to World War I, but it did not organize them in squadrons until after that war). To be more accurate: there are hundreds of former U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been disestablished and no longer exist and there are approximately 40 or so U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been deactivated and which currently exist only on paper in an inactive status. These disestablished and/or deactivated squadrons are sometimes incorrectly referred to as decommissioned squadrons, but proper usage prior to 1998, was that squadrons were established and disestablished and after 1998, squadrons are established, deactivated and sometimes reactivated. It has never been correct to refer to U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons as being commissioned and decommissioned, ships are commissioned and decommissioned, U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons are not."
