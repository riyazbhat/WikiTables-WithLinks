  "section_text": "A press conference with Paul , 6 July 2010 Paul 's accurate choices for the 2010 World Cup , broadcast live by German news channel n-tv , endowed him with celebrity status . [ 3 ] Paul predicted the winners of each of the seven 2010 FIFA World Cup matches that the German team played , against Australia , Serbia , Ghana , England , Argentina , Spain , [ 21 ] and Uruguay . His prediction that Argentina would lose prompted Argentine chef Nicolas Bedorrou to post an octopus recipe on Facebook .

He will survive . \u2014 Oliver Walenciak ( Paul 's keeper ) [ 22 ] Paul correctly predicted the outcome of the semi-final , by choosing the food in the box marked with the Spanish flag . German supporters drew hope from his incorrect choice for the Germany versus Spain match in the UEFA Euro 2008 but were disappointed . [ 23 ] The prediction led to German fans calling for Paul to be eaten . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In response , the Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero offered to send Paul official state protection , and the Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian called for Paul to be given safe haven in Spain . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Paul 's notoriety attracted criticism from the President of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who accused him of being a symbol of Western decadence and decay . [ 28 ] Doubts were expressed as to whether it was actually the same octopus in 2010 as it had been in 2008 . [ 29 ]",
