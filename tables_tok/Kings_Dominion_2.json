  "section_text": "Candy Apple Grove was known as Coney Island when the park first opened in 1975 . It was renamed Candy Apple Grove in 1976 . The area is Kings Dominion 's largest section in the park , and in its early years , it featured an orchard theme that included three apple-themed rides : Apple Turnover , [ 38 ] Bad Apple , and Adam 's Apple . Much of the apple-related themes were removed over the years , and the area became known as simply The Grove when it merged with the former Wayne 's World area in 2001 . [ citation needed ] As part of Kings Dominion 's 40th-anniversary celebration in 2014 , The Grove was restored to its original orchard theme , and the name was changed back to Candy Apple Grove . The animatronic Singing Mushrooms , popular decades ago , was redeveloped with newer technology and placed back on display . [ 39 ] Other features that made a return to the area include a fully restored floral clock near the Carousel , oversized candy apples , and the popular blue ice cream that existed in the park for decades . [ 40 ] The westernmost corner of Candy Apple Grove , distinct from the rest of the area , is themed to the 1950s Some of the area 's more notable rides include WindSeeker , a 301-foot-tall ( 92 m ) swing ride that opened in 2012 , and Delirium , a type of pendulum amusement ride that opened in place of stand-up roller coaster Shockwave in 2016 . Candy Apple Grove 's newest ride , steel coaster Twisted Timbers , opened in 2018 replacing Hurler and reusing some of the previous support structure . In addition to rides , the area features an arcade , carnival games , fast-food restaurants , and a gift shop",
