  "intro": "Thailand competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its partial support to the United States boycott. The National Olympic Committee of Thailand sent a total of 42 athletes to the Games, 24 men and 18 women, to compete in 13 sports; the nation's team size was roughly smaller from Sydney by ten athletes. Fourteen of them had previously competed in Sydney, including featherweight boxer and 1996 Olympic champion Somluck Kamsing, and Asia's top tennis star Paradorn Srichaphan, who was later appointed by the committee to carry the Thai flag in the opening ceremony. Along with Kamsing, US-based swimmer Ratapong Sirisanont and badminton player Pramote Teerawiwatana became the first Thai athletes to compete in four Olympic Games. Among the sports played by athletes at these Games, Thailand marked its debut in equestrian and taekwondo. Thailand left Athens with a total of eight medals (three golds, one silver, and four bronze), setting a historic milestone as the nation's most successful Games in Olympic history. Thai athletes continued to dominate in boxing and weightlifting, where they each won more than two Olympic medals, including a prestigious gold from Manus Boonjumnong in light welterweight boxing, and Udomporn Polsak, and Pawina Thongsuk in women's weightlifting."
