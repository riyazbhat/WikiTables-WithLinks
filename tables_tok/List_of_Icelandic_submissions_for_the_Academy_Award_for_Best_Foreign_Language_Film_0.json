  "intro": "Iceland has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1981. The first film to be sent to AMPAS by Iceland was Land and Sons which was released in Iceland in 1980. Since then, Iceland has sent in a film every year. Only one Icelandic film, B\u00f6rn n\u00e1tt\u00farunnar (Children of Nature), directed by Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson, has received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. However, a second, Dj\u00fapi\u00f0 (The Deep), made the nine-film shortlist in 2012, and a third, S\u00ed\u00f0asti b\u00e6rinn (The Last Farm) by R\u00fanar R\u00fanarsson, was also nominated for Best Live Action Short in 2006. Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson's films have been selected to represent Iceland six times- more than any other Icelandic director. \u00c1g\u00fast Gu\u00f0mundsson, Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur and Hrafn Gunnlaugsson have each represented Iceland four times. In 1990, Gu\u00f0n\u00fd Halld\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir became the first Icelandic woman to represent the country."
