  "intro": "The Artistic Gymnastics World Championships were held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1996. The team and all around events were not contested at the 1996 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships. The format was similar to that of the 1992 and 2002 Worlds, with medals being awarded for the individual WAG and MAG apparatus. There were three rounds of competition: the preliminary round open to everyone; the semi-finals open to the top sixteen qualifiers; and the finals for the top eight gymnasts. The 1996 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships were also the last be held in the same year as a Summer Olympics."
