  "section_text": "The Southeast Asian Games features numerous non-Olympic sports in its programme , reflecting the popularity of some sports to the region , or as a means of introducing more obscure sports to the region and beyond . [ 2 ] Some sports dropped from the Olympic programme may still be retained in the SEAG , although the games does not feature all of the Olympic sports , often in favour of the traditional ones .

  "intro": "This is a list of sports played in the biennial Southeast Asian Games. Unlike the Olympic games, there are no official limits to the number of sports which may be contested, and the range may be decided by the organising host pending approval by the Southeast Asian Games Federation. Albeit for some core sports which must be featured, the host is also free to introduce other sports. Over time, this has meant as much as 43 sports in the 24th edition of the games, and the programme has included relatively obscure sports such as arnis, finswimming and p\u00e9tanque. In the 30th edition of the Games, there are medals in 56 different sports that will be contested -- the most in its history."
