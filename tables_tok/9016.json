It was around 4:45 p.m. when authorities were called to a residence in the 1400 block of East First North Street . When police arrived at the scene , they discovered 85-year-old Dorothy Hamilton dead in the living room of her home . Investigators also found a pair of aggressive pit bulls inside of the house . Animal control put down the two dogs that were inside the house when police found Hamilton . Authorities said that the dogs were being held in a bedroom , but it looks as though they broke down the door in order to attack the woman ."
