Four teams play in two semifinal games , with the winners advancing to the College Football Playoff National Championship . [ 58 ] Six bowl games \u2014 the Rose Bowl , Sugar Bowl , Orange Bowl , Cotton Bowl , Fiesta Bowl , and Peach Bowl \u2014 will rotate as hosts for the semifinal games , and host major bowls when they do not host semifinal games ( access bowls ) . With the birth of the College Football Playoff , The American lost its automatic qualifying status for one of the major bowls . Instead , one automatic qualifying spot is reserved for the highest ranked team from the `` Group of Five '' conferences \u2013 The American , Conference USA , the Mid-American Conference , Mountain West Conference , and Sun Belt Conference . Although the pick order usually corresponds to the conference standings , the bowls are not required to make their choices strictly according to the won-lost records ; many factors influence bowl selections , especially the likely turnout of the team 's fans . Picks are made after any applicable College Football Playoff selections . If a team is selected for the one of the access bowls or playoff , the bowl with the No . 2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference .",

  "intro": "The American Athletic Conference (The American or AAC), is an American collegiate athletic conference, featuring 12 member universities and six associate member universities that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Member universities represent a range of private and public universities of various enrollment sizes located primarily in urban metropolitan areas in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the United States. The American's legal predecessor, the original Big East Conference, was considered one of the six collegiate power conferences of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era in college football, and The American inherited that status in the BCS's final season. With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, The American became a Group of Five conference, which shares one automatic spot in the New Year's Six bowl games. [note 3]\n The league is the product of substantial turmoil in the old Big East during the 2010-14 conference realignment period. It is one of two conferences to emerge from the all-sports Big East in 2013. While the other successor, which does not sponsor football, purchased the Big East Conference name, The American inherited the old Big East's structure and is that conference's legal successor. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013. The American is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, and led by Commissioner Michael Aresco."
