  "intro": "The NCAA Bowling Championship is a sanctioned women's championship in college athletics. Unlike many NCAA sports, only one championship is held each season with teams from Division I, Division II, and Division III competing together. Twelve teams, eight of them automatic qualifiers and the other four being at-large selections, are chosen by the NCAA Bowling Committee to compete in the championships. The championship was first held in April 2004. The most successful team is Nebraska with 5 titles. The reigning champions are Stephen F. Austin (SFA), which won the 2019 title 4 games to 1 against the defending champions Vanderbilt. This is SFA's second NCAA Bowling Championship. Nebraska is the only program to qualify for all 16 NCAA Bowling Championships."
