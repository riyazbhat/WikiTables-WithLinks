  "section_text": "This list of Ivy League business schools outlines the six universities of the Ivy League that host a business school . The creation of business schools at Ivy League universities occurred over a period of nearly a century , beginning with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , founded in 1881 by Joseph Wharton , which was the first collegiate ( undergraduate ) business school in the world . [ 1 ] In 1900 , the Tuck School at Dartmouth was founded as the world 's first graduate school of business ; and in 1921 , Harvard Business School became the first business school to offer the MBA degree Two Ivy League institutions , Brown University and Princeton University , do not have business schools .

Brown offers a Business Economics track within its Commerce , Organizations and Entrepreneurship undergraduate concentration , [ 2 ] and a joint MBA program with Spain 's Instituto de Empresa Business School .
