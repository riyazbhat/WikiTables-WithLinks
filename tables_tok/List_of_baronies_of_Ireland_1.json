The Municipal Corporations ( Ireland ) Act 1840 ( 3 & 4 Vict . c.108 ) separated the rural hinterland or `` liberties '' from some of the counties corporate , restricting their jurisdiction to the relevant municipal town , borough , or city . The Counties and Boroughs ( Ireland ) Act 1840 ( 3 & 4 Vict . c.109 ) provided that the rural area would form a new barony of the adjacent county until the county Grand Jury should decide to allocate it to an existing barony . The reallocation happened quickly in some cases , slower in others , and not at all in three cases : the baronies of Cork [ 85 ] and Galway , [ 86 ] and the Louth barony of Drogheda .",
