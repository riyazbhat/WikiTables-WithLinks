  "intro": "Klubi i Futbollit Tirana is an Albanian football club based in the country's capital city, Tirana. The men's football club is part of the multi-disciplinary sports club SK Tirana, and is the most successful in Albania, having won 51 recognized major domestic trophies. They play their home games at the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium in Tirana and they play in the Albanian Superliga. The club was founded on 15 August 1920 as Shoqata Sportive Agimi (in English: Agimi Sports Association) and they had since participated in all the top tier national championships ever held in Albania. However the ninth-place finish in the 2016-17 season relegated the club to the Albanian First Division (second-tier) for the first time in their history. They have competed under the name of SK Tirana between 1927 and 1947, when the communist regime forcibly renamed the club 17 N\u00ebntori Tirana, Puna Tirana and KS 17 N\u00ebntori. In 1991 KF Tirana retook its pre-1947 name and was divided into two branches, the multi disciplinary SK Tirana and the football branch of KF Tirana. KF Tirana is the most successful Albanian team in European competitions, having progressed from the first rounds on 11 occasions since making their European debut in the 1965-66 European Cup. They reached Round of 16 in European Competitions four times, three such in the European Cup (now Champions League) alone in 1980s. The club also holds the record of being the highest ever ranking Albanian club according to IFFHS, having been ranked 31st in the world in 1987, following good results in their 1986-87 campaign. In addition, KF Tirana is an ECA member."
