  "intro": "Leeds United appointed Marcelo Bielsa as their manager on 15 June 2018, having sacked their 10th manager in the past 5 seasons on 1 June 2018. The following is a list of managers of Leeds United Association Football Club and their major honours from the beginning of the club's official managerial records in 1919 to the present day. Each manager's entry includes the dates of his tenure and the club's overall competitive record (in terms of matches won, drawn and lost) and honours won while under his care. As of 15 June 2018, Leeds United have had 37 full-time managers. There have also been nine caretaker managers, three of whom had previously occupied the role on a full-time basis, and one of whom has occupied the role three times. The most successful person to manage Leeds United is Don Revie, who won two League Championships, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one Division Two Championship, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Charity Shield in his 13-year reign as manager. He is also the club's longest-serving manager, presiding over a total of 740 games from 1961 to 1974."
