  "section_text": "In addition to on-disc songs , players can purchase additional downloadable content for The Beatles : Rock Band from their console 's respective online stores . Unlike other console games in the Rock Band series , downloadable content for The Beatles : Rock Band is not playable in the other games , nor will The Beatles : Rock Band use content from the other games . [ 12 ] Part of this is due to new Dreamscapes that have been created for the downloadable songs . [ 13 ] To date , one song ( `` All You Need Is Love '' ) and the remaining songs from three albums not already on-disc have been released as downloadable content ; future content will depend on the sales performance of these tracks , as Harmonix has stated the costs to produce these tracks\u2014including travel to Abbey Road studios and their engineers ' time\u2014are more expensive than their regular Rock Band downloadable songs . [ 14 ] All individual songs ( including the two- or three-song segments from the Abbey Road medley ) are priced at $ 1.99 ( 160 Microsoft Points/200 Wii Points ) and are available for download through the PlayStation Network , Xbox Live and the in-game Music Store on the Wii . The first album to be released as downloadable content , Abbey Road , is priced at $ 16.98 ( 1360 Microsoft Points ) as a whole . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Unique to Abbey Road , those that purchase the full album are able to play the entire medley as a single song in addition to the smaller segments offered . [ 15 ] The download of `` All You Need Is Love '' was originally exclusive to Xbox 360 at launch , with the proceeds of over $ 200,000 donated to the charity Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res . It was later released for Wii on February 16 , 2010 and for PlayStation 3 on March 4 , 2010 . [ 18 ] All downloadable content for The Beatles : Rock Band was removed from sale on the respective storefronts on May 5 , 2016 , as the licensing contracts with the rights holder have expired , though players that have already purchased this content will still be able to download the songs .

  "intro": "The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts, in association with Apple Corps. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series and is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii consoles. The game allows one to six players to simulate the performance of songs by the Beatles by providing the players with peripherals modelled after musical instruments (a guitar peripheral for lead guitar and bass gameplay, a drum peripheral, and a microphone). The gameplay mechanics of the game are similar to those found in other Rock Band games, in which players use the instrument controllers to match scrolling on-screen notes in time to the music to score points. The 45-song selection of the Beatles' music on the game's disc was praised by critics, considering the list to be emotional, sentimental and a good cross-section of the band's catalogue. Compared to other music video games released previously, the number of tracks in The Beatles: Rock Band was considered small, and the inclusion of certain lesser-known songs, and the exclusion of more popular ones, was considered confusing. In addition to the on-disc songs, The Beatles: Rock Band features downloadable content, in the form of both singles and full albums (excluding those songs already on disc), allowing players to play through the album in a single session, once the album has been obtained."
