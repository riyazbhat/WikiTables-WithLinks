  "intro": "The Confederation of the Rhine (German: Rheinbund; French: officially \u00c9tats conf\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s du Rhin (Confederated States of the Rhine), but in practice Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Rhin) was a confederation of client states of the First French Empire. It was formed initially from sixteen German states by Napoleon after he defeated Austria and Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz. The Treaty of Pressburg, in effect, led to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, which lasted from 1806 to 1813. The members of the confederation were German princes (F\u00fcrsten) formerly within the Holy Roman Empire. They were later joined by 19 others, altogether ruling a total of over 15 million subjects providing a significant strategic advantage to the French Empire on its eastern frontier by providing a separation between France and the two largest German states, Prussia and Austria (which also controlled substantial non-German lands to its north, east and south), to the east, which were not members of the Confederation of the Rhine."
