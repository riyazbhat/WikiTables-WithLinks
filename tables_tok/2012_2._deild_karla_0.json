  "intro": "The 2012 2. deild karla was the 47th season of third-tier football in Iceland. The league, which was contested by 12 clubs from across Iceland, began on 11 May 2012 and ended on 22 September 2012. The champions of the 2. deild karla in the 2012 season were V\u00f6lsungur, who sealed the title on the final day of the season with a 2-1 home win against Njar\u00f0v\u00edk. V\u00f6lsungur were consequently promoted to the 1. deild karla for the 2013 season along with runners-up KF, who finished ahead of third-placed HK because of their superior goal difference. At the opposite end of the table KFR, who had been promoted to the 2. deild for the 2012 campaign, finished bottom of the league after winning only one of their 22 matches. Also relegated to the 3. deild karla (which will be played in a new format in 2013) were Fjar\u00f0abygg\u00f0, who ended the season five points from safety. There were two joint top goalscorers for the season who both scored 18 goals in the league: KF striker \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur Birgisson and Bessi V\u00ed\u00f0isson of Dalv\u00edk/Reynir, who reached the tally with a five-goal haul in the 9-0 victory over KFR on the last day of the campaign. Bessi played fewer games though and as such was named as the top scorer."
