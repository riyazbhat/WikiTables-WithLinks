  "intro": "Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American actress and filmmaker. She is the eldest daughter of actor and director Ron Howard. She attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but left before graduating to take on roles on Broadway. While appearing in a 2003 production of As You Like It, Howard caught the attention of director M. Night Shyamalan, who cast her in the psychological thriller The Village (2004). It proved to be her breakout role and she subsequently starred in the title role of Shyamalan's fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh's As You Like It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination, and she appeared as Gwen Stacy in Sam Raimi's superhero film Spider-Man 3 (2007). Howard went on to appear in the action film Terminator Salvation (2009) and the fantasy film The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010), both of which were financially successful but garnered mixed reviews from critics. Howard had supporting roles in the acclaimed 2011 comedy-dramas 50/50 and The Help. She gained wider recognition for starring as Claire Dearing in the adventure film Jurassic World (2015) and its sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), which rank as her most financially successful films. She also had a starring role in the adventure film Pete's Dragon (2016) and a supporting role in the Elton John biopic Rocketman (2019). Howard's directorial ventures include the television drama film Call Me Crazy: A Five Film (2013), the documentary Dads (2019), and an episode of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian (2019). She is married to the actor Seth Gabel, with whom she has two children."
