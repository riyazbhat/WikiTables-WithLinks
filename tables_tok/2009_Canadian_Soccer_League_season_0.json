  "intro": "The 2009 Canadian Soccer League season was the 12th since its establishment where a total of 17 teams from Ontario and Quebec took part in the league. The season began on May 15, 2008, and ended on October 24 where for the second straight season the Serbian White Eagles faced Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Attak at the CSL Championship. The Attak denied Serbia their championship title by defeating them 3-2 in a penalty shootout. The victory marked the organizations first championship title, and made CSL history by becoming the first Quebec club to claim it. Throughout the regular season both Serbia, and Trois-Rivieres won their respective divisions. The season marked a historic year for the league as it became the first league in 16 years to receive conditional membership in the Canadian Soccer Association. Allowing the CSL to create an effective player developmental system in order to provide the missing link between the top provincial amateur level to the MLS/USL. The league received more coverage with Rogers TV committing to broadcasting a full 23-game schedule every Saturday night through to the finals. While the Reserve Division expanded to include 7 teams with TFC Academy II winning their first piece of silverware."
