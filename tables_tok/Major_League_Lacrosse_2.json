  "intro": "Major League Lacrosse (MLL) is a men's field lacrosse league consisting of six active teams in the United States. The league's inaugural season was in 2001. Teams play 16 regular-season games from late May to late September, with a four-team playoff for the championship trophy, the Steinfeld Trophy. MLL averaged 3,619 spectators per game during the 2018 season, down from a peak of 6,417 in 2011. As a semi-professional league, MLL players earn annual salaries in the $10,000-$25,000 range. Players and staff generally hold other jobs and the league does not provide health insurance coverage. The current champion is the Chesapeake Bayhawks, who defeated the Denver Outlaws 10-9 in the 2019 Championship Game at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Denver, Colorado."
