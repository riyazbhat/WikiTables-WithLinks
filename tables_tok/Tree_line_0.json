  "section_text": "Like the alpine tree lines shown above , polar tree lines are heavily influenced by local variables such as aspect of slope and degree of shelter . In addition , permafrost has a major impact on the ability of trees to place roots into the ground . When roots are too shallow , trees are susceptible to windthrow and erosion . Trees can often grow in river valleys at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site . Maritime influences such as ocean currents also play a major role in determining how far from the equator trees can grow as well as the warm summers experienced in extreme continental climates . In northern inland Scandinavia there is substantial maritime influence on high parallels that keep winters relatively mild , but enough inland effect to have summers well above the threshold for the tree line . Here are some typical polar treelines :",
  "uid": "Tree_line_0",
  "intro": "The tree line is the edge of the habitat at which trees are capable of growing. It is found at high elevations and high latitudes. Beyond the tree line, trees cannot tolerate the environmental conditions (usually cold temperatures or associated lack of available moisture). :51 The tree line is sometimes distinguished from a lower timberline or forest line, which is the line below which trees form a forest with a closed canopy. :151:18\n At the tree line, tree growth is often sparse, stunted, and deformed by wind and cold. This is sometimes known as krummholz (German for crooked wood). :58\n The tree line often appears well-defined, but it can be a more gradual transition. Trees grow shorter and often at lower densities as they approach the tree line, above which they cease to exist. :55"
