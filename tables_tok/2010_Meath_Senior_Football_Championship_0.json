  "intro": "The 2010 Meath Senior Football Championship was the 118th edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Meath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 17 teams, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage, and then progresses to a knock out stage. Seneschalstown were the defending champions after they defeated Wolfe Tones, after a replay, in the previous year's final. Oldcastle were promoted after claiming the 2009 Meath Intermediate Football Championship title, their first year in the senior grade since being relegated in 2002. On 26 September 2010, Skryne claimed their 13th Senior Championship title when they defeated Seneschalstown 0-21 to 4-8 in a very entertaining final. The game looked like it would go to extra time, but with the last kick of the game, Skryne's Paddy O'Rourke scored a 45 and sealed the win for Skryne. Aidan Tuite, the Skryne captain, lifted the Keegan Cup while Paddy O'Rourke claimed the 'Man of the Match' award. St. Ultan's were relegated after just 2 years as a senior club."
