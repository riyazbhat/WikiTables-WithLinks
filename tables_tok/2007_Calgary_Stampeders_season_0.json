  "intro": "The 2007 Calgary Stampeders season was the 50th season for the team in the Canadian Football League and their 69th overall. After promising 2nd-place finishes in the West Division in 2005 (11-7) and 2006 (10-8) they finished 3rd in the West Division in 2007, with a disappointing 7-10-1 record, their first losing record in three seasons. They were defeated in the Western Semi-Final 26-24 by the eventual Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. The season was the last in which the team recorded more than two consecutive losses in the regular season in 10 years, recording three consecutive losses to close out the 2017 Calgary Stampeders season."
