It has been organised since 2001. It is one of the biggest and most popular film festivals in Poland. Since 2008 it is accredited by FIAPF with an avant-garde specialised competitive status. The event is organized by the Stowarzyszenie Nowe Horyzonty (New Horizons Association). The moving spirit and the director of the festival is Roman Gutek. T-Mobile mobile phone network operator was a nominal sponsor of the event until 2017. Festival presents mainly arthouse cinema. The most important from the several competitions held at the festival (including new Polish films, films-on-art and short films contests) is the New horizons international competition. It aims to present bold, unconventional and uncompromising films that are searching for the new forms of expression - the new horizons of cinema. Prizes in the competition are: the Grand Prix, special mentions, and Audience Award. Since 2010 also a FIPRESCI Award is awarded."
