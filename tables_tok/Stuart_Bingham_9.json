  "intro": "Stuart Bingham (born 21 May 1976) is an English professional snooker player. He was World Champion in 2015, beating Shaun Murphy 18-15 in the final, and is currently the defending Masters champion, winning in 2020. Bingham became the oldest Masters champion in history aged 43 years and 243 days old with this win. As an amateur, he won the 1996 IBSF World Snooker Championship. He first entered the top 32 in the world rankings for the 2006/2007 season, and first reached the top 16 during the 2011/2012 season. Bingham won the first ranking title of his career at the 2011 Australian Goldfields Open and his second ranking title at the 2014 Shanghai Masters. He followed this by winning the World Championship in 2015, which British media said completed an astonishing transition from journeyman to king of the Crucible. With that, he joined Ken Doherty as the only players to have won world titles at both amateur and professional levels. He claimed a fourth ranking title by winning the 2017 Welsh Open. Bingham has also been runner-up in three other ranking events, the 2012 Wuxi Classic, the 2013 Welsh Open, and the 2016 World Grand Prix. He has also won the non-ranking 2012 Premier League Snooker and the 2015 Championship League. A prolific break-builder, he has compiled more than 400 century breaks during his career, including six maximum breaks."
