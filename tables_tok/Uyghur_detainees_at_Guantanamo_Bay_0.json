  "intro": "Starting in 2002, the United States government detained twenty-two Uyghurs in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. The last three Uyghur detainees, Yusef Abbas, Hajiakbar Abdulghupur and Saidullah Khalik, were not freed from Guantanamo until December 29, 2013, when they were transferred to Slovakia. Uyghurs are an ethnic group from Central Asia and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China. The Washington Post reported on August 24, 2005, that fifteen Uyghurs had been determined to be No longer enemy combatants (NLECs). The Post reported that detainees who had been classified as NLEC were, not only still being incarcerated, but one was shackled to the floor for reasons not disclosed by his attorney. Five of these Uyghurs, who had filed for writs of habeas corpus, were transported to Albania on May 5, 2006, just prior to a scheduled judicial review of their petitions. The other seventeen obtained writs of habeas corpus in 2008."
