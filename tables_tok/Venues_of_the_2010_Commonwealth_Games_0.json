  "intro": "The 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XIX Commonwealth Games, were held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 nations in the Commonwealth of Nations competed in 272 events in 21 sports. The games were the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and in India, eclipsing the 1982 Asian Games that Delhi hosted. Events took place at twelve competition venues, and twenty venues were set aside as training venues. Other venues in the games included the Commonwealth Games Village and the Main Media Centre. The Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee, whose headquarters was situated in the New Delhi Municipal Council building, was established to organise the event. A total of five venues were newly constructed for the games; the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the Thyagaraj Sports Complex, the Yamuna Sports Complex as well as a rugby sevens facility in Delhi University Stadium. This does not include the two venues - the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex - that received major renovations or an uplift. All other venues had existed prior to the games. The Commonwealth Games Village was a separate non-competitive venue that provided accommodation and activities for the athletes. The largest venue was the Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, which had a capacity of 60,000 during the games. The stadium was the main venue of the games, hosting both the opening and the closing ceremonies."
