  "intro": "This is a list of notable former and current faculty and staff members of Oregon State University (OSU), a four-year research and degree-granting public university in Corvallis, Oregon in the United States. The university traces its roots back to 1856 when Corvallis Academy was founded. It was not formally incorporated until 1858 when the name was changed to Corvallis College, and wasn't chartered until 1868, when the name was changed to Corvallis College and Agricultural College of Oregon. The university changed names several more times, adopting its current name in 1961. [i] Faculty and staff from each of these eras may be included on the list, and more than 2,900 people are currently employed there."
