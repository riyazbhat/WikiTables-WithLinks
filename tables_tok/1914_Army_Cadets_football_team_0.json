  "intro": "The 1914 Army Cadets football team represented the United States Military Academy in the 1914 college football season. In their second season under head coach Charles Dudley Daly, the Cadets compiled a 9-0 record, shut out six of their nine opponents, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 219 to 20 - an average of 24.3 points scored and 2.2 points allowed. In the annual Army-Navy Game, the Cadets defeated the Midshipmen 20 to 0. The Cadets also defeated Notre Dame \nThe team was recognized as the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation, the Houlgate System, and the National Championship Foundation, and a co-national champion by Parke H. Davis. Three Army players were recognized as first-team players on the All-America team: end Louis A. Merrilat; center John McEwan; and quarterback Vernon Prichard. Tackle Alex Weyand was selected as a third-team All-American by Walter Camp. Four players from the 1914 team were later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: McEwan; Weyand; Robert Neyland (later coach at Tennessee); and Elmer Oliphant."
