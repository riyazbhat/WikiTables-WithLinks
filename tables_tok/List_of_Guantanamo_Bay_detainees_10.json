  "intro": "As of May 1, 2018, 40 detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay, according to the Federal government of the United States. This list of Guant\u00e1namo prisoners has the known identities of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, but is compiled from various sources and is incomplete. In official documents, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) continues to make intermittent efforts to redact prisoner's names, and has not published an official list of detainees (as of September 2005[update]). On April 19, 2006, the DoD released a list with 558 names in what appears to be a fax or other scanned image. The Associated Press published the list in more accessible text form. The Washington Post maintains a list of the prisoners known or suspected to have been held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. On March 3, 2006 the DoD partially complied with a court order to release the names of the remaining Guant\u00e1namo detainees. The court order required the DoD to release the names of all the detainees. Initially, the DoD released only 317 names. On April 19, 2006, the DoD released a list with 558 names. Although Justice Jed Rakoff had already dismissed this argument, Pentagon spokesmen Bryan Whitman justified withholding the names out of a concern for the detainees' privacy. On April 20, 2006, the DoD released a portable document format file that listed 558 names."
