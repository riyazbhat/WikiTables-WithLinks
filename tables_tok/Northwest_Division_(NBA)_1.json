  "intro": "The Northwest Division is one of the three divisions in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The division consists of five teams: the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Utah Jazz. The division was created at the start of the 2004-05 season, when the league expanded from 29 to 30 teams with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats. The league realigned itself into three divisions in each conference. The Northwest Division began with five inaugural members: the Nuggets, the Timberwolves, the Trail Blazers, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Jazz. The Trail Blazers and SuperSonics joined from the Pacific Division, while the Nuggets, the Timberwolves and Jazz joined from the now-defunct Midwest Division. The most recent division champion is the Denver Nuggets, having won its fourth division championship in the 2018-19 NBA season. The SuperSonics-Thunder franchise has won the most Northwest Division titles, with six, while the Nuggets have won four, the Jazz have won three, the Trail Blazers have won two, and the Timberwolves have never won the Northwest Division title. In the 2009-10 season, all four teams that qualified for the playoffs each had more than 50 wins, and in 2018-19 all four teams that qualified for the playoffs had at least 49 wins."
