Many of the buildings were built to house Masonic meetings and ritual activities in their upper floors, and to provide commercial space below. Many of the buildings listed have received landmark status, either by being listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listed by various State or City preservation agencies. In 2019, more than 390 Masonic buildings are listed here."
