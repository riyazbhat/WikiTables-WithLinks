  "intro": "The Southwest Division is one of the three divisions in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The division is located in the South Central United States and consists of five teams, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Rockets, the Memphis Grizzlies, the New Orleans Pelicans and the San Antonio Spurs. Three of the teams, the Mavericks, Rockets, and Spurs, are based in Texas. Consisting of some of the most historically competitive teams in the NBA's Western Conference, the division was created at the start of the 2004-05 season, when the league expanded from 29 to 30 teams with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats. The league realigned itself into three divisions in each conference. The Southwest Division began with five inaugural members, the Mavericks, the Rockets, the Grizzlies, the Hornets (now Pelicans) and the Spurs. The Mavericks, the Rockets, the Grizzlies and the Spurs joined from the now-defunct Midwest Division, while the Pelicans joined from the Central Division. The Spurs have been dominant since the division's inaugural season, having won the most Southwest Division titles with nine. The Mavericks and Rockets have won two titles each, and the Pelicans have won one title. The Grizzlies have never won the Southwest Division title. Four NBA champions came from the Southwest Division. The Spurs won the NBA championship in 2005, 2007 and 2014, while the Mavericks won in 2011."
