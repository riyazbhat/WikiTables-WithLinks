  "intro": "Centered in Lima , Ohio , the Western Buckeye League is an OHSAA athletic league located in northwest Ohio and includes schools in Allen , Auglaize , Defiance , Hardin , Mercer , Putnam , and Van Wert counties. The league's school district boundaries also include portions of Logan , Paulding , Shelby , and Wyandot counties. The WBL originally formed in 1936 and is one of the oldest high school conferences in the state. The Western Buckeye League currently awards championships in 13 Varsity sports: baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, and wrestling. An academic bowl tournament for the schools in the league began annually in 2004. While the WBL consists of larger schools and spreads over a larger area, it is geographically located in the same area of the state as the Midwest Athletic Conference . Most schools out of both leagues typically host hotly contested matchups in nearly every sport."
