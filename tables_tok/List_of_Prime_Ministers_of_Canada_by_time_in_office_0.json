First term : King began his first term after winning a narrow majority government in the election of 1921 , defeating Prime Minister Meighen . His government fluctuated between majority and minority over the course of four years , due to by-elections and political developments . He won a minority government in the 1925 election , but that government was cut short by the King-Byng Affair . To avoid a motion of censure in the Commons , King asked the Governor General , Viscount Byng to call an election . The Governor General refused and King resigned . The Governor General appointed Meighen as prime minister , but Meighen 's government fell after only four days in office , triggering a general election , which King won . Second term : King began his second term when he won a minority government in the 1926 election . His second term lasted until 1930 , when he was defeated by R.B . Bennett in the 1930 general election and resigned as prime minister . He stayed on as party leader and became Leader of the Opposition . Third term : King began his third and longest term when he won the election of 1935 , defeating Prime Minister Bennett and winning a majority government . He won the subsequent elections in 1940 and 1945 , and retired in 1948 . He was succeeded by Louis St. Laurent",

First term : When Borden announced his retirement in 1920 , the Conservative party caucus asked him to recommend his successor . After consulting with the individual members of caucus , he recommended that Meighen be the new party leader . The caucus accepted that recommendation and Meighen became party leader and prime minister . He governed for just over a year with a majority in the parliament elected under Borden 's leadership in the 1917 election , then called the general election of 1921 . He was defeated by King , who won a narrow majority government . Meighen resigned as prime minister , but remained as party leader . He had lost his own seat , but was elected in a by-election and returned to Parliament in January , 1922 . He served as Leader of the Opposition for the next four years . Second term : Meighen served a second term of just under three months in 1926 . In the 1925 election , Meighen and the Conservatives won more seats than King and the Liberals , but did not win a majority . King was able to keep governing with the support of the Progressives until he faced a motion of censure in the Commons in the spring of 1926 . The Governor General refused King 's request for a dissolution of Parliament and King resigned as prime minister . Governor General Byng then appointed Meighen as Prime Minister , but Meighen 's government fell within four days , defeated in Parliament . The Governor General now granted the dissolution of Parliament , triggering a general election . Meighen lost the 1926 election to King and again was defeated in his own riding . He resigned as prime minister for the second time",
