  "section_text": "Prior to 1989 , any borough with a population exceeding 20,000 could proclaim itself a city . As part of the restructuring , many provincial cities were combined with surrounding rural counties to form districts . For example , Hastings became a district , although its population is greater than nearby city Napier , which did not acquire any rural areas . The term city is still used informally for all large towns . New Zealand 's first city was Christchurch , proclaimed by royal charter in 1856 . [ 78 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_former_territorial_authorities_in_New_Zealand_1",
  "intro": "Territorial authority is the generic term used for local government entities in New Zealand. Local government has gone through three principal phases with different structures: the provincial era, from 1853 to 1876; the counties and boroughs system from 1876 until 1989; and the current system of regions, cities and districts. This article attempts to list all territorial authorities which have been disestablished."
