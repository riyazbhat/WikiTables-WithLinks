Marine infantry battalions often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms , infantry crew-served weapons ( e.g. , heavy machine guns , medium mortars , and anti-tank missiles ) , and a few light tactical trucks . Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as light infantry , and must be supplemented with additional trucks to become motorized infantry or Amphibious Assault Vehicles to become mechanized infantry A Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three rifle companies , a weapons company , and a headquarters and service company . The rifle company has a company headquarters , three rifle platoons , with three rifle squads each , and a weapons platoon with medium machineguns , mortars , and assault weapons sections . The weapons company includes a company headquarters , a heavy machinegun platoon , an 81mm mortar platoon , and an antiarmor platoon .
