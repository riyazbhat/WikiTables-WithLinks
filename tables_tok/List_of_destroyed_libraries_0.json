        "Bishop De Landa , a Franciscan monk and conquistador during the Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n , wrote : We found a large number of books in these characters and , as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil , we burned them all , which they ( the Maya ) regretted to an amazing degree , and which caused them much affliction . Only three extant codices are widely considered unquestionably authentic",

  "intro": "Libraries have been deliberately or accidentally destroyed or badly damaged. Sometimes a library is purposely destroyed as a form of cultural cleansing. There are examples of accidentally destroyed libraries by human actions. Other times they are damaged by natural disasters like earthquakes, floods or accidental fires. Library fires have happened sporadically through the centuries: notable examples are the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, destruction of Library of Nalanda in India and the accidental burning of the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar. Causes vary from arson to the sun's rays setting fire to leaflets through the action of a magnifying lens, as happened to a library in Northam, Devon."
