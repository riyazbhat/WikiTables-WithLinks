  "section_text": "Further information : World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series In 2019 , World Rugby announced a plan to create a second tier competition that would allow the best thirteen sevens teams , with the addition of three invited teams , from their region to compete in a similar style format to the Sevens Series for the potential of gaining promotion to the World Rugby Sevens Series and becoming a core team . [ 32 ] This breaks from the usual format of promotion and relegation in the sevens series The proposal was well received from the Tongan rugby sevens team , whom will be one of the sixteen teams competing in the tournament . Coach Tevita Tu'ifua said about the news , `` We are so excited and very happy and it is a blessing for us to get involved in any tournament for the sake of the rugby sevens programme back home . `` [ 33 ] From 2013\u201314 series to 2018\u201319 the promotion/relegation was as follows : [ 15 ] One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year . The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated . The team that wins the 12-team qualifying tournament at the Hong Kong Sevens is promoted From 2020 onwards the style of promotion/relegation will be as such : One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year . The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated to the Challenger Series . Eight teams will compete for promotion in the Hong Kong Sevens event after qualifying through the Challenger Series",
