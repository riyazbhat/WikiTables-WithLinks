  "intro": "Algeria has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1969. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. As of 2019[update], four Algerian films have been nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and one of these films, Costa-Gavras' Z, has won the award. The other two directors to have Algerian films accepted as nominees are Ettore Scola and Rachid Bouchareb. Scola's Le Bal was accepted as a nominee at the 56th Academy Awards. Bouchareb has had two films accepted as nominees: Dust of Life at the 68th Academy Awards and Days of Glory at the 79th Academy Awards, but neither of his other submissions were accepted as nominees."
