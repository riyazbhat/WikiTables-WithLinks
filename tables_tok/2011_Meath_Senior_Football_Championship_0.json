  "intro": "The 2011 Meath Senior Football Championship is the 119th edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Meath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 17 teams, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. Skryne were the defending champions after they defeated Seneschalstown in the previous years final. Nobber were promoted after claiming the 2010 Meath Intermediate Football Championship title, their first year in the senior grade since being relegated in 1991 and only their 2nd ever period as a senior club. On 16 October 2011, Summerhill claimed their 6th senior championship title when they defeated Dunshaughlin 0-14 to 1-9 after extra-time in a replay. Tony McDonnell raised the Keegan Cup for the 'Hill while Adrian Kenny claimed the 'Man of the Match' award. Trim were relegated after 62 years as a senior club. Skryne are the only club to have operated at the senior grade for longer."
