It was the first Commission where larger member-states did not have two Commissioners and the first full Commission following the 2004 enlargement . From 2004 there were 25 members , raising to 27 from 2007 . There were 9 women in the college as of 3 March 2008 and no ethnic minorities , [ 1 ] Barroso had stated he wished for more women in his Commission , than in previous Commissions , and he would use his influence over national capitals to gain this . [ 15 ] Most Commissioners ( 20 ) were born in the 1940s and 1950s with the youngest member being Olli Rehn ( b . 1962 ) and the oldest being Jacques Barrot ( b . 1937 ) . [ 1 ] Most members were former ministers with links to the Union , for example being Foreign Minister , Minister for European Affairs or represented their country in accession talks or at the European Convention . In addition to Barroso both Siim Kallas and Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla were former Prime Ministers . Viviane Reding was the only Commissioner with a background in the European Parliament . [ 1 ] Politically they came from each of the major political parties ; the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party ( 8 ) , the European People 's Party ( 8 ) and the Party of European Socialists ( 6 ) . In addition there were 4 Independents and one member of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations . [ 1 ] Barroso had been complimented for balancing the portfolios between countries , such as between small and large , new and old , and pro- and anti- ( Iraq ) war . [ 69 ] Before 2007 there were only 7 Liberals and 3 Independents . [ 1 ]",
