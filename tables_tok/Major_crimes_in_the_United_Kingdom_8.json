After the murders , the ex-girlfriend of Neville and June 's adoptive son , Jeremy Bamber - the only surviving member of the immediate family - told police that Bamber had implicated himself . The prosecution argued that , motivated by a large inheritance , he had killed the family and placed the gun in his unstable sister 's hands to make it look like a murder-suicide , which the police had originally treated the crime as , and which had been widely reported in the media immediately afterwards",

Du fled the murder scene in the Ding 's rented car ; he drove to London and travelled to Paris by coach . He continued through France , Spain and finally to Morocco , prompting a worldwide manhunt . He lived in a partly built block of flats for 14 months before he was arrested and extradited to the UK . Du was tried at Northampton Crown Court in November 2013 . He was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years",
