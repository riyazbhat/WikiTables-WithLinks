The designation was retired in 1971 with the disestablishment of the last VAH squadron ( squadrons listed below with disestablishment dates after 1971 had been redesignated RVAH squadrons by 1966 except for VAH-2 , 4 and 10 which were eventually redesignated VAQ squadrons ) . With the end of the Navy 's nuclear bomber role , the VAH squadrons based on the east coast were redesignated RVAH squadrons and were equipped with the RA-5C Vigilante Reconnaissance aircraft . VAH squadrons based on the west coast retained the VAH designation but their A-3B Skywarriors were converted to KA-3B aerial tankers . By the late 1960s , electronic jamming equipment had been added to some KA-3B tankers and those `` EKA-3B '' aircraft led to the creation of VAQ squadrons .",

  "intro": "There are hundreds of US Navy aircraft squadrons which are not currently active dating back to before World War II (the U.S. Navy operated aircraft prior to World War I, but it did not organize them in squadrons until after that war). To be more accurate: there are hundreds of former U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been disestablished and no longer exist and there are approximately 40 or so U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been deactivated and which currently exist only on paper in an inactive status. These disestablished and/or deactivated squadrons are sometimes incorrectly referred to as decommissioned squadrons, but proper usage prior to 1998, was that squadrons were established and disestablished and after 1998, squadrons are established, deactivated and sometimes reactivated. It has never been correct to refer to U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons as being commissioned and decommissioned, ships are commissioned and decommissioned, U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons are not."
