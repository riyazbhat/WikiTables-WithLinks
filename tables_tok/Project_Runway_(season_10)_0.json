  "intro": "Project Runway Season 10 is the tenth season of the television show Project Runway, appearing on Lifetime. The season began airing on July 19, 2012 with 16 designers competing to become the next great American designer. The series began filming on June 15, 2012, launching the season with a fashion show in front of a live audience. Returning as judges were supermodel Heidi Klum; fashion designer Michael Kors; and Marie Claire fashion director Nina Garcia. Tim Gunn returned as the workroom mentor. This would be the final season that Michael Kors would be a full-time judge, as he later decided he wanted to spend more of his time as a fashion designer as opposed to judging Project Runway. Lord & Taylor was the exclusive retail sponsor for Project Runway's 10th season and has merchandised the accessory wall with an assortment of products. In addition, Lord & Taylor hosted a challenge episode for the designers and for consumers on Fashion's Night Out at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Melissa Fleis, Christopher Palu and Elena Slivnyak competed in Project Runway All Stars (season 3) in 2013. Melissa placed 9th, Christopher placed 4th, and Elena placed 3rd. In 2014, Gunnar Deatherage, Fabio Costa, Sonjia Williams and Dmitry Sholokhov appeared in Project Runway All Stars (season 4). Gunnar placed 9th, Fabio placed 5th, Sonjia was the runner-up, and Dmitry won the competition."
