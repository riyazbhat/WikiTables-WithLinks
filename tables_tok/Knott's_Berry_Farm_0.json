The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery , Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand , moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station What is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott , Arizona . Walter Knott inherited his uncle 's silver mill and land , then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it . In 1966 , he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico , California into a public historic park , for which it charged an entrance/parking fee . See 'History \u2013 Ghost Town \u2013 Calico ' section above . The park formerly featured a 5th area called the Wild Water Wilderness . Formerly known as Wild Water Wilderness , now part of Ghost Town , that features two major rides : the Pony Express , a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008 and Calico River Rapids which opened in 2019 . Nearby Pony Express is Rapids Trader , a small merchandise stand . It is also home to Mystery Lodge , a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller Thrill level ( out of 5 ) [ 36 ] 1 ( low ) 2 ( mild ) 3 ( moderate ) 4 ( high ) 5 ( aggressive )",
