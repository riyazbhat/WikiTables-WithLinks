        "- - - Up to 11 people , including relatives of Maguindanao Governor Esmael Mangudadatu , and a Moro rebel were killed in a confrontation related to a dispute over a fishing ground in the province . Mangudadatu stated local officials , joined by 150 supporters , were inspecting a road project near Lake Buluan in Mangudadatu town , around 8:20 a.m. when suspected Moro rebels fired upon the gathered crowd . Eight of his supporters died at the scene of the attack while three others were transported to hospital with mortal injuries . Mangudadatu 's wife , relatives and other supporters were murdered , along with 32 journalists and staff in a 2009 massacre in Maguindanao . A civil-military relations officer confirmed the victims were to inspect a road project in Barangay Tenuk in Mangudadatu town at 15:00 when the gunmen , positioned on one side of the road , opened fire with assault rifles and B-40 anti-tank rockets . The Philippine military reported approximately 100 Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels took part in Sunday 's attack , and at least one was identified as being killed during the fighting . Numerous residents fled their homes and Army troops took positions between the two sides in an attempt to pacify them and prevent new clashes , said military spokesman Colonel Prudencio Asto , spokesman for the Army 's 6th Division . Col. Asto , confirmed that the violence stemmed from a clash between MILF troops led by Salendab and supporters of the Mangudadatus , who are locked in a two-decade-old rido or clan war with the Mangudadatus , apparently over control of strategic tracts of land in three adjoining Maguindanao towns",

The blast occurred in room 226 on the second floor of the hotel , instantly killing two people staying in two adjacent rooms , which were devastated by the blast . A third body was found on the ground floor , pinned by the cement slabs that collapsed from above . The bomb , believed to be composed of 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) of TNT powder , was so powerful it caused much of the second floor to collapse and blew off the hotel roof according to Zamboanga city Mayor Celso Lobregat . The attack has blamed on the Abu Sayyaf , and was believed to be one of two simultaneous bombings planned by the al-Qaida-linked militants . The other would have been on nearby Basilan island , where two explosives were separately found and safely defused by authorities in Isabela City",
