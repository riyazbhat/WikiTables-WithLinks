  "section_title": "Public schools -- High schools",
  "section_text": "In New South Wales , a high school generally covers Years 7 to 12 in the education system , and a central or community school , intended to provide comprehensive education in a rural district , covers Kindergarten to Year 12 . An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses . While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within the defined school boundaries , some schools are either specialist in a given Key Learning Area , or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance . In the Illawarra and South East regions , Karabar ( in Queanbeyan ) and Smith 's Hill ( in Wollongong ) are selective , whilst Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and Illawarra Sports High School are specialist . Approximately 2,000 New South Wales students attend schools in the Australian Capital Territory . The Territory has its own education system separate from the New South Wales system . Students who take this option may still apply to enrol in a New South Wales university through the University Admissions Centre upon completing year 12 .",

  "intro": "This is a list of schools in the Illawarra, South Coast, Southern Highlands, Southern Tablelands, Monaro and Snowy Mountains regions of the Australian state of New South Wales. The New South Wales education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from kindergarten to Year 6 (ages 5-12), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12 (ages 12-18)."
