        "Ralph Walter McGehee ( born 1928 ) served for 25 years in American intelligence , being a former case officer of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . From 1953 to 1972 , his assignments were in East Asia and Southeast Asia , where he held administrative posts . After leaving the Central Intelligence Agency , McGehee brought to the public his highly critical views , based on his experience . He has discussed and illustrated how the CIA 's covert actions and interventionist policies can produce unfavorable outcomes . A 1981 allegation by McGehee about CIA involvement in the Indonesian killings of 1965-1966 was censored by the CIA , prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on his behalf . The CIA prevailed",

Gravitt was laid off following his complaints to supervisors about the discrepancies . The case of Gravitt v. General Electric and Gravitt 's deposition to Congress led to federal legislation bolstering the False Claims Act in 1986 . The amended Act made it easier for whistleblowers to collect damages .

In the summer of 1985 , Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM , an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting , including noncompliance with safety procedures , the failure to issue safety compliance reports , and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant . SAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns . The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection . After he filed his report to SAFETEAM , Goldstein was fired . Subsequently , Goldstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes . The U.S. Department of Labor ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid , a finding upheld by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin . The ruling was appealed and overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers . After Goldstein lost his case , Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers",

Through litigation , it succeeded in imposing a gag order on English newspapers to prevent them from publishing Wright 's allegations . The gag orders were upheld by the Law Lords . Eventually , in 1988 , the book was cleared for legitimate sale when the Law Lords acknowledged that overseas publication meant it contained no secrets . However , Wright was barred from receiving royalties from the sale of the book in the United Kingdom . In November 1991 , the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the British government had breached the European Convention of Human Rights in gagging its own newspapers .
