  "intro": "A disappointing finish to the year for the capital outfit which flattered to deceive throughout the season. The manager changed from Cho Kwang-Rae to Lee Jang-Soo who led Chunnam Dragons to 4th place. The main striker Park Chu-Young made the sensation of the K League. A 5-3 defeat at home at the hands of lowly Gwangju Sangmu showed the team's defensive frailties for all to see. After being expected to challenge for the title, an overall position of sixth will be unacceptable but there were a few bright sparks. The chief of which was Park Chu-young, the hugely popular youngster who capped off an excellent debut year by finishing the regular season as top scorer. With national team wing-back Kim Dong-jin in the ranks as well as the promising Baek Ji-hoon in midfield."
