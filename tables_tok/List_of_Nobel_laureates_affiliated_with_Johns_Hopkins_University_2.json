  "intro": "This list of Nobel laureates affiliated with Johns Hopkins University comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of Johns Hopkins University who were awarded the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. As of October 2019, there have been 39 Nobel laureates affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, and 29 of them are officially listed as Johns Hopkins' Nobel Laureates by the university. Among the 39 laureates, 16 are Johns Hopkins' alumni (graduates and attendees), 15 are long-term faculty members and 16 are researchers (eight overlaps). Subject-wise, 18 Johns Hopkins laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other subject. Woodrow Wilson, who received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1886, was the first Johns Hopkins-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Johns Hopkins laureates: George Minot and George Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Spencer Gasser won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology in Medicine, Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."
