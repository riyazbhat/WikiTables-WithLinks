The gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees , and was originally located in Clifton . In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square , before moving to its present location . In 1975 , Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House , occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre . The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck 's 15th-century painting , The Arnolfini Portrait . Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005",

The core of the house was built in the 15th century , but it was enlarged and adapted over the centuries by the Smyth family , who bought the estate in 1545 . The south fa\u00e7ade and the wing incorrectly attributed to Inigo Jones , date from about 1633 and were extended eastwards in the 19th century . The house became derelict after the last of the Smyths died in 1946 ; it was taken over by the City in 1959 , and restoration has been an ongoing process since then . The facilities of the house are now rented out for business conferences , parties and weddings . The mansion house and stables have been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building",

Finds from the site are now held in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . Traces of decorated walls , mosaic floors , underfloor heating and bath suites were discovered . Based on the dating of coins and other evidence such as a foundation burial of a young pig , it was suggested that the site had been occupied since the third century CE .

        "The New Room was built in 1739 by John Wesley and is the oldest Methodist chapel in the world . The chapel includes a double decker pulpit , which was common at the time , and an octagonal lantern window to reduce the amount paid in Window tax . In addition to meetings and worship the New Room was used a dispensary and schoolroom for the poor people of the area . The pews and benches were made from old ship timber . The courtyards around the building contain statues of John Wesley and his brother Charles . The John Snetzler Chamber Organ of 1761 is a 20th-century addition following the restoration of the building in 1929 by Sir George Oatley . It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building , and is the only piece of land in Broadmead for which the freehold has not been bought by Bristol City Council during expansion after World War II . It now includes a visitor centre",

        "The Red Lodge Museum is open to the public is a branch of Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . It was built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a Great House , which once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall . It was subsequently added to in Georgian times . It was altered around 1730 , and restored in the early 20th century by CFW Dening . It is a grade I listed building . It has had several uses in its past , including the country 's first girls ' reform school . Below the Lodge , and entered by a door under the stairs , are some of the cells thought to belong to the Carmelite Friary , the house and grounds of which were bought by Bristol Corporation upon the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538 . The south-facing , walled garden is an excellent example of a re-created Elizabethan -style knot garden with herbaceous borders . The box hedge design is a replica of the pattern from the lodge 's bedroom ceiling . All the plants grown here could have been found in English gardens by 1630",

        "The Royal West of England Academy ( RWA ) is an art gallery . It was financed by a donation of \u00a32000 in the 1849 will of Ellen Sharples and a group of artists in Bristol , known as the Bristol Society of Artists , these were mostly landscape painters and many were well known such as William James M\u00fcller , Francis Danby , J.B. Pyne and John Syer . In 1844 , when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded , the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it . During World War II the Academy became the temporary home of various organisations including the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the U.S. Army . It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function after the intervention of the then Prime Minister , Clement Attlee . Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the Newlyn , St Ives and Bloomsbury Schools . Paintings by George Swaish , Matthew Hale , Anne Redpath , Mary Fedden , Carel Weight , Bernard Dunstan and Elizabeth Blackadder are also valued additions to the collection . The building is a grade II* listed building constructed in 1857 . The interiors are by Charles Underwood and fa\u00e7ade by JR Hirst , altered in 1912 by SS Reay and H Dare Bryan . The first floor is in 3 sections , the outer ones articulated by paired Corinthian pilasters flanking large shell head niches with statues of Flaxman and Reynolds . A large carving of 3 female figures crowns the parapet . The interior includes coloured marble",

        "The SS Great Britain was an advanced passenger steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company 's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York City . While other ships had previously been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller , Great Britain was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship . When launched in 1843 , Great Britain was by far the largest vessel afloat . However , her protracted construction and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position , and they were forced out of business in 1846 after the ship was stranded by a navigational error . Sold for salvage and repaired , Great Britain carried thousands of immigrants to Australia until converted to sail in 1881 . Three years later , the vessel was retired to the Falkland Islands where she was utilised as a warehouse , quarantine ship and coal hulk until scuttled in 1937 . In 1970 , Great Britain was returned to the Bristol dry dock where she was first built . Now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet , the vessel is an award-winning visitor attraction and museum ship in Bristol Harbour , with between 150,000-170,000 visitors annually",

  "intro": "The city, unitary authority area and ceremonial county of Bristol contains a wide range of museums, defined here as institutions (including nonprofit organisations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Non-profit art galleries and university art galleries are also included, but museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not. Many of the museums are in listed buildings. In the United Kingdom, this signifies a building which has been placed on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. In England and Wales, the authority for listing is granted by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and is administered by English Heritage. Listed buildings in danger of decay are included on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. There are three types of listed status: Grade I, for buildings of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important; Grade II*, for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, for buildings that are nationally important and of special interest. Many of the museums have been accredited by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which sets national standards for museums in the UK. Several are art galleries providing space for the exhibition of art, or are science, transport, railway, medical or religious museums. The majority of the museums are found within walking distance of Bristol Harbour and have links with the history of the port. There are also historic house museums owned or managed by Bristol City Council, the National Trust or English Heritage."
