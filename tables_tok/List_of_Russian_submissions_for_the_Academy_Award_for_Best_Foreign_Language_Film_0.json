  "intro": "Russia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1992. Prior to that, Russian films were strongly represented among the films submitted by the former Soviet Union. The Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Each year, the Academy invites countries to submit their best films for competition, with only one film being accepted from each country. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, films representing the Russian Federation have had six nominations, including one Oscar win for Burnt by the Sun. Nikita Mikhalkov has been chosen to represent Russia five times. While The Barber of Siberia was disqualified when the print did not arrive in Los Angeles in time, three other films were nominated for an Oscar."
