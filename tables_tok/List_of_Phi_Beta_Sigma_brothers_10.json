  "intro": "The list of Phi Beta Sigma notable Brothers (commonly referred to as Sigmas) includes initiated and honorary members of Phi Beta Sigma (\u03a6\u0392\u03a3). Members traditionally are initiated into a chapter, although some members are granted honorary membership status. A chapter name ending in Sigma denotes a graduate chapter. No chapter of Phi Beta Sigma is designated Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet that traditionally signifies the end; deceased brothers are referred to as having joined The Omega Chapter. The fraternity has been led by 33 international presidents. Its membership includes four African presidents; two governors; three congressmen; the first black Rhodes Scholar; numerous NFL football, NBA basketball, and MLB baseball players; an ultimate fighter; five Hall of Fame athletes; ten college and university presidents; and sixteen Olympians. Various buildings and schools have been named after Sigma men such as George Washington Carver, James Weldon Johnson, and Robert Russa Moton. Listed below are notable Phi Beta Sigma men such as the founders, international presidents, and members who are involved in the fields of arts and entertainment, business, civil rights, education, health, law, politics, science, and sports."
