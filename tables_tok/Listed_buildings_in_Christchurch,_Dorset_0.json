        "Christchurch town centre and the Harbour are overlooked by the 11th-century Christchurch Priory . Once a monastery , it was given to the town for use as a parish church by Henry VIII after the dissolution in 1540 . It is the longest parish church in England with a nave over 311 feet long . The nave and transepts are Norman with heavy columns and round arches , whereas the lady chapel is from the 14th century and more 'Perpendicular ' in style . The great choir is even later , having been rebuilt in the 16th century . The Priory is famous for its Miraculous Beam , which attracts pilgrims from all over the world . DoE Reference : 748/1/14",

        "The castle ruins are of a motte and bailey construction and are of Norman origin or possibly even Saxon . It has been suggested that there may have been a castle on this spot as early as 924 AD when ; after Aethelwold captured the town ramparts in 901 AD , Edward the Elder decided to fortify the town further with a wooden fort on a motte . After the Norman conquest ( 1066 ) the castle 's defences were again strengthened with the addition of a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade . The wooden fort was replaced ; at first with another wooden structure and then in 1300 , with a stone keep . Today the bailey is home to a bowling green and gardens , and the ditch has been filled but parts of the keep and the constable 's house still stand . DoE Reference : 1A/17",

Much of the stonework survives , including a rare example of a Norman Chimney ( one of only five in the country ) . The ground floor which has four slit windows was used as a storeroom . The upper floor accessed by steps outside and an internal staircase contained the main hall . As well as the chimney , another notable feature is the privy which extends out over the mill stream .

  "intro": "Christchurch is a borough and town in the county of Dorset on the English Channel coast, adjoining Bournemouth in the west, with the New Forest to the east. Historically in Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974 and is the most easterly borough in the county. Its close proximity to the Cotentin Peninsula made it an important trading port and a potential target for invasion during the Napoleonic and Second World Wars. :88-94\n The borough has over 300 nationally listed buildings and structures, a sample of which are described below, and more than 200 locally listed. :13\n In England, a building or structure is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status: Grade I, defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II*, particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, used for buildings of special interest. Christchurch has seven structures of Grade I status, 12 listed at Grade II* and 316 of Grade II status. Three of the Grade I structures are bridges, one a church, one a Gothic mansion, one a Norman dwelling and one a Norman castle. :1-5 Other structures given recognition by English Heritage include a Victorian pillar box, a 1935 telephone kiosk, a bandstand, a mausoleum (see below), a drinking fountain (see below), two entire graveyards, and two war memorials. In addition the borough has 12 scheduled ancient monuments, three nationally important archaeological sites, 12 conservation areas and four sites of special scientific interest (SSSI). :13 For more information on these, see the main articles Christchurch, Dorset, Stanpit Marsh and Christchurch Harbour."
