        "The whereabouts and even the existence of the CVR and/or FDR has been disputed . Multiple independent investigations have been unable to determine the location of any flight recorders the aircraft may have carried . A proper examination of the crash site was not conducted until 15 years after the shootdown , by which time a majority of the wreckage had been displaced or scavenged . The manufacturer performed maintenance on the airplane a year before the crash , during which they documented that no recorders were installed ( though mounting racks were in place for the operator to install them if they later decided to ) . Rwandan aviation laws at the time required all airplanes used for transporting the head of state to carry both a CVR and an FDR . The possibility that recorders were installed at some point between the work performed by Dassault and the shootdown has not been ruled out",

The greatest depth from which a flight recorder has been recovered is 16,000 feet ( 4,900 m ) , for the CVR of South African Airways Flight 295 . Most flight recorders are equipped with underwater locator beacons to assist searchers in recovering them from offshore crash sites , however these beacons run off a battery and eventually stop transmitting . For various reasons , a flight recorder can not always be recovered , and many recorders that are recovered are too damaged to provide any data",
