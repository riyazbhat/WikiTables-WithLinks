According to the communiqu\u00e9 , dated 17 July 2007 both parties decided to raise their diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level . 20 July was published Chadian objection to ignore protocol in Alwihda article where was written about Prime Minister signature of relations agreement . On the same place of Governmental web was published full text of comminiqu\u00e9 from 17 July 2007 . It shows that Chadian objection to Alwihda article was mistakenly interpreted as a denial of diplomatic relations as such .

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is the government in exile claiming sovereignty of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara. The Polisario Front, the national liberation movement that administers the SADR, currently controls the area that it calls the Liberated Territories, a strip of Western Sahara territory east of the Moroccan Wall. It also administers the Sahrawi refugee camps at Tindouf, Algeria, where its headquarters are. It has conducted diplomatic relations with states and international organisations since its inception in 1973. In 1966, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 22/29 affirmed for the first time the Sahrawi right on self-determination. In 1979, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 34/37 reaffirmed again the right of the Western Sahara people to self-determination and independence, recognising also the Polisario Front as the representative of the Western Sahara people."
