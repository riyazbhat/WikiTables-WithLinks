  "intro": "The 2013 North American Soccer League season was the 46th season of Division II soccer in the United States and the third season of the revived North American Soccer League. It was contested by eight teams including one from Canada. Expansion club New York Cosmos was added to the NASL during the season. A split season format was used for the first time. Puerto Rico Islanders, originally planned to take part in this season, as they did in first two editions, took the year off, due to planned restructuring. The defending Soccer Bowl champions were the Tampa Bay Rowdies, while the San Antonio Scorpions were the defending North American Supporters' Trophy winners."
