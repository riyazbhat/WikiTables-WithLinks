  "intro": "Impact: One Night Only is a series of professional wrestling events held by Impact Wrestling (formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)). Most events are taped and released later periodically as a three-hour pay-per-view broadcast. The series was launched in April 2013, with new PPVs typically released on the first Friday of every month, except for the months that feature a live pay-per-view event. Promoted as individual specials, the events - unlike the live pay-per-view events - are not connected to the storylines featured on the company's weekly television programming nor to each other, though later events incorporated storylines from their weekly television programming into matches and situations. The concept was announced on January 11, 2013 by Impact President Dixie Carter as a part of a change to their pay-per-view programming. Prior to the change, Impact Wrestling held live pay-per-view events monthly. Since 2018, One Night Only events have been released exclusively on the Global Wrestling Network. In 2019, with the launch of Impact Plus, One Night Only events were succeeded by the Impact Plus Monthly Specials."
