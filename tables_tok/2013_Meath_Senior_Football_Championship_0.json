  "intro": "The 2013 Meath Senior Football Championship is the 121st edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Meath, Ireland, and also the 60th anniversary of the first use of the Keegan Cup, won by Navan O'Mahonys first in 1954. The tournament consists of 18 teams, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. Navan O'Mahonys were the defending champions after they defeated Wolfe Tones in the previous years final, but were knocked out by Summerhill at the quarter-final stage. This was Na Fianna's first year ever in the senior grade after claiming the 2012 Meath Intermediate Football Championship title. Nobber were relegated after 3 years as a senior club. Nobber appealed to the Leinster Council after their match with Oldcastle on the basis that the Meath County Board chose them to play Dunshaughlin first after Nobber drew with Oldcastle, even though the loser of the game was meant to play Dunshaughlin next. When Dunshaughlin defeated Nobber, this left Dunshaughlin safe from relegation with nothing to play for against Oldcastle and hence, were defeated. On 30 September, the Leinster Council rejected Nobber's appeal and they lost their senior status. On 20 October 2013, Summerhill GFC claimed their 7th Senior Championship title, when defeating Na Fianna 1-13 to 1-10 in Pairc Tailteann, Navan. The match was broadcast live on Irish television station TG4. Brian Ennis raised the Keegan Cup for Summerhill while Conor Gillespie claimed the 'Man of the Match' award."
