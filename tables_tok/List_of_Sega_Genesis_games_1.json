  "section_title": "Sega Meganet titles",
  "section_text": "Sega Meganet , also known as the Net Work System , was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan . Utilizing dial-up Internet access , Meganet was Sega 's first online multiplayer gaming service , and functioned on a pay to play basis . The system functioned through the use of a peripheral called the Mega Modem and offered several unique titles that could be downloaded , and a few could be played competitively with friends . In addition , it shared technology and equipment with more serious services such as the Mega Anser , used for banking purposes . Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name `` Tele-Genesis '' , it was never released for that region . [ 52 ] The Meganet service utilized its own library of titles , independent of the Mega Drive library . Most of these games never received a cartridge release ; however , Columns , Flicky , Fatal Labyrinth , and Teddy Boy Blues each later saw cartridge versions . Several Meganet games would also later appear in the Game no Kanzume series , released for the Mega-CD exclusively in Japan . Most games for the service were small , at around 128kB per game , due to the limits of Internet connection speeds at the time . [ 53 ] Downloads were estimated to take about five to eight minutes to complete . [ 52 ] All of the Meganet games were available through the Sega Game Library , accessed through the Meganet modem . Due to issues with long-distance charges through the use of telephone lines , as well as seconds of lag time between commands , only two games featured competitive play : Tel-Tel Stadium and Tel-Tel Mahjong , with the remainder of the games available for single players via download . Due to Sega 's reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America , third-party developers in that region were unwilling to invest in developing games specifically for Meganet . This resulted in a low number of titles created for the service . [ 52 ] The following list contains all of the titles released for the Meganet service . All titles in this list were released in Japan only There were 31 games on the Meganet",
