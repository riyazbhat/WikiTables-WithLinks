  "intro": "The 2011 Los Angeles Galaxy season was the club's 17th year of existence as well as their 16th season in Major League Soccer and their 16th consecutive year in the top-flight of American soccer. The Galaxy entered the season as the defending MLS Supporters' Shield titleholders. Most notably, the Galaxy became the third straight team to win consecutive Supporters' Shields, after D.C. United (2006-07) and Columbus Crew (2008-09). The Galaxy clinched their fourth Shield on October 8, after Seattle Sounders FC lost 0-2 at home to Philadelphia Union. They also won their third MLS Cup, defeating Houston Dynamo 1-0 in the final. Outside of league play, the Galaxy participated in the CONCACAF Champions League and the U.S. Open Cup, reaching the Quarterfinals in both competitions. Along with these competitive tournaments, the Galaxy played in the friendly-match World Football Challenge, losing to Real Madrid and drawing to Manchester City. Their record in all competitions (yet excluding their Asia-Pacific tour) was 28-9-11, earning 95/144 points from 48 matches."
