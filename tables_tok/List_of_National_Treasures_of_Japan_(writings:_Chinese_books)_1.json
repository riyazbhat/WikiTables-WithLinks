  "section_text": "In Japan , until the Heian period , the language of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees , codes , commands , communications and certificates . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Consequently , Chinese books were essential for the education of the ( male ) aristocracy , and beginning readers studied books such as the Mencius or the Thousand Character Classic . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Towards the end of the 7th century , to prepare selected sons of the nobility for a government career , Emperor Tenji established the Daigaku-ry\u014d ( `` Academy '' ) . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] At first the curriculum consisted mainly of Confucian Classics and Chinese history . [ nb 9 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century , and the Academy 's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan , Records of the Grand Historian and the Books of Han and Later Han . [ 37 ] [ 39 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Unlike in China at the time , Classical Confucian studies , especially the historical and political side of Confucianism , were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty . [ 46 ] In fact , one of the Japanese emperor 's prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics , histories , and poetic anthologies . [ 47 ] Chinese books had reached Japan since circa 400 AD and had been imported in large quantities through a number of missions during the Sui and Tang Dynasties . Official missions ended after 894 , but books continued to reach Japan in the mid to late Heian period through commercial exchange or via priests travelling to China . [ 48 ] Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries , but unlike sutra copying little is known about the actual copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan . [ 49 ] The Japanese aristocracy and clergy sponsored the transcription of religious and government texts on a large scale by the Nara period . [ 50 ] The first state library was the Zusho-ry\u014d ( `` Bureau of Archives '' ) established by the Taih\u014d Code from 701 . [ nb 10 ] [ 51 ] Attached to the Daigaku-ry\u014d , it oversaw the custody ( collection and preservation ) and transmission of Buddhist and Confucian books from the Nara period , until its destruction by fire in the mid-Heian period ( 11th century ) . [ 8 ] [ 42 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Collection depended largely on the copying of texts held elsewhere . [ 49 ] [ 51 ] In addition to the Zusho-ry\u014d , books were also copied at imperial palace libraries , private libraries of aristocrats , temple libraries and at libraries of organs of the state . [ 42 ] [ 51 ] [ 53 ] In the Heian period , the majority of works held in libraries ( both those produced in China and those copied in Japan ) consisted of Chinese works and scholarly collections were dominated by Chinese secular works . [ 54 ] At the end of the Heian period , the great fire of Kyoto in 1177 , and the burning of temples by the Taira in 1180 , destroyed a large part of the literary heritage . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] During the Kamakura period , the warrior class founded new libraries such as the Kanazawa Bunko . [ 56 ]",
