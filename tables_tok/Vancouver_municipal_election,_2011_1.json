  "intro": "The City of Vancouver held a municipal election on November 19, 2011, along with other municipalities and regional districts in British Columbia. All local government elections were for a three-year period. The ballot elected one mayor, 10 councillors, nine school board trustees and seven park board commissioners. A $180 million capital borrowing plan was also put to a vote. Incumbent Mayor Gregor Robertson and the Vision Vancouver Party sought and won their second term in office following their victory in the 2008 election. All Vision Vancouver candidates won seats in their respective categories. Suzanne Anton lost her bid as mayor but the NPA team gained seats in council, Park Board and School Board. COPE was nearly wiped out this election, losing both seats in city council. Its only elected official was School Board trustee incumbent Allan Wong. On December 8, 2013, Wong resigned from the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) and joined Vision as a sitting trustee. The Green Party of Vancouver had its first elected city councillor with Adriane Carr, but lost its incumbent seat in the Park Board. New party Neighbourhoods for a Sustainable Vancouver (NSV) did not win any seats in council."
