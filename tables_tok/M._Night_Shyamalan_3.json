  "intro": "Manoj Nelliyattu M. Night Shyamalan (/\u02c8\u0283\u0251\u02d0m\u0259l\u0251\u02d0n/ SHAH-m\u0259-lahn; born August 6, 1970) is an Indian-American filmmaker and actor. He is known for making films with contemporary supernatural plots and twist endings. He was born in Mah\u00e9, Pondicherry, India, and raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. The cumulative gross of his films exceeds $3 billion globally. He made his directorial debut in 1992 with his first movie Praying with Anger. His second movie was the comedy-drama film Wide Awake (1998). His most well-received films include the supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense (1999), the superhero thriller Unbreakable (2000), the science fiction thriller Signs (2002) and the period-piece thriller The Village (2004). For The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Afterward, Shyamalan released a series of poorly received but sometimes financially successful movies, including the dark fantasy Lady in the Water (2006), the eco-thriller The Happening (2008), The Last Airbender (2010) (an adaptation of the animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender), and the science fiction film After Earth (2013). Following the financial failure of After Earth, Shyamalan's career was revived with the release of the found footage horror film The Visit (2015), the psychological thriller Split (2016), and continued with the superhero thriller Glass (2019), with these three made for a combined total of $34 million, while earning a combined box office of $625 million. Glass is the third and final chapter of his Unbreakable film series. In addition to his directorial work, Shyamalan was a producer for the horror film Devil (2010)."
