  "intro": "In July 2012 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held three CMLL Super Viernes shows, all of which took place in Arena M\u00e9xico on Friday nights. A Super Viernes was scheduled for Friday July 27, 2012 but had to be canceled due to demonstrations Yo Soy 132 in the neighborhood of Arena M\u00e9xico. Some of the matches from Super Viernes were taped for CMLL's weekly shows that aired in Mexico the week following the Super Viernes show. The shows featured various professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, the bad guys) or faces (technicos in Mexico, the good guys) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public."
