Richard Rhodes reviewed the novel in the New York Times as , Bitter reality ... it all might have happened ... the terrible thing is that it ever had to . The Chicago Sun-Times called it , A magnificent blockbuster of a book . If you can find the time to read only one book this year , let The Traitors be that book . David Schoenbrun of CBS said , It captures the tragedy and comedy , in the classic sense , of that absurd aberration of American history . Shirley K. Sullivan of KTIB Radio called it , Unsettling , haunting ... a proper shocker , and the Saturday Review of Literature urged , Read it for his explosive accounts of jungle warfare and his moral passion . Described by Peter S. Prescott as a sermon masquerading as a novel . UK edition ( 1971 ) titled How Sleep the Brave",
