Two songs were originally written in the 1970s , but were covered by bands in the 1980s . These songs are `` Radar Love '' by Golden Earring , but covered by White Lion and `` Ballroom Blitz '' by Sweet and covered by Krokus . The song list includes tracks such as `` Round and Round '' by Ratt , `` Metal Health '' by Quiet Riot , `` Holy Diver '' by Dio , `` Heat of the Moment '' by Asia and `` Nothin ' But a Good Time '' by Poison . Five of the songs are master tracks : `` Because It 's Midnite '' , `` I Ran ( So Far Away ) '' by A Flock of Seagulls , Scandal 's `` The Warrior '' , Twisted Sister 's `` I Wan na Rock '' , and Judas Priest 's `` Electric Eye '' , while the rest are covers The final setlist was revealed by GameSpy on June 28 , 2007 as listed here . [ 13 ] Unlike previous Guitar Hero games , there are no bonus tracks in Guitar Hero Encore : Rocks the 80s . [ 14 ] Bow Wow Wow 's `` I Want Candy '' was originally announced for the game and appeared in many preview builds . [ 11 ] [ 15 ] However , RedOctane announced that it would no longer appear in the final version . No official comment in regards to the song 's removal has been given . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]",
