  "section_title": "New towns",
  "section_text": "New town is a former urban municipal status in Alberta that is no longer in use . The authority to incorporate a community as a new town came from The New Towns Act , which was chapter 39 of the Statutes of Alberta , 1956 At least 12 communities incorporated as a new town between 1956 and 1967 . Cynthia and Drayton Valley were the first communities in Alberta to incorporate as new towns on June 1 , 1956 . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Drayton Valley did so after only six months of incorporation as a village , [ 22 ] and was also the community that operated under new town status for the shortest period \u2013 eight months from June 1 , 1956 to February 1 , 1957 . [ 23 ] The last community to incorporate as a new town was Fox Creek on July 19 , 1967 . [ 24 ] Fox Creek was previously unincorporated prior to this date . It remained a new town for just over sixteen years until September 1 , 1983 when it changed to town status . [ 25 ] Rainbow Lake was the last community to be recognized as a new town . Its status was changed to that of a town in 1994 when numerous former acts under the authority of Alberta Municipal Affairs were transitioned into the current Municipal Government Act . [ 26 ] Rainbow Lake was also the community that operated under new town status for the longest period \u2013 nearly 28 years from September 1 , 1966 to May 2 , 1994 Other communities that applied for new town status included Slave Lake and Smith . Slave Lake applied , despite already being incorporated , to access additional provincial funding but the application was denied by the provincial cabinet . In the case of Smith , after applying in 1968 , its application was denied after the province 's feasibility study for the community determined Smith was unlikely to attract further economic development .
