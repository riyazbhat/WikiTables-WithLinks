  "intro": "Survivor Series (1995) was the ninth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 19, 1995, at the USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland, and was the first Survivor Series to take place on a Sunday night. Each previous edition had taken place either on Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving Eve; the company would not do another non-weekend pay-per-view event until 2004, when Taboo Tuesday debuted. The main event was a No Disqualification match between Diesel and Bret Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hart won the match and the title by pinfall, becoming a three-time champion and ending Diesel's 358-day reign - the longest of the 1990s. The undercard featured Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog, and Sycho Sid versus Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon, and Dean Douglas in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu, and Henry Godwinn) versus The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Goldust versus Bam Bam Bigelow and Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe, and Lioness Asuka versus Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa, and Chaparita Asari in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match and The BodyDonnas (Skip, Rad Radford, Dr. Tom Prichard and 1-2-3 Kid) versus The Underdogs (Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz and Bob Holly) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match."
