  "section_text": "Map of Sullivan County and vicinity with CR 171 through CR 179A highlighted in red The Roscoe to Bloomingburg series is made up of county routes 171 through 176 , 178 , and 179 , plus three spur routes . All eight mainline routes are mostly continuous and collectively extend from the Delaware County line northwest of Roscoe to the Bloomingburg village line just west of the Orange County line . In between , the route serves Liberty , Monticello , and Wurtsboro via locally maintained highways as the county designations end at the village limits . The series parallels the NY 17 expressway for its entire length and also runs along the southern boundary of Catskill Park from Livingston Manor to the Delaware County line Most of the eight mainline routes and CR 179A were originally designated as part of NY 17 in 1924 . [ 3 ] In the vicinity of Wurtsboro , however , NY 17 initially followed modern CR 166 . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It was realigned between 1935 and 1938 to use what is now CR 172 instead . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Construction began in the early 1950s on a new limited-access alignment for NY 17 through Sullivan County . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Over the next 10 years , NY 17 was realigned to follow the freeway as new sections of it opened up . By 1962 , all of the modern Quickway from Parksville to Bloomingburg was complete and open to traffic . [ 10 ] The highway was extended north to Livingston Manor ( exit 96 ) by 1964 [ 11 ] and completed through Sullivan County by 1968 . [ 12 ] Route list",
