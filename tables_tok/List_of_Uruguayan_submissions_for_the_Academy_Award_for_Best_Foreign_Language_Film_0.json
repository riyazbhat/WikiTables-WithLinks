  "intro": "Uruguay has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] regularly since 2001. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Uruguay, represented by Cinemateca Uruguaya, submitted drama A Place in the World to AMPAS in the fall of 1992. On December 3, 1992, AMPAS included the film on its list of official submissions and it was screened alongside 32 other films for AMPAS' Foreign Language Film Committee. On February 17, 1993, it was announced that the film had been nominated for an Oscar, representing Uruguay. A controversy quickly began when stories began circulating that the film had minimal Uruguayan artistic input- the film was shot by an Argentine writer/director in Argentina, the plot was set in Argentina, and the cast and crew were primarily from Argentina. The film was in the running (and finished in second place) to represent Argentina in the Oscar race, it represented Argentina at the Golden Globe Awards and eventually went on to win Best Picture at the Argentinian National Film Awards (the Asociaci\u00f3n de Cr\u00edticos Cinematogr\u00e1ficos de Argentina) Ultimately, AMPAS disqualified the film and removed it from the Oscar ballot. Uruguay rejoined the Oscar competition in 2001."
