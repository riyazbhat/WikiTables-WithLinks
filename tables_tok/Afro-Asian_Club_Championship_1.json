  "intro": "The Afro-Asian Club Championship, sometimes referred to as the Afro-Asian Cup, was a football competition endorsed by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and Asian Football Confederation (AFC), contested between the winners of the African Champions' Cup and the Asian Club Championship, the two continents' top club competitions. The championship was modelled on the Intercontinental Cup (organised by Europe's UEFA and South America's CONMEBOL football federations and now replaced by the FIFA Club World Cup) and ran from 1987 to 1999."
