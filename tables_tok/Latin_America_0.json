  "intro": "Latin America[a] is a group of countries and dependencies in the Western Hemisphere where Romance languages such as Spanish and Portuguese are predominantly spoken; it is broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic America. The term Latin America was first used in an 1856 conference with the title Initiative of the Americas. Idea for a Federal Congress of the Republics (Iniciativa de la Am\u00e9rica. Idea de un Congreso Federal de las Rep\u00fablicas), by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao. The term was used also by Napoleon III's French government in the 1860s as Am\u00e9rique latine to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (French Canadians, French Louisiana, French Guiana, Haiti, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy), along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed, including the Spanish-speaking portions of the United States (Southwestern United States and Florida) Today, areas of Canada (such as Quebec) and the United States (with the exception of Puerto Rico) where Spanish and French are predominant and are typically not included in definitions of Latin America even if technically speaking they are. Latin America consists of 20 countries and 14 dependent territories that cover an area that stretches from Saint Pierre and Miquelon to Tierra del Fuego and includes much of the Caribbean. It has an area of approximately 19,197,000 km2 (7,412,000 sq mi), almost 13% of the Earth's land surface area. As of 2018, its population was estimated at more than 642 million[b] and in 2019, Latin America had a combined nominal GDP of US$5,188,250 million and a GDP PPP of 10,284,588 million USD."
