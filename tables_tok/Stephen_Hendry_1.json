  "intro": "Stephen Gordon Hendry MBE (born 13 January 1969) is a Scottish former professional snooker player and current commentator for the BBC and ITV. One of the most successful players in the history of snooker, he has won snooker's most prestigious tournament, the World Snooker Championship, a record seven times and holds the record for most seasons as world number one (9). His first world title in 1990, at the age of 21, made him the youngest-ever World Champion, a record that he still holds. Hendry also won six Masters titles (including five consecutively), and five UK Championship titles. His total of 18 Triple Crown tournament wins is surpassed only by O'Sullivan's 19. One of only three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, Hendry is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989/1990 and 1995/1996 seasons. He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Ronnie O'Sullivan. A prolific break builder, he recorded a total of 775 career century breaks, and made 11 officially-recognised maximum breaks in professional competition. He was awarded an MBE in 1994, and voted BBC Scotland's Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and 1996. In May 2012, after featuring in his 27th consecutive World Championship, he announced his retirement from the game, bringing to an end his record 23 consecutive seasons in the top 16 of the world rankings."
