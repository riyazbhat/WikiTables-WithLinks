  "section_title": "Election campaign -- Debates",
  "section_text": "The first broadcast debate of the campaign took place on 28 September 2011 , the day that nominations closed , on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 's News at One programme . This was followed by a series of televised one-on-one interviews with the candidates on RT\u00c9 One 's evening Prime Time programme on the same day . [ 141 ] [ 142 ] A second debate was held on The Late Late Show on 30 September ; David Norris was not interviewed alone as the other six candidates were as he had been interviewed the previous week on the programme , but was included in the later panel debate . [ 143 ] During a debate on Today FM Gay Mitchell controversially spoke of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth , with some other candidates disagreeing with him . [ 140 ] Mitchell suffered from poor voter recognition , [ 149 ] and was criticised over remarks on suicide he made on live radio . [ 150 ] [ 151 ] On 12 October , Miriam O'Callaghan moderated a debate on RT\u00c9 's Prime Time with the seven candidates . [ 152 ] [ 153 ] The debate , lasting 90 minutes , took place on a Wednesday night , though Prime Time usually aired on a Tuesday and Thursday , and was announced a week in advance . [ 154 ] Dana Rosemary Scallon read out a prepared statement towards the end of the debate , announcing that a `` malicious '' and `` false '' accusation has been made against her and her family in the United States and , while refusing to divulge any details , she said she would leave `` no stone unturned '' in her mission to track down the person or organisation responsible . [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Scallon was visibly upset and was comforted by other candidates . [ 157 ] She met with her lawyers the next day . [ 158 ] David Norris expressed sorrow for Scallon and comforted her , also expressing frustration at the general tone of the election campaign and saying the media had libelled him in some of its reports . [ 159 ] Scallon told TV3 News on 14 October that a freelance journalist had told her the allegations would appear through the media . [ 160 ] Miriam O'Callaghan 's treatment of Martin McGuinness resulted in more than 100 complaints to RT\u00c9 . [ 161 ] O'Callaghan 's RT\u00c9 colleague Pat Kenny said he watched on `` with shock and horror because I do n't think I 've ever seen a politician ever interviewed on radio before and more or less called a murderer . That was kind of shocking . `` [ 162 ] McGuinness himself also expressed disappointment with O'Callaghan . [ 163 ] Gallagher 's campaign suffered a severe setback on 24 October when , in the last televised debate before the election , he admitted collecting a \u20ac5,000 cheque from someone he described as a `` convicted criminal and fuel smuggler '' , for a Fianna F\u00e1il fundraiser event which gave access to the then Taoiseach , Brian Cowen after being questioned on the matter by Martin McGuinness . [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Gallagher had been the frontrunner in an opinion poll at this point . [ 166 ] The donation was later revealed to be from businessman Hugh Morgan . Gallagher subsequently denied collecting a cheque from Morgan , but refused to answer questions on an illegal director 's loan of \u20ac82,829 , which had also been raised in the 24 October televised debate . [ 167 ] After this performance Gallagher 's campaign was compared to Devon Loch 's fall at the winning post in the 1956 Grand National . [ 168 ] He was reported to have been left `` shell-shocked '' afterwards . [ 169 ] Gallagher cancelled his planned meet-the-people visits the following day so that he could tour broadcasters and attempt to explain his behaviour . [ 170 ] On 7 March 2012 , the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland ( BAI ) upheld a complaint against RT\u00c9 relating to the broadcasting of the tweet that derailed Gallagher 's presidential campaign . [ 171 ] Eventual winner Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the Fianna F\u00e1il party , and admitted on 13 October that he had been elected chairman of the UCG Fianna F\u00e1il university cumann in 1966 . [ 172 ] While at university in the United States he had , he admitted , smoked marijuana . [ 172 ] However , media reports said he was `` spared the intense grilling Miriam O'Callaghan meted out to some of the others '' during the Prime Time debate . [ 173 ]",

  "intro": "The 2011 Irish presidential election was the thirteenth presidential election to be held in Ireland, and was contested by a record seven candidates. It was held on Thursday, 27 October 2011. The election was held to elect a successor to Mary McAleese, with the winner to be inaugurated as the ninth President of Ireland on 11 November 2011. Two constitutional referendums and a by-election for a vacant D\u00e1il seat in the Dublin West constituency took place on the same day. The seven candidates were Mary Davis, Se\u00e1n Gallagher, Michael D. Higgins, Martin McGuinness, Gay Mitchell, David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon. Higgins was nominated by Labour, McGuinness was nominated by Sinn F\u00e9in and Mitchell was nominated by Fine Gael, while Independent candidates Davis, Gallagher, Norris and Scallon were nominated by local authorities. The previously dominant Fianna F\u00e1il party declined to nominate a candidate following their disastrous general election campaign earlier that year. Michael D. Higgins was ultimately elected as president."
