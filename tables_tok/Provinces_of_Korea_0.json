  "intro": "Korea's provinces (Do; hangul: \ub3c4; hanja: \u9053) have been the primary administrative division of Korea since the mid Goryeo dynasty in the early 11th century, and were preceded by provincial-level divisions (Ju and Mok) dating back to Unified Silla, in the late 7th century. During the Unified Silla Period (AD 668-935), Korea was divided into nine Ju (\uc8fc; \u5dde), an old word for province that was used to name both the kingdom's provinces and its provincial capitals. After Goryeo defeated Silla and Later Baekje in 935 and 936 respectively, the new kingdom was divided into one royal district (Ginae; \uae30\ub0b4; \u757f\u5167) and twelve administrative districts (Mok; \ubaa9; \u7267) (Nahm 1988), which were soon redivided into ten provinces (Do). In 1009 the country was again redivided, this time into one royal district, five provinces (Do) and two frontier districts (Gye; \uacc4; \u754c?). After the Joseon Dynasty's rise to power and the formation of Joseon in 1392, the country was redivided into eight new provinces (Do) in 1413. The provincial boundaries closely reflected major regional and dialect boundaries, and are still often referred to in Korean today simply as the Eight Provinces (Paldo). In 1895, as part of the Gabo Reform, the country was redivided into 23 districts (Bu; \ubd80; \u5e9c), which were replaced a year later by thirteen new provinces. The thirteen provinces of 1896 included three of the original eight provinces, with the five remaining original provinces divided into north and south halves (Bukdo (\ubd81\ub3c4; \u5317\u9053) and Namdo (\ub0a8\ub3c4; \u5357\u9053) respectively). The thirteen provinces remained unchanged throughout the period of Japanese annexation. With the liberation of Korea in 1945, the Korean peninsula was divided into Northern Korea and Southern Korea under trusteeship from Soviet Union and America, with the dividing line established along the 38th parallel. As a result, three provinces - Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon (Kangw\u014fn) - were divided into North Korea and South Korea today. The special cities of Seoul and P'y\u014fngyang were formed in 1946."
