  "intro": "The 2010 Australian Football League season commenced on 25 March 2010 and concluded on 2 October 2010. It was the 114th season of the elite Australian rules football competition and the 21st under the name 'Australian Football League', having switched from 'Victorian Football League' after 1989. The premiership was won by Collingwood, who defeated St Kilda by 56 points in the Grand Final Replay, which was played after the first Grand Final was drawn. Collingwood's win marked the 15th VFL/AFL premiership in the club's history. The 2010 AFL season had a total attendance of 7,146,738 people and an average attendance of 38,423 per game, both of which were the highest in league history (breaking the previous records set in 2008). The record for total attendance was broken in 2017, but the record for average attendance still stands. It was the 16th and final season to be played with sixteen teams. An expansion of the league occurred over the following two seasons, with Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney joining in 2011 and 2012 respectively."
