  "intro": "This is a list of medieval stone churches in Finland. A total number of 104 fieldstone churches were built between the 13th and 16th century, of which 83 have been preserved. Numbers include the sacristies of uncompleted churches as well as three churches in Vyborg which is now part of Russia. The construction years for each church are listed in accordance with the 1994 PhD thesis of historian Markus Hiekkanen, Suomen keskiajan kivikirkot (Finnish medieval stone churches), although since the publication of his thesis it has emerged that some historians disagree with some of the dates he offers. Until Hiekkanen's research, most of the churches were generally considered 100-200 years older. The provinces in this list refer to the historical provinces of Finland which differ from the modern regions of Finland."
