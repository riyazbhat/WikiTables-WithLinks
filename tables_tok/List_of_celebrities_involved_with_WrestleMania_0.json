  "intro": "WrestleMania is a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and is considered the flagship event of the company. The events feature wrestlers from the promotion's roster competing in a variety of professional wrestling matches (with predetermined outcomes, though portrayed as legitimate). The WrestleMania franchise debuted in 1985 with WrestleMania I, and has been produced annually since then. WrestleMania 35 is the most recent production. Aside from professional wrestling performances, celebrities have been a major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves them to attract more hype and media attention for the event, in an effort to boost pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, sports, and modeling, and have been used in a variety of roles, such as live musical performances, backstage segments, ringside managers, and on some occasions even as wrestlers. Overall, there have been 99 celebrities involved at WrestleMania: 31 athletes, 29 musicians, 19 actors, and 20 from various other backgrounds. Nine of these celebrities would subsequently be inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame."
