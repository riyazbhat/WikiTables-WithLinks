A laine was an open field which was divided into strips ( furlongs and paul-pieces ) separated by pathways ; pre-modern Brighton was surrounded by five , including North Laine . The boundaries defined the pattern of development : main roads ( such as Church Street ) follow the old paths , while side streets run at right-angles along the furlongs and paul-pieces .

Pevsner thought that the combination of small flint-walled cottages and a huge Classical / Italianate brewery building of 1881 made it a bizarre landscape . Extensive parkland , nearby woodland , extensive flint walling and some large 19th-century detached houses contribute to the area 's character . Many buildings are listed",

  "intro": "As of 2020, there are 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove, a seaside resort on the English Channel coast in southeast England. The definition of a conservation area is a principally urban area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Such areas are identified according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Brighton and Hove City Council is responsible for creating conservation areas within the city, and expands upon the statutory definition by stating that each area has high townscape quality [and] its own distinctive character [. which] creates a sense of place. The city has existed in its present form only since 2000, when Queen Elizabeth II granted city status to the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, which was in turn created in 1997 by the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove Borough Councils. Before 1997, the two councils were separately responsible for creating and administering conservation areas. Hove Borough Council designated the first two, in 1969: Charles Busby's expansive self-contained Brunswick Town estate, with a twin-terrace centrepiece as grand as anything in St Petersburg, and the rapidly developed mid-19th-century suburb of Cliftonville, characterised by Italianate villas and large Tudorbethan houses. The following year, Brighton Borough Council set up conservation areas to preserve and improve the historic centres of five ancient downland villages - Ovingdean, Patcham, Preston, Rottingdean and Stanmer - which became part of the urban area in 1928 and 1952 because of boundary changes. Brighton's own architectural set-piece, Thomas Read Kemp's striking, [.] graceful and imposing Kemp Town estate of the mid-1820s, by Busby and Amon Wilds, was designated at the same time. Many more parts of the urban area have been included in conservation areas in subsequent years, either through the creation of new areas or by means of extensions to existing areas."
