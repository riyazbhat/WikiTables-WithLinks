  "intro": "This is a list of all clubs that have taken part in the German football championship from 1903 to 1963, in the era when the national championship was decided by a finals round with a national title game at the end. The German football championship was first held in 1903 and won by VfB Leipzig. In 1904, the championship was not completed due to a protest by Karlsruher FV about a technicality, with all games but the final played. The competition was held again in 1905 and, from then on, annually. The championship was interrupted by the World War I, and not held from 1915 to 1920, when football returned to more organised fashion after the disruptions caused by the war. In 1922, the final was inconclusive and Hamburger SV was declared champions but declined the honor. After this, a championship was held every season until 1944. With the expansion of Nazi Germany, clubs from occupied territories or annexed countries took part in the competition, including teams from Austria, France, Luxembourg, Poland, and Czechoslovakia."
