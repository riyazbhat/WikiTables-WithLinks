  "intro": "Valuair (Chinese: \u60e0\u65c5\u822a\u7a7a) was a Singapore-based low-cost carrier. It was launched on 5 May 2004, offering initial services to Bangkok and Hong Kong. It differentiated itself from other low-cost carriers by offering frills such as a baggage allowance of over 20 kg, in-flight food, allocated seats, and 32 inch seat pitch. Acquired on 24 July 2005 by Jetstar Asia Airways, the Valuair brand was retained for Jetstar Asia's scheduled services to major cities in Indonesia until 26 October 2014. The Southwest Finger of Level 3 of Terminal 1 at Singapore Changi Airport housed the head office of the airline."
