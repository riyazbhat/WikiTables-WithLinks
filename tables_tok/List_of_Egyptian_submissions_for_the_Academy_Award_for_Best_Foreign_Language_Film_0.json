  "intro": "Egypt has submitted films for consideration for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1958, when Youssef Chahine's Cairo Station became both the first African and the first Arab film to contend for the award. The Foreign Film award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The award was created for the 1956 Academy Awards, succeeding the non-competitive Honorary Academy Awards which were presented between 1947 and 1955 to the best foreign language films released in the United States. Egypt has submitted thirty-four films to the Foreign Oscar competition but has never yet achieved a coveted Oscar nomination. They virtually disappeared from the competition during the sixteen-year period between 1982-2001 (sending a total of three films), but returned as a regular participant in 1999. Youssef Chahine represented Egypt four times, more than any other director."
