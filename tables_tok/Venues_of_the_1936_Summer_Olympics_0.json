  "section_text": "Twenty-two venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics . Many were located in the Reich Sportsfeld complex . Sailing was held in the Bay of Kiel , which would serve as the sailing venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich . [ 23 ] The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two FIFA World Cups and then host an IAAF World Championships in Athletics along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium . Avus Motor Road ( AVUS ) was started in 1907 , but was not completed until 1921 due to World War I . [ 24 ] The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games . [ 24 ] AVUS continued being used after World War II though mainly in Formula 2 racing . [ 24 ] The German Grand Prix was last held at the track in 1959 . [ 24 ] Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998 . [ 24 ] BSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football , handball , athletics , and tennis . [ 25 ] The Reich Sports Field , which consisted of the Olympic Stadium , the Dietrich Ecekrt Open-Air Theatre , the Olympic Swimming Stadium , Mayfield , the Hockey Stadiums , the Tennis Courts , and the Haus des Deutschen Sports , was planned for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics , but was not completed until 1934 . [ 26 ] Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936 . [ 26 ] Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935 . [ 27 ] Mommenstadion opened in 1930 . [ 28 ] Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the International Basketball Federation ( FIBA ) . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The tennis courts were used , which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final . [ 29 ] The K-1 1000 m canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Gr\u00fcnau that included thunder and lightning . [ 31 ] During World War II , Deutschlandhalle suffered heavy aerial bombing damage . [ 27 ] After the second world war , the hall was reconstructed and expansion has continued as of 2010 [ update ] . [ 27 ] The Deutschlandhalle in Berlin , where the boxing , weightlifting , and wrestling events took place , was used as venue , but was increasingly closed for repairs , last in 2009 when it was close for repairs , It was demolished in December 2011. the Mommsenstadion was renovated in 1987 and was still in use in 2010 . [ 28 ] The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germany 's favor . [ 32 ] The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s . [ 33 ] As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands . [ 34 ] British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994 . [ 35 ] Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000 . [ 36 ] This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004 . [ 37 ] The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004 , [ 38 ] with a capacity of 74,228 people . The seating has been changed greatly , especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders . The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC ( 1963\u2013present ) , and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come . For the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France . [ 39 ] Three years later , the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships . [ 40 ]",

  "intro": "The 1936 Summer Olympics (German: Olympische Sommerspiele 1936), officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in 1936 in Berlin, Nazi Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona, Spain, on 26 April 1931, at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona. It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games. To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932, Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built, as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be televised, and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million. Her film, titled Olympia, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports. Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism, and the official Nazi party paper, the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter, wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games. German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods, although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club, Hakoah Vienna, did take part. Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime. Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark, generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133. The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin (which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million \u211b\u2133) or outlays of the German national government (which did not make its costs public, but is estimated to have spent US$30 million)."
