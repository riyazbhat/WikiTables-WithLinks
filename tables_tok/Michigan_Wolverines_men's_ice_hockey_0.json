  "intro": "The Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Earning varsity status in 1922, the program has competed in 97 seasons. Between 1959 and 1981, the team competed in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) before joining the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) until the 2012-13 season. Since the 2013-14 season, the Wolverines have competed in the Big Ten, which began sponsoring hockey. From 1991-2012, the team played in 22 consecutive NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournaments; an NCAA record. The Wolverines have won an NCAA-record nine Division I NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championships, seven of which came during a 17-year stretch between 1948 and 1964. Two more championships were won under head coach Red Berenson in 1996 and 1998. Michigan has had many successes as a program including a record-setting number of championships, total championship tournament appearances, and consecutive tournament appearances. In 2010, Michigan hosted a Guinness verified world record crowd in excess of 113,000 in an event known as The Big Chill. Players from the program have earned numerous honors, professional championships, international championships, individual statistical championships, team and individual records. The team is currently led by Mel Pearson, a former assistant to coach Red Berenson who retired in 2017 after leading the program for 33 years. Berenson for nearly fifty years has continued to hold the school single-season goal scoring record, and was the second player in the program's history to win the Stanley Cup."
