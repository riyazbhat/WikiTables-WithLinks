  "intro": "The first world record in the men's javelin throw was recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1912. As of June 21, 2009, 46 world records have been ratified by the IAAF in the event. New specifications for the javelin were introduced in 1986, and javelins with serrated tails were banned in 1991 which had the effect of reverting to an earlier record set in 1990."
