Band Aid 's 1984 song `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ? '' is the second best selling single in UK Chart history . The 1987 single `` Fairytale of New York '' by The Pogues , a rock band from London , is regularly voted the British public 's favourite ever Christmas song , and it is also the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] British glam rock bands had major hit singles with Christmas songs in the 1970s ; `` Merry Xmas Everybody '' by Slade , `` I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday '' by Wizzard and `` Lonely This Christmas '' by Mud , all of which have remained hugely popular .

  "intro": "Christmas music comprises a variety of genres of music on a variety of topics, religious and otherwise, regularly performed or heard around the Christmas season. Christmas carols remain a large part of the popular Christmas song canon, with numerous titles being added in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s in the United States. Subject matter ranges from the nativity of Jesus Christ, to gift-giving and merrymaking, to mythical figures surrounding the holidays such as Santa Claus and his elves. Many songs simply have a winter or seasonal theme, or have been adopted into the canon for other reasons. The Great Depression era of the 1930s brought a stream of songs of American origin, most of which did not explicitly reference the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more secular traditional Western themes and customs associated with Christmas. These included songs aimed at children such as Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and White Christmas, the latter of which remains the best-selling single of all time as of 2018. Performances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings is an integral staple of the Christmas holiday in many cultures across the world. Radio stations often convert to a 24-7 Christmas music format leading up to or during the holidays, starting sometimes before Thanksgiving in the United States - as part of a phenomenon known as Christmas creep."
