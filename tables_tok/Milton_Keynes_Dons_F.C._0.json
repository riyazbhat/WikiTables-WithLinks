  "intro": "Milton Keynes Dons Football Club (/\u02ccm\u026alt\u0259n \u02c8ki\u02d0nz \u02c8d\u0252nz/), usually abbreviated to MK Dons, is a professional association football club based in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The team competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, after gaining promotion at the end of the 2018-19 season. The club was founded in 2004, following Wimbledon F.C. 's controversial relocation to Milton Keynes from south London, when it adopted its present name, badge and home colours. [n 2]\n Initially based at the National Hockey Stadium, the club competed as Milton Keynes Dons from the start of the 2004-05 season. After two seasons in League One, they were relegated to League Two in 2006. The club moved to their current ground, Stadium MK, for the 2007-08 season, in which they won the League Two title and the Football League Trophy under the management of Paul Ince. After seven further seasons in League One, the club won promotion to the Championship in 2015 under the management of Karl Robinson; however, they were relegated back to League One after one season. Milton Keynes Dons have built a reputation for youth development, run 16 disability teams and their football trust engages around 60,000 people; between 2012 and 2013 the club produced 11 young players who have been called into age group national teams and between 2004 and 2014 the club gave first-team debuts to 14 local academy graduates, including the England international midfielder Dele Alli. The club also run a women's association football side, Milton Keynes Dons Women."
