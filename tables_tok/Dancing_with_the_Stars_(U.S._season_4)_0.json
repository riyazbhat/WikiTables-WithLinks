  "intro": "Season four of Dancing with the Stars premiered on March 19, 2007, on the ABC network. To avoid direct competition with Fox's American Idol, Dancing with the Stars changed time slots from the previous season. In this season, the performance show aired on Mondays, and the results show aired on Tuesdays. No elimination was scheduled for the first week, in order to allow viewers two weeks to see all of the couples perform both Latin and Standard ballroom dances. This season was broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on Sunday afternoons from Sunday, July 15, 2007. On May 22, 2007, olympic short-track speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno and Julianne Hough were announced the winners, marking the first win for Hough."
