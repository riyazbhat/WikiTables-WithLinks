  "intro": "NJ Transit Rail Operations (NJTR) provides passenger service on 12 lines at a total of 166 stations, some operated in conjunction with Amtrak and Metro-North (MNR). NJTR was established by NJ Transit (NJT) to run commuter rail operations in New Jersey. In January 1983 it took over operation from Conrail (CR), which itself had been formed in 1976 through the merger of a number of financially troubled railroads and had been operating commuter railroad service under contract from the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Soon after it was created, NJT commissioned a survey of operating stations, 53 of which were eventually nominated and listed on the state and federal registers of historic places in 1984. Since 2009, NJT is a stakeholder in the state's smart growth transit-oriented development (TOD) initiatives, its transit hubs forming the basis for transit villages. The regional rail network, which serves the northern and central parts of New Jersey and Rockland and Orange counties in New York, radiates from Hoboken, Midtown Manhattan, and Newark. Lines intersect at Secaucus Junction. Service from Atlantic City and south from Trenton, is provided by one NJTR and two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) regional rail lines to Center City, Philadelphia. Amtrak provides service in New Jersey along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Newark and Trenton and at intermediate points. Since its inception, NJT has closed several stations and opened new ones reflecting infrastructure improvements and discontinuance or additions in service. Some station locations, not listed here, became part of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) and the River Line, which were largely built along existing railroad rights-of-way. New and re-opened stations are being built or proposed along planned expansions and extensions, notably the Lackawanna Cut-Off, which is under reconstruction."
