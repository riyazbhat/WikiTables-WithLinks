  "section_text": "A Class 153 at Trimley in 2012 The first diesel multiple unit ( DMU ) to be tested on the branch visited on 16 November 1955 but it was decided that the steam-hauled trains could handle the traffic volumes better , although eight-car DMUs did work excursion trains from the London Midland Region to Felixstowe the following year . The branch passenger service was eventually converted to DMU operation on 5 January 1959 . [ 15 ] The first DMUs at Felixstowe were lightweight types built by Metropolitan Cammell and British Railways ' Derby Works . [ 15 ] These were soon replaced by heavier types from Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon ( later Class 100 ) , [ 53 ] Metropolitan Cammell ( Class 101 ) , Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon ( Class 104 and Cravens ( Class 105 ) . [ 54 ] In the 1980s these were replaced by new 'Sprinter ' types , initially two-car Class 150/2s and Class 156s . Since a more frequent timetable has been possible following the 1997 resignalling most trains are one-car Class 153s , although Class 170 'Turbostars ' are occasionally seen . [ 55 ] Class 37s pass through Trimley in 1991 A Class 70 near North Terminal in 2012 The first diesel locomotive believed to have visited Felixstowe was Brush Type 2 D5503 which brought an excursion train from London Liverpool Street on 12 April 1959",
