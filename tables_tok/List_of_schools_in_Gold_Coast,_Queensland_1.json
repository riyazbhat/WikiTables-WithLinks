  "intro": "This is a list of schools in the Gold Coast region of Queensland, Australia. Prior to 2015, the Queensland education system consisted of primary schools, which accommodated students from kindergarten to Year 7 (ages 5-13), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 8 to 12 (ages 12-18). However, from 2015, Year 7 became the first year of high school."
