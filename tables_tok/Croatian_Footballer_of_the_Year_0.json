  "intro": "The Croatian Footballer of the Year (Croatian: Nogometa\u0161 godine) is the most prestigious annual association football award in Croatia. It is awarded by the newspaper Ve\u010dernji list to the best Croatian football player in the preceding year, regardless of the league they play in, based on a points system which measures their performances for both club and country. The award is usually presented in a ceremony hosted by the Croatian Football Federation. The award was established in 1972 and, until 1990, the award was given to the best Yugoslav player in the preceding year. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the award is given to the best Croatian player. Luka Modri\u0107 holds the record for most wins, with seven awards. Davor \u0160uker is second with six awards. They are followed by Dado Pr\u0161o with three wins from 2003 to 2005. In 1995, a separate award, the Hope of the Year (Croatian: Nada godine), was introduced. It is awarded to the best young Croatian player. As of 2016, only Ivica Oli\u0107 and Luka Modri\u0107 have won both the Hope of the Year and Footballer of the Year awards."
