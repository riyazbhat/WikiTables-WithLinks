  "section_text": "After the election of the Afghan Parliament in 2005 the cabinet picked by Karzai had to be approved , as is required by the Afghan Constitution . At the time the cabinet started in 2004 there was no parliament in session , so the parliamentary approval could only take place after the 2005 elections . Karzai took this opportunity to make some changes in the composition of his cabinet . Some cabinet members got another portfolio , other cabinet members were replaced by new ministers . The most notable change was the replacement of Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah by Rangeen Dadfar Spanta . Abdullah was offered several lesser posts but refused them . [ 11 ] With the resignation of Abdullah Abdullah , the last of the powerful trio of the Shura-e Nazar faction , consisting of Abdullah Abdullah , Yunus Qanuni and Mohammad Fahim left the government , making Ismail Khan the only warlord left in the cabinet Apart from changes in the composition also minor changes in the portfolios of the ministers were made . Karzai created a new position of 'Senior Minister ' for former vice-president Amin Arsala and merged the ministers of information and culture and Youth Affairs to a new minister of Youth and Culture . The Ministry of Disabled and Martyrs was merged with the Ministry of Social Affairs . The new Mines minister lost the portfolio of industries , instead Arsala 's successor now became minister of commerce and industries On 22 March 2006 Karzai announced the following changes would be made in the cabinet he would send to the Wolesi Jirga for approval",
