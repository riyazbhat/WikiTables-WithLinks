  "intro": "This is a list of districts of Russia. A district (raion) is an administrative and municipal division of a federal subject of Russia. Within the framework of administrative divisions, the administrative districts are on the same level of hierarchy as the cities of federal subject significance and may be further subdivided into towns of district significance, urban-type settlements of district significance, and selsoviets, although the exact terms for these entities vary from one federal subject to another. Within the framework of municipal divisions, the municipal districts are on the same level of hierarchy as urban okrugs and are further subdivided into urban settlements, rural settlements, or both. Municipal districts are commonly formed within the boundaries of existing administrative districts, although in practice there are some exceptions to this rule. Major Russian cities are divided into city districts. Despite a similarity in terminology, they are divisions of a different kind and are not within the scope of this article. Unlike other federal subjects of Russia, the federal cities have the unique structure of the administrative-territorial divisions. The administrative-territorial divisions of the federal city of Moscow in particular include districts and settlements, which, in turn, are grouped into administrative okrugs. Only the districts are included below. However, as the districts of neither Moscow nor St. Petersburg include any inhabited localities, they do not have administrative centers. The Republic of Crimea is a federal subject of Russia formed on the territory of the Crimean Peninsula, which is disputed between Russia and Ukraine."
