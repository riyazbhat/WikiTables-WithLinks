  "section_text": "The Pond Eddy to Monticello series is made up of CR 41 through CR 45 and CR 47 through CR 49 , including CR 45A . The Pond Eddy\u2013Monticello roadway begins at NY 97 in Pond Eddy and progresses north as CR 41 through CR 45 , from south to north , to a terminus at NY 42 south of Monticello . CR 47 is a spur off CR 32 from Eldred to Highland Lake . The route itself does not connect to any other route in the Pond Eddy-Monticello series ; however , the unnumbered Mohican Lake Road continues east from the eastern terminus of CR 47 to intersect CR 42 near Glen Spey . The remaining routes are spurs off the main Pond Eddy\u2013Monticello route . Route list",

  "intro": "County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route 11 (CR 11); the highest is CR 183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route 17 (NY 17). Sullivan County posted signage of their routes in 1958."
