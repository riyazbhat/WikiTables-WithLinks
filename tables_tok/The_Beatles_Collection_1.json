  "intro": "The Beatles Collection is a box set of the Beatles' vinyl albums released in the United States in November 1978 and the following month in the United Kingdom. It contains the official catalogue of the Beatles in stereo, and a new compilation called Rarities. The American issue by Capitol Records contained the British pressings of the same 12 original albums, with the American pressing of Rarities. The latter differed from its British counterpart in that it included the previously released English-language versions of She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand, rather than the German-language version found on the British Rarities compilation. The American edition of the box set was a limited edition of only 3000 numbered copies. The limited availability of the American release resulted in the British release becoming popular as an import into the US. There is also a rare EMI New Zealand version which combines the British box with some elements of the American version, such as the US custom liner on a gatefold Rarities."
