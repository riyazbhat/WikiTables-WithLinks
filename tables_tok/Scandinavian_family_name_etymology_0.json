  "section_title": "Denmark",
  "section_text": "The most common Danish family name surnames are patronymic and end in -sen ; for example Rasmussen , originally meaning `` son of Rasmus '' ( Rasmus ' son ) . Descendants of Danish or Norwegian immigrants to the United States frequently have similar names ending in the suffix `` -sen '' or have changed the spelling to `` -son '' . Approximately one-third of the Danish population bear one of the ten most common surnames . More than two-thirds have a patronym ending in -sen in their full name . Many of these patronymics are , however , very rare , local or testimony of unusual descent , e.g . Heilesen from Northern Jutland , Holdensen and Boldsen from the former Duchy of Schleswig or Common etymological classes of surnames are occupational ( e.g. , M\u00f8ller - miller , Schmidt - smith , and Fisker - fisher , for example names taken after a village or farmstead inhabited by ancestors . Other higher class people took heritable surnames during the following centuries , clergy often Latinized names ( e.g . Pontoppidan made from Broby ) and artisans often Germanized names . Naming acts applying to all citizens were issued 1771 ( for the Duchy of Schleswig only ) and in 1828 . The rural population only reluctantly gave up the traditional primary patronyms . Several naming acts replaced the first ; in 1856 , 1904 , 1961 , 1981 , 2005 . The result of the first act was that most people took a patronymic surname as their heritable family name , with the overwhelming dominance of a few surnames as a consequence . Later acts have attempted to motivate people to change to surnames that would allow safer identification of individuals . In the table , the top surnames in Denmark are listed as of 1971 [ 2 ] and 2012 . [ 3 ] The general tendency over the past century has been to give up the commonest names and adopt less frequently-used ones .",

  "intro": "Heritable family names were generally adopted rather late within Scandinavia. Nobility were the first to take names that would be passed on from one generation to the next. Later, clergy, artisans and merchants in cities took heritable names. Family names (surnames) were still used together with primary patronyms (father's name plus an affix denoting relationship), which were used by all social classes. This meant that most families until modern times did not have surnames. Scandinavian patronyms were generally derived from the father's given name with the addition of a suffix meaning 'son' or 'daughter' or by occupation like M\u00f8ller - ( Miller ) naming tradition remained commonly used throughout the Scandinavian countries during the time of surname formation. Forms of the patronymic suffixes include: -son, -sen, -fen, -s\u00f8n, -ler, -zen, -zon/zoon, and -ss\u00f8n ."
