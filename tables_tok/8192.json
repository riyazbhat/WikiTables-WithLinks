[ 7 ] The installation shifted about 2m within the base of the 180m high earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906GL reservoir . After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall ( declared safe after lengthy assessment ) , the hydro installation was repaired/replaced but was off-line for several years . A breach of the wall would have obliterated only a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120 km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam , but more significantly , would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the 40m high 3,038GL Lake Hume , 200 km downstream on the Murray River . This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga and a much more intensively settled irrigation area , and consequences would have been disastrous"
