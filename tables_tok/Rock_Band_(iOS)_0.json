  "intro": "Rock Band is a music video game released for the iOS. It was co-developed by EA Montreal and Harmonix, and was published by Electronic Arts and MTV Games. The game was released as a part of the Rock Band series for download through the App Store in several regions on October 19, 2009. On May 2, 2012 RockBandAide announced that EA intends to discontinue Rock Band with servers being disconnected and support being dropped on May 31, 2012. However, EA stated that the message was sent in error and the app will remain available to those who purchased the app. It was later announced that due to an expiring contract with Harmonix the game would be removed from the App Store. This occurred on July 31, 2012, and the game is now currently unavailable; though users who have previously downloaded the game can continue to play it. Gameplay is similar to other Rock Band series games, but controlled without instrument controllers, and instead with the iOS-device's multi-touch display and built-in accelerometer. The game features multiplayer support over Bluetooth, and online play via Facebook Connect. A total of twenty songs appear in the game, and extra songs are available as purchasable, downloadable content."
