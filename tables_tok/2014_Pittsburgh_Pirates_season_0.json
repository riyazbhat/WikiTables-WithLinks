  "intro": "The 2014 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the franchise's 128th season as a member of the National League, 133rd season overall, and 14th season at PNC Park. The regular season began with a win at home against the Chicago Cubs on March 31 and ended with a loss at Great American Ball Park against the Cincinnati Reds on September 28. The Pirates finished the regular season in second place for the second consecutive year in the National League Central Division with 88 wins and 74 losses. The team clinched their second consecutive playoff berth with a victory on September 23. Also for the second consecutive season, however, the Pirates finished in second in their division behind the defending National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. The team secured one of two NL Wild Card spots, as well as home field advantage for the 2014 National League Wild Card Game. However, they lost the October 1 playoff game to the San Francisco Giants, thus eliminating them from the 2014 postseason. Three members of the 2014 Pirates were selected to represent the National League in the All-Star Game. In addition, two Pirates players were named NL Player of the Month: Andrew McCutchen in June and Josh Harrison in August. During the 2014 season, the franchise season attendance record (2,435,867, set during PNC Park's inaugural 2001 season) was broken on September 21, the final home game of the season and 23rd sellout of the year (tying the franchise sellout record set in 2013). The new record stood at 2,442,564 until being broken in the 2015 season."
