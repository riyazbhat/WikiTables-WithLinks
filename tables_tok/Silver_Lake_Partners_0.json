The shares of founder and CEO Michael Dell and some of its key management are not included in this deal . Microsoft additionally provided $ 2 billion in the form of a loan to assist with the buy-out . If the deal is completed Dell will be de-listed from NASDAQ and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and will again be a fully privately owned company as it was before its first Initial public offering . According to Michael Dell this move will make it easier to work on a long-term growth strategy as the company can make choices that will pay out on the longer term , without the need to address to demands of ( short term ) individual share-holders . The deal was completed on October 30 , 2013 , and at $ 24.4 billion was the largest technology buyout ever , surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $ 17.5 billion . Other smaller investors are MSD Capital , an investment firm to manage the wealth of Michael Dell , Microsoft with a $ 2 billion loan and several debt-facilities from banks like Barclays , Credit Suisse , Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada",

The partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake , which led the deal as well as Bain Capital , the Blackstone Group , Goldman Sachs Capital Partners , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , Providence Equity Partners , and TPG Capital . This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom . Also , at the time of its announcement , SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history , a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor . The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction . The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive . In 2015 the consortium sold Sungard to FIS",
