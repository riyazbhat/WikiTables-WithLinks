  "intro": "This is a list of Power Stations in Pakistan. Pakistan had a total installed power generation capacity of over 34 GW by December 2018. However, de-rated capacity is approximately 31 GW during the year. Under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, with an investment of $25 Billion, the power plants of 12,334 MW capacity would be completed on a priority basis. Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in electricity production of almost 11 GW in last five years bridging much needed gap between supply and demand. Pakistan has an installed electricity generation capacity of 33,836 MW in 2018. Furnace oil (16 percent), hydel (27 percent), Natural gas (12 percent), LNG (26 percent), Coal (9 percent), Renewable (Solar & Wind 5 percent) and nuclear (5 per cent) are the principal sources. In the next 10 years, peak electricity demand is expected to rise by four to five per cent, which is roughly 1,500 MW. Pakistan has a lopsided energy mix, diminishing indigenous fuel reserves, increasing circular debt and transmission hold-ups. Pakistan has almost exhausted its gas reserves. Imported oil's price hikes affect the budget and its constant supply cannot be guaranteed. Pakistan has the potential to meet these energy challenges through hydroelectric power, but there are political and environmental issues in building dams."
