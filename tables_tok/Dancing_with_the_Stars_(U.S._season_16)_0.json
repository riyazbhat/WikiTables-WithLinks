  "intro": "Season sixteen of Dancing with the Stars premiered on March 18, 2013. Tom Bergeron and Brooke Burke Charvet returned as hosts, while Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli returned as judges. The Harold Wheeler orchestra and singers also returned to provide the music throughout the season. Scoring returned to using traditional whole numbers, instead of continuing with the fractional scores introduced for the previous (all-star) season. This is the first season where all finalists did not learn a Latin and a ballroom dance; no finalist learned Tango, Alexandra Raisman did not learn Paso doble, Jacoby Jones did not learn Samba, Kellie Pickler did not learn Salsa, and Zendaya did not learn Rumba. Each of the four finalists also did not dance one of the two new dance styles introduced this season. Raisman and Zendaya did not dance Jazz while Pickler and Jones did not dance Contemporary (although Pickler danced a Contemporary freestyle in the finals and Raisman did an Afro-Jazz routine picked from Twitter). Pickler and her partner Derek Hough won the competition, marking his fourth of six wins and increasing his lead on the show as the professional dancer who has won the most mirror ball trophies."
