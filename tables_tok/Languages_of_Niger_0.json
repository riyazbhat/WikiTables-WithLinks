It is spoken mainly as a second language by people who have received an education ( 20% of Nigeriens are literate in French , and even 47% in cities , growing quickly as literacy improves [ 1 ] ) . Although educated Nigeriens still constitute a relatively small percentage of the population , the French language is the language used by the official administration ( courts , government , etc . ) , the media and the business community . See also : African French Niger has ten official national languages , namely Arabic , Buduma , Fulfulde , Gourmanch\u00e9ma , Hausa , Kanuri , Zarma & Songhai , Tamasheq , Tassawaq , Tebu .

  "intro": "Niger has 11 official languages, with French being the official language and Hausa the most spoken language. Depending on how they are counted, Niger has between 8 and 20 indigenous languages. The discrepancy comes from the fact that several are closely related, and can be grouped together or considered apart."
