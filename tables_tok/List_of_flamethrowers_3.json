        "The Blaster ( AKA the BMW Flamethrower hence the production video ) was a 1998 invention by South African inventor Charl Fourie to provide a defence against carjackings . The invention came at a time when crime rates were rising and armed assault and carjackings became a serious public concern in South Africa . The Blaster was a liquefied petroleum gas flamethrower installed along the sides of the vehicle under the doors . Should a carjacker approach , the driver could raise his hands , faking surrender , then activate a pedal or switch and violent flames would erupt from the sides of the vehicle , neutralizing the assailant . The inventor claims it is unlikely to kill but would definitely blind the assailant",
