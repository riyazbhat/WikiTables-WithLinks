  "intro": "Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is exercised on three levels: federal, states and territories, and local government. There are six states: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous Australian colonies. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive. The state parliaments have plenary legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails. A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the High Court. There are also ten territories, whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation. The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between internal territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and external territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location. Two of the three internal territories - the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the Northern Territory - function almost as states. Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden. Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court."
