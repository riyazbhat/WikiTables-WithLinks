  "section_text": "The game disc features 45 songs chosen from the 12 original UK albums by the Beatles , the US album Magical Mystery Tour , the 2006 remix album Love and several non-album singles . [ 8 ] Though `` Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' and `` With a Little Help From My Friends '' are considered to be two songs , they can only be played back-to-back within the game . All songs except `` The End '' are playable immediately in Quickplay and other multiplayer modes , while in Career mode , players complete through the songs in a loosely historical order ; upon completion of the Career mode , `` The End '' , the mode 's final song , becomes available for all other game modes . Regardless of game mode , each song is played in a specific venue . Most venues are based on a historical progression of famous Beatles ' performances , including their first appearance on American television on The Ed Sullivan Show and their concert at Shea Stadium .
