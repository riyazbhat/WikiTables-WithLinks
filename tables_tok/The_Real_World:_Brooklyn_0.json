He spent a year in Iraq , guarded Saddam Hussein at his trial , and suffered a number of near-death experiences . He suffers from knee problems and posttraumatic stress as a result of his tour of duty . He expresses these experiences through his guitar playing , and in a 300-page single-space typed journal . He is described by The Brooklyn Paper as the fun one in the premiere . His experiences in Iraq made him highly critical of the war 's execution , and hopes a victory for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election will preclude his being recalled to Iraq . He is an aspiring filmmaker who hopes to study at the University of Pittsburgh , and a class clown who plays pranks . He has a girlfriend named Belle . His brother Aaron is a military police officer in the Army Reserves , and they have two cousins in the Army as well . He learns in Episode 11 that he is being recalled to active duty",

  "intro": "The Real World: Brooklyn is the twenty-first season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the fourth season of The Real World to be filmed in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, specifically in New York City after The Real World: Back to New York. The season featured eight people who lived on Pier 41 in Red Hook. Although it is the only season to set in the borough of Brooklyn, it is also the third season to take place in a city that had hosted a previous season, as the show's first and tenth seasons were set in New York in 1992 and 2001. The season was aired as 13 one-hour episodes. MTV announced the location in May 2008. Filming began August 14, 2008, and concluded November 24, 2008. The series premiered January 7, 2009, and garnered an 18% increase in ratings over the previous season with 2.3 million viewers. The premiere was made available on iTunes on January 8. On January 4, MTV aired a special called The Real World: Secrets Revealed that documents the evolution of the series over the years. Prior to the beginning of the season Jon Murray, co-creator of The Real World, and Chairman and President of Bunim-Murray Productions, explained the choice of Brooklyn: The Brooklyn season, like the Hollywood season, will focus on what people loved about 'The Real World' when it launched in 1992 - genuine people, meaningful conflict and powerful stories.We're thrilled that MTV is allowing 'The Real World' turn 21! Cast member Chet Cannon remarked on the city that was his home for three months, Brooklyn is usually spoken of as more a place where you dont want to go - I just dont want to get shot down here."
