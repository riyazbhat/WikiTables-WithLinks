  "intro": "The fifth series of Dancing on Ice aired from 10 January to 28 March 2010 on ITV, with a preview show on 8 January 2010. Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby returned as main presenters, while Karen Barber, Nicky Slater, Jason Gardiner and Robin Cousins returned to the Ice Panel. Emma Bunton joined the panel as a replacement for Ruthie Henshall. Barber acted as head judge for weeks 6 and 7 due to Cousins commentating on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, with Michael Ball and Angela Rippon appearing as guest judges in these weeks. This was the last series to feature Slater as a full-time judge, though he returned as a guest judge for two weeks in the ninth series in 2014. For this series only, a spin-off show aired on Friday evenings on ITV, called Dancing on Ice: Friday. It was presented by Ben Shephard and Coleen Nolan. The series was won by former Emmerdale actress Hayley Tamaddon, with Daniel Whiston as the professional winner. The Bill actor Gary Lucy finished second, with Hollyoaks actor Kieron Richardson third."
