  "intro": "The 2012 European Trophy was the third European Trophy, a European ice hockey tournament held annually. It is also the seventh tournament since its predecessor, the Nordic Trophy, was launched in 2006. The regulation round started on 31 July 2012 with the South Division game between Pir\u00e1ti Chomutov-Slovan Bratislava, and will end on 28 November 2012. The playoffs will be played between 13-16 December 2012 in Vienna and in Bratislava. The preliminary schedule for the regulation round was released on 12 April 2012. In this year's tournament the number of participating teams was increased from 24 to 32. Also, as Red Bull Salzburg no longer hosted the playoffs for the first time in European Trophy history, they weren't guaranteed a playoff spot. Of the 128 regular round games, 20 were played mid-season (i.e. after teams had started their league seasons in their respective countries). Regarding the playoffs, there were only Quarterfinals, Semifinals as well as the Final game, meaning that the losing teams in each round were immediately eliminated from the tournament. On 31 May 2012, Slavia Praha announced that they were pulling out of the tournament. On 18 June it was announced that Pir\u00e1ti Chomutov would take over Slavia Praha's spot in the South Division."
