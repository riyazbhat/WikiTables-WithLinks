  "section_text": "Action Zone opened in 1974 as Lion Country Safari , a 100-acre ( 40 ha ) section of the park featuring a monorail ride that took guests on a safari-style tour through an animal preservation . This was part of a network of other safari-style zoos also called Lion Country Safari . It was later renamed Wild Animal Safari in 1977 . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] In 1983 , the area became known as Wild Animal Habitat and included Adventure Village , a new area within the rebranded section . [ 52 ] Over the years , it featured rides such as Screamin ' Demon ( 1977\u201387 ) , the first steel looping roller coaster to run both forward and backward in the United States , and King Cobra ( 1984\u20132001 ) , a stand-up looping roller coaster that was the first of its kind in the world . [ 31 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Early in its tenure after purchasing Kings Island , Paramount unveiled Top Gun , a suspended roller coaster from Arrow Dynamics , in 1993 . [ 55 ] Located next to the habitat attraction , it was titled after a film of the same name and was the first ride to be added to the park with a Paramount theme . [ 55 ] The following year , the entire area was renamed Adventure Village coinciding with the removal of the animal habitat and monorail ride . [ 31 ] In 1999 , a two-year expansion initiative began with the area 's renaming to Action Zone and the addition of two new attractions \u2013 Drop Zone : Stunt Tower and Face/Off . [ 7 ] [ 31 ] When it debuted , Action Zone resembled a movie stunt set featuring a water tower as the centerpiece . The water tower was originally part of a skit with stunts and special effects that imitated a live movie set with a director and stunt performers . [ 56 ] Son of Beast opened in 2000 , the second year of the area 's two-year expansion . It was the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world and the first of its kind to feature a vertical loop . [ 57 ] As a result of a number of structural issues and two accidents , the ride closed permanently in 2009 and was eventually demolished in 2012 . [ 57 ] Other notable rides include Delirium , which opened in 2003 as the largest Giant Frisbee ride in the world , and Banshee , the world 's longest inverted roller coaster which opened in 2014 at the former location of Son of Beast .
