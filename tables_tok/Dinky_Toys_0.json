  "section_text": "No Dinky Toys models were made between 1941 and 1945 . The French Meccano factory was occupied by the Germans , some of whom worked for M\u00e4rklin , and the British factory was on war work but every Christmas a few models would be sold from pre-war stocks . Thus during and after the war a few 'pre-war ' models survived and were sold in 1945 ( Harvey 1974 , p. 1997\u20131998 ) ( The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia ) . The first new models released after the war were U.S. military jeeps ref.153a in April 1946 in England and ref . 24M in France , it was the first Dinky Toy made at the scale of 1/43 Dinky 0 Series no . 25v Bedford refuse wagon with tipping bed Besides some of the military vehicles offered before and after the war , the first significant releases from Dinky in the late 1940s were the 40 series , which were all British saloons . The first new model car released was an Armstrong Siddeley Coupe ( Smeed 1980 , p. 31 ) . These were the opening chapter of the `` golden age '' of Dinky Toys in the post-war era and represented far greater accuracy and detail than their pre-war relatives . These were very popular and today are often considered by collectors to be the quintessential Dinky Toys models . The 40 series cars were manufactured from better quality alloy , meaning that the survival rate is higher and although originally sold in trade boxes of six , they were renumbered in 1954 and re-coloured in two-tone paintwork in 1956 , the Austin Somerset ref . 40j is probably the first model sold in its own individual yellow box . The first two models in the 40 series were in 1:48 scale , while the others were in 1:45 scale ( Schellekens 2010 ) . The Jowett Javelin saloon is an interesting case as plans were made , but the model was never issued . More recently , Odgi Models have remade the Jowett and a couple other Dinky Toys Models which were planned but never manufactured The series included :",
