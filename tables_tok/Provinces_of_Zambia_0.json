  "intro": "Zambia is divided into 10 provinces for administrative purposes. Each province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There are Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Provinces are further divided into districts and all the district headquarters are the same as the district names. There are nine councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called councilor. Each councilor holds office for five years. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. Zambia has predominantly rural provinces and hence there are only three municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Western Province was the largest in terms of area, having 126,386 square kilometres (48,798 sq mi), while Lusaka was the smallest with 21,896 square kilometres (8,454 sq mi). In terms of population, Lusaka was the most populated and most densely populated with a population of 2,191,225 and density of 100 persons per square kilometre."
