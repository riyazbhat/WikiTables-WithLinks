  "section_text": "The war and subsequent ill-treatment had damaged the track and the facilities . After 20 years , the track was now lined with tall hedges and trees , and thus was later baptized Green Hell . Smaller races resumed in the late forties , but Germans and Germany remained excluded from major sports events until 1951 . The pre-war voiturette rule set for supercharged 1500cc engines ( or 4500cc normal ) had basically been made the Formula One in the 1940s . In 1951 , major international racing returned to the Ring , but even though the Alfas had also about 400 hp , they failed to eclipse the pre-war records set by Lang , who raced again for Mercedes in 1952 and 1954 . Two rule changes brought less powerful machinery , and the Le Mans disaster in 1955 led to the cancellation of many GPs in that year , including the German . By 1956 , the old records were finally beaten . Single seater open wheel Grand Prix cars soon came close to 9 minutes and 150 km/h . Also , sports car events emerged in the 1950s , as did touring car racing in the 1960s . The Ring saw two more years without F1 races , as Berlin 's AVUS had been chosen for 1959 , and in 1960 , the German Grand Prix was run on the S\u00fcdschleife to F2 rules which would become F1 rules in 1961 . After three years of progress , including a revival of the mid-engine layout pioneered by Auto Union , the 9 minutes barrier was easily beaten despite small 1500cc engines with less than 200 hp , similar to the power of cars three decades earlier .

  "intro": "The N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife is a motor racing circuit in Germany. Its over 20.8 km (12.9 mi) long old section dating from 1927, was truncated in 1982 as international championships had started to boycott the track after 1976. The adjacent modern N\u00fcrburgring Grand Prix track was opened in 1984. The two tracks can host events independently, or they can be combined, e. g. for the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring. As a result, lap times have been set in racing events on numerous Nordschleife track variants ranging from less than the shortest 20.832 km (12.9 mi) to the current maximum of nearly 26 km (16.2 mi). An even longer approx. 28 km (17.4 mi) combined track that included the 7.7 km (4.8 mi) S\u00fcdschleife was seldom used for major races since the 1930s. This shorter southern circuit was not modernized in the 1970s and was sacrificed for the 1980s construction of the modern track, as were the old pit facilities, the S\u00fcdkehre (southern turn) and the straight behind the pits which were used in an original Nordschleife lap."
