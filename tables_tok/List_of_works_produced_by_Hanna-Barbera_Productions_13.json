  "intro": "This is a list of animated television series, made-for-television films, direct-to-video films, theatrical short subjects, and feature films produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions (also known as H-B Enterprises, H-B Production Company, and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons). This list does not include the animated theatrical shorts William Hanna and Joseph Barbera produced while employed by MGM. Note that some shows or new spin-offs of shows may be listed twice. Hanna-Barbera won eight Emmy Awards. Warner Bros. Animation absorbed Hanna-Barbera in 2001. For subsequent productions featuring Hanna-Barbera created characters, see Cartoon Network Studios and Warner Bros. Animation."
