  "intro": "India made its Summer Paralympic d\u00e9but at the 1968 Games, competed again in 1972, and then was absent until the 1984 Games. The country has participated in every edition of the Summer Games since then. It has never participated in the Winter Paralympic Games. In 1972 at the Heidelberg Games, Murlikant Petkar swam the 50 meter freestyle in a world record time of 37.331 seconds to give India her first ever Gold. India finished 24th out of the 42 participating nations. In 1984, Joginder Singh Bedi won silver at the Men's Shot Put and followed it up with a pair of bronze winning performances in the Discus and Javelin throws. Another Indian, Bhimrao Kesarkar, won the silver medal in the Javelin. India finished 37th out of the 54 participating nations. After the success of the cooperative effort between the IPC and the IOC, which resulted in the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the IPC determined the need to expand and include representatives from all nations that had disability sports programs. The 1988 Summer Paralympics were the first Paralympics in 24 years that took place in the same city as the Olympic Games. This was the first time the term Paralympic Games came into official use. They also deemed it necessary to include athletes in the decisions of the Paralympic governing body."
