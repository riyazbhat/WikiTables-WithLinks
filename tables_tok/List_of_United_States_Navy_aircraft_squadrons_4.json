  "section_text": "C-40A C-20 C-130 The VR designator was first established in 1942 to designated `` Transport '' or `` Air Transport '' or Fleet Logistic Air '' squadrons . From 1958 to 1976 it designated `` Fleet Tactical Support Squadron '' and from 1976 to the present it designates `` Fleet Logistics Support Squadron '' . Today all Fleet Logistics Support squadrons are U. S. Navy Reserve squadrons Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons operate Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift ( NUFEA ) aircraft on a worldwide basis to provide responsive , flexible , and rapidly deployable air logistics support required to sustain combat operations from the sea . During peacetime , squadrons provide air logistics support for all Navy commands as well as provide continuous quality training for mobilization readiness . Fleet Logistics Support squadrons have no counterpart in the Regular Navy . They represent 100 % of the Navy 's medium and heavy intra-theater airlift , and operate year-round , around the world providing the critical link between deployed seagoing units and air mobility command logistics hubs . VR-1 provides dedicated airlift support to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy , Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps The Headquarters of the Fleet Logistics Support Wing is based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth , TX but the squadrons of the wing are based across the country from the east coast to Hawaii . In addition to the VR squadrons , the Fleet Logistics Support Wing also operates two `` Executive Transport Detachments ( ETDs ) '' based in Hawaii and Sigonella Italy",
