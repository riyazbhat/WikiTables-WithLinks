  "intro": "The 2018-19 FA Women's National League is the 27th season of the competition, and the first since a restructure and rebranding of the top four tiers of English football by The Football Association. Began in 1992, it was previously known as the FA Women's Premier League. It sits at the third and fourth levels of the women's football pyramid, below the FA Women's Championship and above the eight regional football leagues. The league features six regional divisions: the Northern and Southern divisions at level three of the pyramid, and below those Division One North, Division One Midlands, Division One South East, and Division One South West. The league normally consists of 72 teams, divided equally into six divisions of twelve teams. After two resignations from and one late promotion to the FA Women's Championship, and one withdrawal from Division One, the league started the 2018-19 season with 13 teams in the Northern Division but only 11 in Division One Midlands. At the end of the season the champions of the Northern and Southern divisions will both qualify for a Championship Play Off match against each other which will decide the overall National League Champion. Subject to meeting league requirements both teams will be promoted to the FA Women's Championship. As part of the Football Association's restructure, clubs from the FA Women's Super League and FA Women's Championship were able to enter teams into the Reserve Section."
