  "intro": "The Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities or NTU Ranking is a ranking system of world universities by scientific paper volume, impact, and performance output. The ranking was originally published from 2007-2011 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) and has been published since 2012 by the National Taiwan University. It uses bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific paper performance. In addition to the overall ranking, it includes a list of the top universities in six fields and fourteen subjects. The rankings were introduced in 2007. The original ranking methodology favored toward universities with medical schools. In 2008, HEEACT began publishing a Field Based Ranking including six fields: agriculture and environmental sciences (AGE), clinical medicine (MED), engineering, computing, and technology (ENG), life sciences (LIFE), natural sciences (SCI), and social sciences (SOC). In 2010, HEEACT began publishing subject rankings in fields of various field of science and technology. Science fields are divided into physics, chemistry, mathematics, and geosciences. Technology fields are split up into electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering (including energy and fuels), materials science, and civil engineering (including environmental engineering). HEEACT ended the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities Project in 2012. Due to disagreement about ranking results, the Taiwanese education authorities announced that the government would no longer support the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan to do this ranking."
