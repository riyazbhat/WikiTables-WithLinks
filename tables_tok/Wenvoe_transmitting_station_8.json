  "section_text": "Analogue BBC Two Wales on channel 51 closed after 45 years of service , and ITV1 Wales was moved from channel 41 to that channel for what would be its final month of service Multiplex 1 from channel 30 was renamed BBC A and moved to channel 41+ ( which had just been vacated by analogue ITV1 Wales ) . In addition to the power increase to 100 kW ERP , it was reconfigured to 64QAM and 8k carriers , which resulted in a service area similar to the old analogue transmissions but with much more bandwidth available than Multiplex 1 ever had For the duration of the switchover , all the channels carried on Multiplex B were duplicated on this new PSB1 multiplex Channel 30 was re-used for Multiplex C , freeing Multiplex C 's old allocation at channel 43-",
