  "intro": "Martin Baynton (born 13 February 1953) is a British author, illustrator, and TV producer. He is a childrens book writer, he has also written fiction for adults and a selection of his short stories have been anthologised. He is well known for his childrens book Jane and the Dragon (1988), which has since been adapted for television and produced by Weta Workshop. His books have been widely published in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia, and he has illustrated books written by authors such as Russell Hoban and Kenneth Grahame. Born in London, Baynton was educated at Hereford Cathedral Prep School and Ledbury Grammar School, and studied electroencephalography at Great Ormond Street Hospital. In the 1970s, he joined St Bartholomew's Hospital developing biofeedback technology, and as a therapist working for biofeedback pioneer Dr Ann Wooley-Hart. In addition to writing and illustrating children's books, Baynton has been a Producer, writer and director for the stage and TV. In 2002 he teamed up with Richard Taylor of Weta Workshop to create and produce children's television. They created the award-winning Jane and the Dragon (based on Baynton's book series of the same name), and more recently The WotWots (for pre-schoolers). Baynton and Taylor are founding partners and owners of Pukeko Pictures a New Zealand-based IP development company creating children's properties for film and TV. Baynton moved to New Zealand in 1987 with his wife Diane and his children Theo and Terri. His son Theo Baynton who is also a writer and illustrator, was the art director on Jane and the Dragon."
