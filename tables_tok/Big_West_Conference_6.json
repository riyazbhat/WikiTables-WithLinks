  "section_text": "The Big West Conference currently sponsors 18 NCAA sports , with men 's volleyball the newest addition for the 2017\u201318 school year . [ 6 ] [ 15 ] In baseball , Cal State Fullerton has won four College World Series titles with national championships in 1979 , 1984 , 1995 , and 2004 . [ 16 ] In addition , Long Beach State and UC Irvine have made multiple appearances in the College World Series . Fullerton also has a national championship in softball , winning in 1984 . Long Beach State has won three NCAA women 's volleyball titles , as a part of Big West Conference women 's volleyball , with national championships in 1989 , 1993 , and 1998 . Misty May-Treanor led the 49ers to a 36-0 record en route to the program 's most recent title . UC Santa Barbara was the NCAA men 's soccer runner-up in 2004 , losing the national championship match to Indiana on penalty kicks . The Gauchos returned to the College Cup in 2006 and won the national championship . Former Big West members UNLV and Pacific won national championships while part of the conference . The UNLV Runnin ' Rebels men 's basketball team won the 1990 NCAA tournament championship after routing Duke 103-73 in the national title game . UNLV was undefeated during the 1991 NCAA men 's basketball season before falling to Duke in the final four . The Runnin ' Rebels during this era are widely considered one of the best college basketball teams of all time . The Pacific Tigers women 's volleyball team won back-to-back national championships in 1985 and 1986 . The Big West did not sponsor men 's volleyball or men 's water polo , but it was the primary conference affiliation of several schools that compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation for these sports , respectively . In NCAA men 's volleyball , UC Irvine has established itself as one of the nation 's most elite programs , winning four national championships in 2007 , 2009 , 2012 , and 2013 . Long Beach State also won men 's national volleyball titles in 1991 , 2018 and 2019 . In NCAA men 's water polo , UC Irvine won three national championships in 1970 , 1982 , and 1989 . UC Santa Barbara also won a men 's water polo title in 1979 . On May 31 , 2016 , the Big West announced the conference would sponsor men 's volleyball as its 18th sport , with five Big West schools leaving the MPSF to establish the new men 's volleyball league . Men 's volleyball is the third of four sports in which the MPSF has recently seen a mass exodus of teams to join an existing conference in a newly sponsored sport , with men 's soccer , men 's water polo , and women 's lacrosse as the others . The men 's volleyball membership includes core Big West members Cal State Northridge , Long Beach State , Hawaii , UC Irvine , and UC Santa Barbara . UC San Diego joined as an affiliate to bring the league to the NCAA minimum requirement of 6 teams to receive an automatic bid for the NCAA tournament . Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell explained that adding UC San Diego was not an indicator UC San Diego would be added to the Big West Conference as a full member . UC San Diego had recently passed a bill to move all their sports to Division I and is looking for an invite from the Big West Conference . UC San Diego has long competed at the Division I level in men 's volleyball ; the NCAA conducts a single national championship open to all Division I and II members , and scholarship limits in the sport are the same in both divisions . The Big West regular season for men 's volleyball will be double round-robin , each team playing the others once at home and once on the road . The Big West Tournament will have all six teams participate in single-elimination rounds with the top two teams receiving semifinal byes . [ 17 ] The Big West is the first Division I all-sports conference ( defined as a league that sponsors men 's and women 's basketball ) ever to sponsor men 's volleyball , and the second NCAA all-sports conference overall to sponsor men 's volleyball as a scholarship sport ( the first was the Division II Conference Carolinas ) . On November 26 , 2017 the Big West announced that they will add UC San Diego along with Cal State Bakersfield as its 10th and 11th members starting on July 1 , 2020 . Cal State Bakersfield , who are already a full Division I school and are currently competing in the Western Athletic Conference will become a full member effective July 1 , 2020 . UC San Diego who had failed to move up from Division II in its failed bids to the Big West in 2011 and April 2017 will go through the four year transition process to Division I and will become a full member effective July 1 , 2024 . UC San Diego 's men 's volleyball joined the Big West in 2017 , in advance of that sport 's 2018 season , and women 's water polo joined in 2019 . [ 18 ]",
