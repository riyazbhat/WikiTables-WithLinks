Alongside the factory , Godin had built all the amenities which he considered the workers should have ; housing , laundry facilities , a school , a theatre , gardens , a swimming pool , etc . In the grounds are a monument which remembers those Familistere men who lost their lives in the Great War , the Monument aux morts du Familist\u00e8re de Guise , sculpted by the brothers Jan et Jo\u00ebl Martel ( 1896-1966 ) . These brothers were well known as avant garde and cubist sculptors . Guise was also the scene of a fierce battle in 1914 when the 5th French Army , retreating before the advancing German armies , stopped their retreat and engaged with the enemy . The 5th Army was commanded by General Lanrezac and the Martel brothers were sculptors of the monument which marks this battle . Several photographs of the Lanrezac monument are shown below as are photographs of the Familistere monument aux morts",
