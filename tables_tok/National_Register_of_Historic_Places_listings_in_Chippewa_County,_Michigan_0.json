        "The original section of this house was built by fur trader and Sault pioneer John Johnston in 1815 , after his first house was burned by American troops in retaliation for Johnston 's aid of British forces in the War of 1812 . Johnston built an 1822 addition for his daughter Jane and her husband Henry Rowe Schoolcraft in 1822 . In 1910 , a tree fell on the house , demolishing the original 1815 section ; only the 1822 addition remains",
