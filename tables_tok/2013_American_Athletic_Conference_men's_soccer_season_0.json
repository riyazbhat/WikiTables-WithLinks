  "intro": "The 2013 American Athletic Conference men's soccer season is the 18th season of men's varsity soccer in the conference originally known as the Big East Conference. Following a period of turmoil and near-constant turnover of membership, culminating in a split into two leagues along football lines, the schools that sponsor FBS football sold the Big East name to the non-FBS schools, which began operating as the Big East Conference in July 2013. The FBS schools are operating under the original Big East charter with the new name of American Athletic Conference. This was the final season n the Big East/American for two member schools. Louisville and Rutgers will leave in 2014, respectively for the ACC and Big Ten."
