  "section_text": "The 1926 Calgary Canadians were Alberta 's first Memorial Cup champion . [ 2 ] The Memorial Cup was presented to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association ( CAHA ) in 1919 by the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) in remembrance of the soldiers who died fighting for Canada in World War I . [ 3 ] It was to be awarded to the junior hockey champions of Canada in an east versus west format . The eastern Canadian champion , who from 1932 won the George Richardson Memorial Trophy , met the western Canadian champion , winners of the Abbott Cup . [ 4 ] The first championship featured the University of Toronto Schools against the Regina Patricia ( now the Pats ) in a two-game , total-goals series . The University of Toronto Schools won the title easily , defeating Regina by scores of 14\u20133 and 15\u20135 to win the series with a total score of 29\u20138 . [ 2 ] The head-to-head competition for the Memorial Cup has changed formats several times . The CAHA moved to a best-of-three format in 1925 as the first team to win two games was declared the champion . [ 5 ] In 1938 , the series was increased to best-of-five , [ 6 ] and to best-of-seven in 1943 . [ 7 ] There were two exceptions to these formats . The 1949 final between the Montreal Royals and the Brandon Wheat Kings required an eighth game after the third game ended in a tie . [ 8 ] The 1971 final between the Quebec Remparts and the Edmonton Oil Kings was nearly canceled outright in the wake of controversy surrounding the inclusion of the previously outlawed Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) as the western league was allowed to use more over-age players and received a larger travel allowance from the CAHA . The differences were resolved , and an abbreviated best-of-three series was held in Quebec City . [ 9 ] While the Memorial Cup was not intended to be a challenge trophy , a team has twice challenged the defending champion for the cup . After the Toronto Canoe Club defeated the Selkirk Fishermen in 1920 , they were met with a challenge by the Fort William Beavers for the trophy . Toronto agreed , and easily defeated Fort William 11\u20131 in a single game playoff . [ 10 ] The second challenge occurred a half-century later , in 1970 . The WCHL 's Flin Flon Bombers challenged the Montreal Junior Canadiens . Considered an outlaw league by the CAHA , WCHL teams were not permitted to participate in the Memorial Cup playoffs . The Junior Canadiens declined the challenge . [ 11 ] TG = total goals . The team that scored the most goals in two games won the championship . From 1925 onward , the total represents the number of games won",
