        "Dates from the 12th century , with a large 15th-century pinnacled sandstone tower , a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church . There has been a clock on the tower since the early 18th century . There is a peal of eight bells in the tower . Tenor 28cwt in C. The original five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six , and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . Two additional bells , the gift of Brigadier Ommanney , were added in 1928 to complete the octave , which does still contain two of the Bilbie bells . The present clock , installed in 1903 , plays a verse of a hymn every four hours , at 8 am , noon , 4 and 8 pm , with a different hymn tune for every day of the week",

The paragraphs and descriptions below describe features of some of these towers. The organization follows Peter Poyntz-Wright's scheme for grouping the towers by what he understands to be roughly the date and group of mason-architects who built them. Poyntz-Wright's scheme came under criticism in the 1980s."
