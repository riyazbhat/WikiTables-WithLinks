Ashkenazim or Ashkenazi Jews are literally referring to `` German Jews . '' Many Ashkenazi Jews later migrated , largely eastward , forming communities in non German-speaking areas , including Bohemia ( Czech Republic ) , Hungary , Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Russia , Ukraine , Romania , Belarus , and elsewhere between the 10th and 19th centuries . As many of these countries share similar dishes , and were occupied by the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires until the end of World War I , the place where the dish originated is uncertain .",
