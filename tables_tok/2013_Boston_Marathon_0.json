  "intro": "The 2013 Boston Marathon took place in Boston, Massachusetts on Monday April 15, 2013. It was the 117th edition of the mass-participation Boston Marathon. Organized by the Boston Athletic Association, it was the second of the World Marathon Majors series to be held in 2013. Over 23,000 runners participated. Lelisa Desisa won the men's division with a time of 2:10:22. Rita Jeptoo won the women's division with a time of 2:26:25. More than $800,000 of prize money was awarded. The event was disrupted by a terrorist attack in which two consecutive explosions on the sidewalk near the finish line killed three spectators and injured 264 other people. The race was halted, preventing many participants from finishing. The attack received widespread international media attention."
