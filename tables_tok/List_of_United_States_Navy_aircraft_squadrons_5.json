  "section_title": "Fixed Wing Squadrons -- Training ( VT )",
  "section_text": "T-45 Goshawk T-6B Texan II T-44 Pegasus The VT designation was one of the original designations . It was established in 1921 to designate `` Torpedo Plane Squadron '' . From 1922 to 1930 it designated `` Torpedo & Bombing Squadron '' and from 1930 to 1946 `` Torpedo Squadron '' . [ 27 ] In 1946 all remaining Torpedo Squadrons and Bombing Squadrons ( VB ) were redesignated `` Attack Squadrons '' ( VA ) and the VT designation was retired . [ 28 ] From 1927 to 1947 training squadrons were designated `` VN '' . [ 29 ] From 1947 to 1960 training units were not designated as squadrons , they were `` units '' or `` groups '' called Basic Training Groups ( BTG ) , Advanced Training Units ( ATU ) , Jet Transition Training Units ( JTTU ) or Multi Engine Training Groups ( METG ) . On 1 May 1960 the VT designation was resurrected and existing flying training units were designated `` Training Squadrons ( VT ) '' . [ 29 ] There is no relationship between training squadrons designated VT in 1960 and the Torpedo or Torpedo and Bombing squadrons of the 1920s to 1940s There are two types of fixed wing training squadrons : Primary training squadrons train students in the first stage of flight training leading to selection to one of three advanced training pipelines for Aviators ( Rotary Wing , Strike or Multi-Engine ) or two advanced training pipelines for Flight Officers ( Multi Crew or Strike ) . The advanced training squadrons conduct the final stage of flight training leading to `` winging '' of the new Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard . Training squadrons are organized differently than the Navy 's operational squadrons as training squadrons do not own their own aircraft . All training aircraft are assigned to and maintained by the Training Air Wing to which the squadrons are assigned . The training squadrons are composed only of Instructors and Students , with all maintenance and support functions carried out by the Training Air Wing . Training aircraft are painted orange and white",
