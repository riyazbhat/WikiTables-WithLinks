After the 1901 merger, Alco made the Schenectady plant its headquarters in Schenectady, New York. One of the better-known locomotives to come out of the Schenectady shops was Central Pacific Railroad type 4-4-0 No. 60, the Jupiter (built in September 1868), one of two steam locomotives to take part in the Golden Spike Ceremony to celebrate the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad."
