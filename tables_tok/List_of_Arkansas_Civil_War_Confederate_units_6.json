  "section_text": "Most artillery units seem to have begun the war named for the city or county that sponsored its organization . In the Official Records , artillery units are most often referred to by the name of their battery commander . During the war , some effort was made to organize artillery units into battalions and regiments , but the units almost never functioned above the battery level , and were often broken out and fought as single gun sections . For these reasons the Arkansas artillery organizations are listed by several names . The Arkansas batteries which served primarily in the Confederate Army of Tennessee or Army of Mississippi , ( east of the Mississippi River ) were `` officially '' designated as `` _st Arkansas Light Artillery '' . On November 19 , 1864 , General E. Kirby Smith , commanding the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department , issued Special Orders No . 290 , organizing the artillery of the department into battalions , and listing the various batteries as `` _st Arkansas Field Battery '' . The component batteries rarely , if ever , operated together . They were usually assigned individually to an infantry or cavalry brigade . [ 139 ]",
