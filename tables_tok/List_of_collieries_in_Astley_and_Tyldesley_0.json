        "Astley Green Colliery was sunk by a subsidiary of the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company immediately to the north of the Bridgewater Canal to exploit the deep coal seams under Chat Moss where the exposed coalfield dips under the Permian strata . Shaft sinking started in 1908 and the pit opened in 1912 . The colliery was absorbed into Manchester Collieries in 1929 and nationalised in 1947 . The pit closed in 1970 and is now the site of Astley Green Colliery Museum",

        "St George 's Colliery , Back o't ' Church , opened in 1866 south of Tyldesley Station . Its two shafts were sunk by Astley and Tyldesley Coal and Salt Company to the Rams mine . It was linked to Gin Pit Colliery for ventilation . A third shaft to the Trencherbone mine was sunk in 1884 and was deepened to the Arley mine . The colliery worked the Seven Foot mine until 1929 when it became part of Manchester Collieries and ceased coal production in 1941 but was retained for ventilation until 1964",
