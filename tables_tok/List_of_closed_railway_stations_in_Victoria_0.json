  "intro": "This is a list of former railway stations and railway lines in Victoria, Australia. Many of these stations and lines have been abandoned or demolished. There is a strong desire by communities to have many of these re-opened to better link Regional Victoria to the state capital Melbourne. Public transport has become increasingly popular in the 21st century for environmental, convenience and affordability reasons. For closed railway stations in suburban Melbourne, see List of closed railway stations in Melbourne."
