  "intro": "Expressways are the highest class of roads in India. National Expressways Authority of India (NEAI) operating under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will be in-charge of the construction and maintenance of expressways. The National Highways Development Project by Government of India aims to expand the expressway network and plans to add an additional 18,637 km (11,580 mi) of expressways by 2022 apart from existing national highways. The central government is the major investor in creating expressways. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are the only states which are investing in expressway building by having dedicated expressway corporations. Bharatmala, a centrally-sponsored and funded road and highways project of the Government of India with a target of constructing 83,677 km (51,994 mi) of new highways, has been started in 2018. Phase I of the Bharatmala project involves the construction of 34,800 km of highways (including the remaining projects under NHDP) at an estimated cost of \u20b95.35 lakh crore (US$75 billion) by 2021-22. In India, National Highways are at-grade roads, whereas Expressways are controlled-access highways where entrance and exit is controlled by the use of ramps that are incorporated into the design of the expressway. Some roads are not access controlled, but still are named as expressways, such as the Biju Expressway."
