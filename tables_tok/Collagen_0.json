  "section_text": "The collagen protein is composed of a triple helix , which generally consists of two identical chains ( \u03b11 ) and an additional chain that differs slightly in its chemical composition ( \u03b12 ) . [ 29 ] The amino acid composition of collagen is atypical for proteins , particularly with respect to its high hydroxyproline content . The most common motifs in the amino acid sequence of collagen are glycine-proline-X and glycine-X-hydroxyproline , where X is any amino acid other than glycine , proline or hydroxyproline . The average amino acid composition for fish and mammal skin is given . [ 29 ]",

  "intro": "Collagen /\u02c8k\u0252l\u0259d\u0292\u026an/ is the main structural protein in the extracellular matrix in the various connective tissues in the body. As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. Collagen consists of amino acids bound together to form a triple helix of elongated fibril known as a collagen helix. It is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and skin. Depending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone), compliant (tendon), or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). It is also abundant in corneas, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous, muscles. The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen. Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed. Collagen has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin. The name collagen comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (k\u00f3lla), meaning glue, and suffix -\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd, -gen, denoting producing."
