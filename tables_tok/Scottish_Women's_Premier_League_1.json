  "intro": "The Scottish Women's Premier League (SWPL) is the highest level of league competition in women's football in Scotland. The league consists of two divisions, SWPL 1 and SWPL 2, each with eight teams and is owned and managed by Scottish Women's Football. The league was formed in 2002 when the Premier Division of the Scottish Women's Football League (SWFL) broke away to form the SWPL. Initially operating as a single division of twelve teams, the current format was introduced in 2015 with the creation of SWPL 2. The champions and runners-up of SWPL 1 qualify directly for the Round of 32 of the UEFA Women's Champions League. Since 2009 the league has operated a summer season, running from March to November each year."
