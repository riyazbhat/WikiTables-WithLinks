During the attack , Hicks tried to pull the dogs off of Winfrey , but he was also attacked and suffered non-life threatening injuries . Neighbors also intervened by throwing rocks at the dogs during the incident . After the attack , Winfrey underwent surgeries to remove both eyes and one leg . Winfrey died one week after the attack . Hicks was charged with misdemeanor possession of crack cocaine , and there was speculation as to whether or not the dogs may have gotten into some narcotics , but the dogs were too aggressive to test without anesthetics , which would have polluted the sample . The dogs were scheduled to be euthanized"
