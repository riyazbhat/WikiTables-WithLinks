  "intro": "This is a list of business schools in South Africa. For the purposes of this list business schools are defined as accredited, degree-granting, postsecondary institutions. Institutions are accredited in South Africa by the Council on Higher Education (CHE), whilst institutions also pursue international accreditation from AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB. Founded in 1949, the University of Pretoria's now defunct Graduate School of Management was the first business school in South Africa and was the first MBA programme to be launched outside of North America, whilst the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business and University of Stellenbosch Business School, founded in 1964, are the oldest business schools in continuous operation. Founded in 2005, the Nelson Mandela University Business School is the newest business school in South Africa."
