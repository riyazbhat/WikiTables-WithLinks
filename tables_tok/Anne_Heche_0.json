  "intro": "Anne Celeste Heche (/he\u026a\u0283/ HAYSH; born May 25, 1969) is an American actress, director, and screenwriter. Following a dual role in the daytime soap opera Another World (1987-91), she came to mainstream prominence in the late 1990s with the films Donnie Brasco (1997), Volcano (1997), Six Days, Seven Nights (1998), and Return to Paradise (1998). In 1998, Heche portrayed Marion Crane in Gus Van Sant's horror remake Psycho. A highly publicized relationship with comedian Ellen DeGeneres was followed by a significant downturn in Heche's career, although she has continued to act, appearing in the well-received independent films Birth (2004), Spread (2009), Cedar Rapids (2011), Rampart (2011), and Catfight (2016). In 2004, Heche received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the Lifetime movie Gracie's Choice and a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play for her work in Broadway's Twentieth Century. She has starred in the television series Men in Trees (2006-08), Hung (2009-11), Save Me (2013), Aftermath (2016), and The Brave (2017)."
