  "intro": "This article is a list of the active and all-time National Hockey League (NHL) franchise post-season appearance, post-season series win, Stanley Cup Finals and Stanley Cup droughts up to and including the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. Those teams which have never made it in franchise history are listed by the season that they entered the league, either as a new franchise or when they merged into the NHL from the defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) league. Note: These lists do not include the cancelled 2004-05 NHL season. Among the current 31 NHL teams, 11 have never won the Stanley Cup. Additionally, one of the Original Six franchises - the Toronto Maple Leafs - has a Stanley Cup drought that includes the entire expansion era (51 seasons and counting). With the Vegas Golden Knights winning the Western Conference in 2018, there are only four franchises that have never reached the Stanley Cup Finals. Of those four, the oldest is the Arizona Coyotes (previously the Winnipeg Jets) (38 seasons), while the Maple Leafs have an even longer drought (51 seasons). The longest Stanley Cup championship drought in history was that of the New York Rangers, broken in 1994 after 53 seasons. The Maple Leafs have the current longest active Stanley Cup championship drought at 51 seasons and counting. In 2010, the Chicago Blackhawks ended what was the second-longest ever Stanley Cup championship drought at 47 seasons (now the sixth-longest). The end of that drought was the first of three consecutive years in which one of the eleven longest such droughts was broken (Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, Boston Bruins in 2011, and Los Angeles Kings in 2012). The Florida Panthers have the longest active win drought (22 seasons)."
