  "intro": "The North County Transit District (NCTD) (reporting mark NCTC) is the agency responsible for public transportation in North San Diego County, California, United States. NCTD provides 12 million passenger trips per year. NCTD's geographic area is approximately 1,020 square miles (2,600 km2) with an approximate population of 842,000 people. NCTD is governed by a Board of Directors. The agency owns the COASTER commuter rail service between Oceanside and Santa Fe Depot, and the SPRINTER light rail service between Oceanside and Escondido, both operated under contract by Bombardier. NCTD also owns the BREEZE bus service, LIFT paratransit service, and FLEX on-demand and point-deviation service. NCTD owns 62 miles (100 km) of mainline track from the Orange County-San Diego County line to the San Diego Santa Fe Depot (entirely used by Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, Metrolink, and BNSF Railway). It also owns the 22 miles (35 km) Escondido Branch that has been used by the Sprinter and the Pacific Sun Railroad since 2008. The Coaster commuter rail service runs on 41.1 miles (66.1 km) of the mainline; on the stretch between the Oceanside Transit Center and the San Diego Santa Fe Depot. The North County Transit District owns and maintains two rail yards for their Coaster commuter rail service. The first yard is the main maintenance and servicing facility located north of Oceanside at Stuart Mesa on Camp Pendleton, and it is shared with Metrolink and the Pacific Sun Railroad. The second yard is shared with the San Diego Trolley at 12th & Imperial in Centre City San Diego; this rail yard stores trainsets during mid-days until they're ready to be used again for northbound services."
