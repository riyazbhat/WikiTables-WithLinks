  "section_title": "Continental Double -- League & Europa League Double",
  "section_text": "The UEFA Europa League ( formerly the UEFA Cup ) , with a domestic league title win , offers the chance for a club to win a lesser European double ; but arguably a more prestigious achievement than a domestic double . This has been completed on fourteen occasions .",
  "uid": "Double_(association_football)_184",
  "intro": "The Double, in association football, is the achievement of winning a country's top tier division and its primary cup competition in the same season. The lists in this article examine this definition of a double, while derivative sections examine much less frequent, continental instances. The Double can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as doing the double over a particular opponent. The first club to achieve a double was Preston North End in 1889, winning the FA Cup and The Football League in the inaugural season of the league. The team that holds the record for the most doubles is Linfield of Northern Ireland, with a total of 24."
