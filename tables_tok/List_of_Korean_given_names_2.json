  "intro": "This is a list of Korean given names by type. Most Korean given names consist of two Sino-Korean morphemes each written with one hanja. There are also names with more than two syllables, often from native Korean vocabulary. Finally, there are a small number of one-syllable names. Originally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names, but since 1993, regulations in South Korea have prohibited the registration of given names longer than five syllable blocks, in response to some parents giving their children extremely long names such as the 16-syllable Haneulbyeollimgureumhaennimbodasarangseureouri (\ud558\ub298\ubcc4\ub2d8\uad6c\ub984\ud587\ub2d8\ubcf4\ub2e4\uc0ac\ub791\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b0\ub9ac). Lists of hanja for names are illustrative, not exhaustive."
