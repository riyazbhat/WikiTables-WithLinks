        "Fr\u00e4nkische Bratwurst is composed of beef , pork or veal and is traditionally served with sauerkraut or potato salad or simply in a breadroll . They vary greatly in size and seasoning from region to region but are often considerably thinner than the equivalents elsewhere in Germany . The best-known sausages are from Nuremberg ( N\u00fcrnberg ) and are recognisable by their small size and clearly visible herb seasoning . They are traditionally served as three sausages in a roll ( Drei in ' a Weckla ) or six sausages on sauerkraut ( Sechs auf Kraut )",
