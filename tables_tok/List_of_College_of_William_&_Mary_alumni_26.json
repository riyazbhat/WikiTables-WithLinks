  "intro": "The College of William & Mary, located in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States, was founded in 1693 by a royal charter issued by King William III and Queen Mary II. It is a public research university and has more than 94,000 living alumni. Alumni of William & Mary have played important roles in shaping the United States. Three of the country's first ten presidents were educated there; only Harvard University, which educated five, can claim more. The school is also the alma mater of four United States Supreme Court justices (including its longest-serving chief justice, John Marshall). Because the school was one of the few colleges existing in the Colonies, many colonial era notables enrolled including four signers of the Declaration of Independence and the first president of the Continental Congress, Peyton Randolph.
