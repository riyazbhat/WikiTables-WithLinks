  "intro": "The Washington Metro (commonly called Metro, and branded Metrorail) is a rapid transit system serving Washington, D.C. and neighboring communities in Maryland and Virginia, both inside and outside the Capital Beltway. With an average weekday ridership of 764,300, the Washington Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the United States, behind the New York City Subway. As of 2015[update], the system has 91 active stations spread out on six lines with 117 miles (188 km) of tracks. Six more stations are planned in 2020 as part of the Phase II of the Silver Line and an infill station at Potomac Yard is planned to open in 2021 on the Yellow and Blue lines. The Washington Metro system was conceived as an alternative to the construction of a large freeway system throughout the Washington, D.C. area and was partially financed with funds originally dedicated to highway construction. Construction began in 1969, and in 1976 the first section of the Metro system opened along the Red Line between the Rhode Island Avenue and Farragut North stations in Washington, D.C. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, more stations were opened in the city and the suburban communities of Arlington County, the City of Alexandria, and Fairfax County in Virginia as well as Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland. By 1991, five rail lines were open: the Red, Blue, Green, Orange, and Yellow Lines. The system as originally planned was completed in 2001 with the extension of the Green Line to Branch Avenue. In 2004, three stations were opened: an extension of the Blue Line to the Largo Town Center and Morgan Boulevard stations and the first infill station, NoMa-Gallaudet U. In 2014, the Silver Line opened with five new stations: Greensboro, McLean, Spring Hill, Tysons Corner, and Wiehle-Reston East. Nine Metrorail stations are officially designated transfer stations, although other intermediate stations also allow passengers to transfer between lines."
