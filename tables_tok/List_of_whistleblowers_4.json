When he refused to keep silent about his discoveries , he was fired from his position at the state . Kruszewski won settlements for both a First Amendment case against the state of Pennsylvania as well as his first Qui tam lawsuit against the hospital . In the cases against pharmaceutical giants , Pfizer and AstraZeneca , Kruszewski highlighted clinical science that was misrepresented by the defendants in their marketing and promotion of certain drugs . He also demonstrated problems with off-label marketing ( marketing that promotes uses , patients or doses that are not approved by the US FDA ) which resulted in heightened , but often non-transparent , risk to the health of patients and exceptional costs to taxpayers and state and federal governments",

        "According to the research of Pearse , lobby groups representing the largest fossil fuel producing or consuming industries in Australia referred to themselves as the Greenhouse Mafia . These groups are represented in Canberra by the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network ( AIGN ) . AIGN members boasted to Pearse in recorded interviews how they routinely gained access to what should be confidential information concerning government policy on energy and transport . Pearse cited recorded interviews with AIGN members and said that lobbyists had written cabinet submissions , ministerial briefings , and costings in two departments on at least half a dozen occasions over a decade . According to Pearse , those within groups lobbying for unrestricted greenhouse gas emissions have been able to ensure that government ministers hear mostly matching advice from their own departmental officials . Pearse says that this influence is entrenched to such an extent that fossil fuel industry lobby groups have actually been writing Australia 's greenhouse policy at least since the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 , and probably even before John Howard became Prime Minister in 1996 . Disillusioned , Pearse became a whistleblower , and in July 2007 , Pearse released his book on the subject , High & Dry : John Howard , Climate Change and the Selling of Australia 's Future . In early 2007 , Clive Hamilton wrote his book titled Scorcher : The Dirty Politics of Climate Change , drawing heavily on Pearse 's research",

He took all the captured cell phones of the paramilitaries in the legal proceedings , made the crossing and discovered a huge amount of coincidences , that is , paramilitaries and many prosecutorial officials communicated permanently . Congressman Gustavo Petro presented that debate to Congress introduced Mr. Ria\u00f1o and it was made public . In addition to the Attorney General 's Office , that infiltration would reach the national police , the army , the prison system , the intelligence agency , the Supreme Court of Justice and the Colombian Congress itself . The investigation took as a starting point the crossing of information referring to facts in which the violation of human rights occurred , which contained the names of the leaders of the most important paramilitary groups of the moment . That infiltration and the paramilitary actions were aimed at eliminating the political opposition , in order to definitely install the Uribe as the family in power . The hacker of the Prosecutor 's Office directly holds former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe responsible for that situation . The reprisals against the Hacker were swift : house raids and home searches , telephone interception , 24-hour surveillance , judicial complaint , and dismissal , took the situation to a limit that led to the request of refuge in Canada , where Maok Ria\u00f1o resides 15 years ago",

City officials and pension board trustees created a multi-year smear campaign , including filing ethics charges against her and plotting to have her arrested by the San Diego City Police . The scandal caused widespread fallout in the city 's political and financial sectors . Several city officials resigned , including the City Auditor , City Manager , City Treasurer and the Mayor . The City became the target of two federal investigations and in November 2006 , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission entered an order sanctioning the City of San Diego for committing securities fraud .
