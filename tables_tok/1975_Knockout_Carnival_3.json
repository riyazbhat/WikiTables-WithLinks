  "intro": "The 1975 Knockout Carnival was the 19th Australian National Football Carnival, an Australian rules football interstate competition. The tournament was won by Victoria. The 1975 carnival represented a significant change in format for the carnival. Previous carnivals had all been played as a stand-alone event in a single host city, with each team playing the others in a round robin competition; but the 1975 carnival was played as a shortened knock-out tournament and split between two cities. Just three games were played: two semi finals and a final. The semi-finals were played as a double-header in Melbourne, and the final was contested a month later in Adelaide. Unlike previous carnivals, no All-Australian team or Tassie Medalist was chosen."
