The main groups , from Haswell-Smith ( 2004 ) , in many cases provide a more useful guide to location than local authority areas . These groups are : Firth of Clyde , Islay , Firth of Lorn , Mull , Small Isles , Skye , Lewis and Harris , Uists and Barra , St Kilda , Orkney , Shetland and Firth of Forth . In a few cases where the island is part of either a recognisable smaller group or an archipelago , or is located away from the main groups , an archipelago , local authority or other descriptive name is used instead . `` F '' designates a freshwater island . Scotland 's islands include thirteen Munros ( mountains with a height over 3,000 feet or 914.4 metres ) , twelve of them found on Skye , and a total of 227 Marilyns ( hills with a relative height of at least 150 metres , regardless of absolute height ) .

  "intro": "This is a list of islands of Scotland, the mainland of which is part of the island of Great Britain. Also included are various other related tables and lists. The definition of an offshore island used in this list is land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways. [Note 1]\nScotland has over 900 offshore islands, most of which are to be found in four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, sub-divided into the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are also clusters of islands in the Firth of Clyde, Firth of Forth, and Solway Firth, and numerous small islands within the many bodies of fresh water in Scotland including Loch Lomond and Loch Maree. The largest island is Lewis and Harris which extends to 2,179 square kilometres, and there are a further 200 islands which are greater than 40 hectares in area. Of the remainder, several such as Staffa and the Flannan Isles are well known despite their small size. Some 94 Scottish islands are permanently inhabited, of which 89 are offshore islands. Between 2001 and 2011 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The geology and geomorphology of the islands is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull are mountainous, while others like Tiree and Sanday are relatively low lying. Many have bedrock made from ancient Archaean Lewisian Gneiss which was formed 3 billion years ago; Shapinsay and other Orkney islands are formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is 400 million years old; and others such as R\u00f9m from more recent Tertiary volcanoes."
