  "section_text": "The administrative division of the Western Macedonia region in municipalities . In shades of yellow , the former Kastoria Prefecture , in red , the Grevena Prefecture , in blue , the Kozani Prefecture , and in green , the Florina Prefecture As one of thirteen administrative regions , the Western Macedonia Region ( Greek : \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 , Perif\u00e9ria Dytik\u00eds Makedon\u00edas ) was established in 1987 , comprising the prefectures of Kastoria , Grevena , Kozani and Florina . In the absence of a working budget the administrative regions however remained unable to fulfill even their limited responsibilities , until in 1994 they assumed the prefectures ' competences in regard to tax collection , European structural funding and treasury . [ 4 ] Resulting from the 2010 Kallikratis Programme , prefectures were abolished and instead , the regions became self-governing bodies in their own right with powers and authority being redefined and largely extended . Starting with the 2010 local elections , both the regional governor and the regional council have been popularly elected . [ 5 ] From 2014 on , the elections are held together with the European Parliament elections for a five-year period . The region is based at Kozani and is divided into four regional units ( the pre-Kallikratis prefectures ) . It comprises 12 municipalities ( down from 61 pre-Kallikratis local administrative units ) . Along with the neighboring Epirus region it is supervised by the Ioannina-based Decentralized Administration of Epirus and Western Macedonia .",

Located in north-western Greece, it is divided into the regional units of Florina, Grevena, Kastoria, and Kozani. With a population of approximately 280,000 people, as of 2017, the region had one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union."
