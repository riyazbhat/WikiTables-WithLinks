  "intro": "The 2004 Liga Super (English: 2004 Super League) also known as the Dunhill Liga Super, based from the original format of the first season (1994/1995) and second season (1995/1996) of the Indonesian league premier division, is the inaugural season of the Liga Super, the new top-tier professional football league in Malaysia. The season was held from 14 February and concluded in 14 August 2004. This league participated by 8 teams, six west teams and two east teams, Sabah and Sarawak. The original Indonesian format with the same name, first organized 10 years ago from November 1994 till July 1995, participated by 34 teams divided by 17 west teams and 17 east teams. The Liga Super champions for 2004 was Pahang. Pahang dominated the season and ended up winning the title by a wide margin and this was down to their efforts in securing the services of the nation's top players prior to the start of the new season. Pahang's Indra Putra Mahayuddin was the season's top goalscorer with 15 goals. He held the record as the only local players which won the accolade until the end of 2009 season. The highest scoring match of the season was Perlis 6-2 defeat of Kedah on 31 July 2004. A plus point was the surprisingly strong finish of club side Public Bank. At this time, the Football Association of Malaysia were trying to promote clubs as the future of Malaysian football."
