  "intro": "Holby City is a medical drama television series that began airing in January 1999 on BBC One in the United Kingdom. The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the established BBC medical drama Casualty. The series follows the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at Holby City Hospital. It features an ensemble cast of regular characters, and began with 11 main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of 10 to 20 main actors employed on the show at any given time."
