Soviet officials expected the flag bearer to show an example of an attractive , physically strong person and a distinguished athlete . He was expected to carry the flag through the Olympic ceremony in one hand unsupported by a harness . This presented a formidable physical task as the flag weighed 16 kilograms ( 35 lb ) in the 1960s , and a sudden wind might further increase the physical load . Hence the Soviet flag bearers at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics were selected from among heavyweight weightlifters or wrestlers , who did not have to compete the next day . [ 1 ] Soviet officials also expected the flag bearer to win a gold medal at the given Olympics . This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics , when the selected flag bearers , Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively , were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal . Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters . Kutsenko placed second at the 1950 World Championships and Medvedev won the world title in 1956 and 1957 .
