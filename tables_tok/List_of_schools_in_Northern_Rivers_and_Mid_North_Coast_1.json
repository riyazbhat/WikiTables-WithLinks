  "section_text": "In New South Wales , a high school generally covers Years 7 to 12 in the education system , and a central or community school , intended to provide comprehensive education in a rural district , covers Kindergarten to Year 12 . An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses . While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within its defined school boundaries , some schools are either specialist in a given Key Learning Area , or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance . Grafton High School is the only selective school in the Northern Rivers region .",

The New South Wales education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from kindergarten to Year 6 (ages 5-12), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12 (ages 12-18)."
