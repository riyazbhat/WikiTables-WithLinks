  "intro": "Season two of Dancing with the Stars premiered on January 5, 2006, on the ABC network. This season expanded each program from an hour to 90 minutes, and added an hour-long results show the following night (in the first season no couples were eliminated in the first week; the first couple was eliminated at the end of the second episode, the second couple at the end of the third episode, and so on). Two couples were declared safe in an earlier portion of the show, the remaining couples were then named off until only the bottom two were left (the last two couples had the fewest votes, with the exception of week seven, where the show explicitly stated that the order of all but the eliminated couple was random). On February 24, 2006, 98 Degrees singer Drew Lachey and Cheryl Burke were announced the winners, marking the first win for Burke."
