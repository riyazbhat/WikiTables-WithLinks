He was also convicted of attempting to murder Mrs Russell 's nine-year-old daughter Josie , who suffered serious head injuries . He has continued to assert his innocence since his conviction . His original conviction was overturned on appeal but a second trial in 2002 resulted in another guilty verdict after another prisoner claimed that Stone had confessed to the killings while on remand in jail . His most recent appeal , in 2004 , also failed ."

          "13-year-old Billie-Jo Jenkins was murdered on 15 February 1997 at the home where she lived with her foster parents . Her foster father , Si\u00f4n Jenkins , was charged with the murder and later convicted , but maintained his innocence . An appeal in 1999 against his conviction failed , but after a second appeal in August 2004 it was quashed by a court as unsafe and he was released on bail pending a retrial . The juries in two subsequent retrials were unable to reach verdicts , and a not guilty verdict was recorded in 2006 . Nobody else has been arrested since his acquittal and the case remains unsolved ."
